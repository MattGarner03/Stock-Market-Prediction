===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-24 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Newmont Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. By pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead. 
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by Karyn Ovelmen, our Chief Financial Officer, and Natascha Viljoen, our Chief Operating Officer, along with the rest of my executive leadership team. We will all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Can you please state our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website? We have begun the year with a strong operational performance, which in turn has driven a robust financial performance. These results enabled us to generate record first quarter free cash flow and have kept us on track to deliver on our full-year commitments. Last week, we also reached an important milestone for Newmont Corporation with the completion of our divestment program, positioning us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, return capital to shareholders, and apply our full attention to our go-forward portfolio. With the first quarter and our divestment program now under our belt, Newmont Corporation's priorities for 2025 remain clear and unchanged. First, to strengthen our safety culture. Second, to stabilize our 11 managed operations, and third, to execute on capital returns. Starting with our safety culture, for every person who works at Newmont Corporation, safety is more than a priority; it is a core value, one that is fundamental to who we are and how we operate. In the first quarter, we saw a notable decrease in the frequency of significant potential events that we are experiencing across our business, a key lagging indicator for safety performance. This improvement was driven by visible felt leadership in the field, a more consistent application of our safety systems, and an increased focus on learning from incidents and implementing corrective actions. Over the last year, we have been diligently undertaking a refresh of our safety work. With the completion of our divestment program and the clarity of our go-forward portfolio, this month, we launched Always Safe, our reinvigorated safety program focused on delivering a set of prioritized improvements across our portfolio of managed operations and projects, as well as our exploration and legacy sites. Moving to our operations, during the first quarter, we produced 1,500,000 ounces of gold and 35,000 tonnes of copper, in line with our full-year guidance and the indications we provided on our last earnings call. As a consequence, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.2 billion in free cash flow, both first-quarter records. On the back of safe and stable operating performance, these results were favorably impacted by the rise in gold prices in recent months, driven by unprecedented volatility in our global financial and commodity markets. Although it is still early days, we are closely monitoring the evolving tariff situation and are very much focused on managing the variables that are within our control. I'm really pleased we have successfully completed the divestment of all six of our high-quality non-core operations through the program we announced early last year. In February, we finalized the sale of Musselwhite and Eleonore in Canada and Cripple Creek and Victor here in the United States. Last week, we completed the sale of Porcupine in Canada and Ahafo in Ghana. From these five transactions, we have now received more than $2.5 billion in after-tax cash proceeds this year. When you combine these proceeds with those from the sale of Telfer and our other investments last year, we have generated a total of $3.2 billion in after-tax cash proceeds. On top of that, when valued at today's prices, we now have nearly $1.2 billion in both equity and deferred consideration. This is a significant milestone for Newmont Corporation, as the completion of this divestment program over the last year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on safely improving the performance of our go-forward portfolio of 11 managed operations and three projects in execution. To further strengthen our balance sheet, with $1.5 billion in debt retired over the last twelve months, including $1 billion repaid since the start of this year, and to deliver on our third priority, capital returns. We have now completed approximately $2 billion in share repurchases from our $3 billion program, including $755 million so far this year. Building upon our solid performance year to date and looking ahead to the rest of the year, we remain on track to achieve our 2025 commitments and progress our disciplined capital allocation priorities. As we move into the second quarter, we will continue to focus on safely generating industry-leading free cash flow, maintaining a strong financial position and investment-grade balance sheet, and returning capital to shareholders with predictable dividends and ongoing share repurchases. With that, I will now turn it to Natascha to take you through our operational performance and then Karyn to take you through our financial results and capital allocation achieved. Over to you, Natascha.
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom. Our first quarter operational results were in line with our previous indications, and we remain on track to meet our full-year guidance. With this in mind, from an operational standpoint, we are focused on two simple but very important objectives. First and foremost is continuing to strengthen our safety culture, as Tom covered at the start of his remarks. Second is executing with consistency and focus to deliver on our performance metrics. I will now stick through the progress we made during the last quarter at each of the large long-life assets in our portfolio. Starting with our Tier one copper-gold operation, Cadia, in the first quarter, Cadia delivered consistent production whilst also successfully completing planned maintenance activities at our mill. We are continuing the transition to our new panel cave, PC2-3, and expect gold and copper production to be approximately 60% weighted towards the first half of the year. As factored into our guidance, we expect to continue delivering lower grades until the panel cave is fully ramped up and the last drawbell is fired in the second half of 2026. In funding to the test, we are progressing the underground development for PC1-2, and we are also continuing to catch up on the historical underinvestment in both tailings remediation and storage capacity, as mentioned during our last earnings call. At Tanami, we focused on underground development as planned. As a direct result, we continue to expect to access higher-grade stopes in the third quarter and deliver more than a 30% step-up in production in the second half of the year. In addition, we are also advancing the expansion project at Tanami with the completion of the shaft and underground materials handling systems remaining on schedule. We completed the installation of a painter's or an inch shaft barrier, which is a significant milestone for the project. The painter's allows us to isolate the lower part of the shaft from work happening in the upper portion. With this barrier in place, we are able to rise for the bottom 60 meters of the shaft while concurrently fitting out the top portion with services and infrastructure without risk of harm to the people below. This is just one example of the innovative work our team is doing to safely and efficiently advance this project. Due to these efforts, we remain on track to begin commissioning our 1.5-kilometer shaft in the first half of 2027 and reach commercial production by the second half of that year. At Boddington, we completed our scheduled plant shutdown for maintenance and primarily processed lower-grade stockpiles in the first quarter. We continued stripping laybacks in both the north and south pits, which is expected to continue through early next year. However, by the fourth quarter, we expect to start adding higher-grade gold ore from the mine to our mill feed. As a result, we anticipate a strong finish to the year from Boddington, with gold production approximately 53% weighted to the second half of the year. Shifting now to Lihir, we delivered solid gold production in the first quarter and successfully completed a total plant shutdown for maintenance, building upon two autoclave rebuilds last year. We expect to maintain this production momentum into the second quarter. We saw production decline slightly in the second half of the year when we began processing lower-grade material as part of our planned mine sequence. Moving to Penasquito, in March, we achieved a new daily record with 10,000 gold equivalent ounces produced in a single day. In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong gold production and steady co-product production from high grades in the Finasco Pit. Gold production levels are expected to remain relatively steady through the second quarter before beginning to shift to a higher proportion of silver, lead, and zinc content through the third and fourth quarters and a lower proportion of gold, as planned. At our Ahafo complex, Ahafo South continued to deliver strong gold production from both the Subika Open Pit and underground operations. We expect this trend to continue through the second quarter before we move to mining lower-grade ore from the Awonsa Pit. As we mine the last ore and complete the final phase of the Subika Open Pit during the second quarter, we are closely monitoring and safely managing the interaction between the open pit and Subika underground mining activities beneath it. As production from Ahafo South declines in the second half of the year, we expect new low-cost ounces to come in from the Ahafo North project later this year. During the first quarter, we completed the highway diversion and are preparing to commence the commissioning of the mill and processing facilities next month. We expect to pour our first gold in the second half of the year, and we look forward to declaring commercial production towards the end of the year. Finally, I want to touch on two of the emerging Tier one assets in our portfolio. At Cerro Negro, our focus remains on strengthening safety performance and culture at this underground mine. Although there were temporary pauses in milling during the first quarter as part of our focused efforts to improve safety, the team did an excellent job stockpiling the ore mined and positioning Cerro Negro to ramp up production in the second quarter. Yanacocha has remained a strong performer, increasing production volumes by 13% over the last quarter. We expect to maintain this momentum through the rest of the year as we continue to recover ounces from the leach pads with the application of our patented injection leaching technology. Taking all of these factors into account and including the ounces from our non-managed assets, we continue to expect that gold production from our core portfolio will remain around 52% weighted towards the second half of the year, with approximately 24% of this year's production volumes expected in the second quarter. We also continue to anticipate that capital spend from our core portfolio will remain first-half weighted as indicated. With lower than planned capital expenditures for the first quarter, we expect sustaining capital spend at several of our global managed operations to increase in the second quarter, particularly at Cadia, where we are investing in a tailing strategy to support lift development and extend mine life, as mentioned in our last earnings call. I will now turn it over to Karyn for a review of our financial priorities and performance. Over to you, Karyn.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thanks, Natascha. Let's turn to the next slide and get started with our first quarter results. As Tom mentioned, Newmont Corporation reported strong financial results in the first quarter, driven by robust production volumes and a supportive gold price environment. Gold all-in sustaining costs remained in line with our full-year guidance at $1,651 per ounce for the first quarter. Taking this into account, Newmont Corporation delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and adjusted net income of $1.25 per diluted share. The most significant adjustments to net income for the quarter were $0.25 primarily related to a gain from the sale of non-core assets as part of the successful completion of our divestiture program that Tom mentioned previously, and $0.25 related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and options, primarily driven by an appreciation in the shares received from the sale of our Telfer operation and interest in the Havieron project. Most noteworthy, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.2 billion in free cash flow, setting a new record for first-quarter cash flow performance at Newmont Corporation. These results are exclusive of the $1.7 billion in after-tax proceeds received from the divestitures completed in the first quarter and the approximate $850 million received in April. However, as we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect working capital to be adversely impacted by the regular timing of cash tax payments, which are typically highest in the second quarter, and the timing of interest payments, which are typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to pay approximately $200 million in cash taxes related to the finalization of our non-core divestments. Although the proceeds are recorded as investing activities on the statement of cash flows, these tax payments will come through as working capital adjustments. Also impacting working capital, we expect to continue ramping up spending for the water treatment plants at Yanacocha, which was significantly lower than planned during the first quarter. Additionally, we expect our sustaining and development capital to increase into the second quarter compared to the first quarter, as Natascha just mentioned. With the recent completion of our divestiture program, our financial results will no longer include the production and associated free cash flow from our non-core operating assets, which was approximately $200 million in the first quarter. While we are pleased with our record cash performance during the first quarter and the strong cash flows we expect to generate in future quarters, we realize that we still have work to do to improve our margins and leverage the full strength of our portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we remain committed to our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects, and returning capital to shareholders. Beginning with our first commitment, we maintained a strong and flexible balance sheet and ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash, above our target average of $3 billion. It's worth noting that in addition to our cash balance, following the successful completion of our divestiture program, our equity stakes in Greatland Gold, Discovery Silver, and our existing position in Orla Mining are now valued at over $1 billion. As Tom mentioned, the proceeds generated from our non-core divestiture program have more than exceeded the initial commitment we made to the market when we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest in May of 2023. As a result, we achieved our debt target of up to $8 billion faster than originally anticipated, and we reached an outstanding principal balance of $7.8 billion as of March 31. Taking into account the strong gold price environment we are benefiting from today and the feedback we have received from our investors, we are continuing to assess opportunities to further reduce our outstanding debt, proactively creating a flexible and resilient balance sheet that is able to navigate commodity price fluctuations. Moving to the second commitment in our capital allocation strategy, we continued to steadily reinvest in our business with the goal of generating robust free cash flow over the long term. In the first quarter, we incurred $59 million in sustaining capital and $323 million in development capital as we continue to advance our highest return projects from our deep organic pipeline. As we look ahead, we expect capital spend at several of our managed operations to ramp up in the second quarter, as I just mentioned. Finally, moving to our third commitment, we continue to return capital to shareholders. We declared a fixed common first-quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with the past six quarters, and we repurchased $755 million in shares so far in 2025. As we continue to generate free cash flow from our unmatched portfolio of Tier one operations, we remain well-positioned to reward our shareholders with predictable dividends and ongoing share repurchases in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom. Thanks, Karyn.
Tom Palmer: So bringing it all together, we have had a safe and strong start to the year, producing 1,500,000 ounces of gold, 35,000 tonnes of copper, as well as 16 ounces of silver, and 59,000 tons of zinc, generating record first-quarter free cash flow of $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our 2025 guidance. We also completed our divestment program, receiving more than $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds this year. We continue to advance our disciplined capital allocation strategy, strengthening our balance sheet with $1 billion in debt reduction, as well as delivering $1 billion in shareholder returns through our predictable dividend and ongoing share repurchases so far this year. We are very focused on ensuring that we carry this momentum into the second quarter and the remainder of 2025. With that, I thank you for your time and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. We ask that you please limit inquiries to one primary question and one follow-up question. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your headset before asking a question. To withdraw your question, please press star followed by 2. Our first question comes from Matthew Murphy with the company BMO Capital Markets. Matthew, your line is now open.
Matthew Murphy: Hi. Congrats on the strong start to the year. Maybe just getting right into an operational question, looking through sort of the details on the quarter. Lihir cash cost dropped a lot, and I know you're focused on running it for margin. How should we think about the cash cost profile there? How is that program on mining for margin? Are you being surprised at all on the cost levels you're achieving?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I'll pick it up, and then Matt, then pass across to Karyn to build. Certainly, our focus in Lihir is very much about configuring the mine to sustainably work through particularly phase 14a. So our focus very much got through some big shutdowns last year. Full rebuild of two autoclaves, including the large one autoclave four, which is 40% of the throughput capacity. We took that back to the shell and then built it back out again. So a lot of activity in the second part of last year, getting the plant set with a couple of those big shutdowns and then configuring the mine to ensure we've got the roads of an appropriate size with the appropriate drainage. You'll see that step up in sustaining capital in the second quarter associated with continuing some of that work. So from a Lihir operations perspective, very much about setting both the mine and the processing plant up for stable, reliable performance. Karyn, do you want to pick up the specifics of Matt's question?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yeah, Matt, in terms of the cost at Lihir, there's approximately a $100 million impact from inventory adjustments in the quarter. This represents a non-cash impact to cash, and so that will normalize over time through the year. So the expectation is that Lihir will meet its full-year cost guidance.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then as a second question, just you've been very active on the buyback in April. I think you noted it would be related to the asset divestitures. Can you give any commentary about how you think about the pace of the buyback? Like, will it be a first-half-of-the-year weighted capital return because you've got more proceeds coming in, or do you look at maybe going at a slower pace over the rest of the year?
Karyn Ovelmen: Thanks, Matt. We're continuing to do the share buyback. We do have a build in cash, and as you pointed out, we do have the divestitures that came in, and the proceeds came in, in April. So that couples with our outlook in terms of the gold price, elevated gold price. So we will continue to do the share buyback as the cash flow comes in. Obviously, it's been a very robust share buyback program with the overperformance on the divestitures. So the proceeds from that, we're continuing to do share buybacks with. Then, of course, with the elevated gold price, we'll continue to do share buybacks through the remainder of the year and into next year.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Next question comes from Daniel Morgan with the company, Barron Joey. Daniel, your line is now open.
Daniel Morgan: Hi, Tom and team. Philosophical question. The gold price is near record highs, higher than I think any of us anticipated. What does this mean for how you manage your business, if anything? Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Hey. Good day, Dan. Thanks for the question. Been through a pretty significant transformation acquiring Newcrest, integrating those operations, configuring some of those new operations to deliver on their long-term potential, and completing a pretty ambitious divestment program over the last twelve months. So literally last week, we've got our hands on our go-forward portfolio. We're in an investment cycle. We've got unit costs that are high where they should be for a portfolio of the quality of the one we've assembled. We are very, very focused on delivering the safety, cost, and productivity performance this portfolio deserves irrespective of the gold price. We'll enjoy the benefit of the gold prices, but our focus is on delivering the potential of the 11 managed operations that we are currently operating, commissioning Ahafo North later this year, completing the shaft, commissioning that in '27, continuing to build out panel cave two-three through the course of this year and into next. Ultimately bringing on one-two in the years after that. So a very sober focus on what we control. Thanks, Dan.
Daniel Morgan: Oh, thank you. Then maybe just turning to growth. Could you just opine on which project might be coming to consideration, you know, to the board level or, you know, what the timeline is for the major projects that you might be considering over the next twelve months or more to sanction for investment?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. The starting point sort of linked to your earlier question is a very, very robust view on the amount of capital that we allocate towards development capital. The $1.3 billion is fully consumed at the moment with Ahafo North, the Tanami expansion, and the block caves at Cadia. But as we commission Ahafo North in the second half of this year, and importantly, as it ramps up and hits its straps in 2026, we have an opportunity to think about whether there is a project that deserves capital going forward. When I look at our project pipeline, I would argue that Red Chris is in prime position and it's spot to lose. But we've got work we're doing this year to build out a feasibility study to a JORC standard. There's quite a bit of work happening this year on that study. We continue to do some underground development work to continue to develop out some of the early works in that cave. It's important that we engage with the First Nations and the British Columbian government to ensure we've got the permits in place so that when, ultimately, if the project washes its face, we've got all pieces in place to build out that block cave. But as I look at our project pipeline, look at where we sit with Red Chris and the quality of that ore body, we've got another Cadia with multiple block caves ready to bring on. I think it's Red Chris' block cave's spot to lose in terms of the next project that we sanction.
Daniel Morgan: Thanks so much, Tom.
Operator: Next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek with the company Scotiabank. Tanya, your line is now open.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the tariffs, Tom. Sorry, I have a cold. I just wanted to ask about your initial work, and I understand that this tariff situation is quite fluid, but I'm trying to understand from a very high level. When you look at your cost structure, I'm interested in what part of your cost structure do you think will be greatly impacted by the addition of tariffs? So I'm gonna start first with the consumable side, which is about 30% of your cost structure. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what sort of consumables would you see being impacted. Then the second portion of the cost structure, obviously, is labor, which is a significant portion. That would come with inflation. Then I'm assuming another portion would be any sustaining capital that would involve new equipment, fleet, etcetera. So I'm interested if you have any new fleet replacement or other that happening this year. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya, and well done for getting through that with that cold. Obviously, as you say, lots of moving parts at the moment that we're monitoring closely. I'd also say that one of the benefits of having a globally diverse portfolio is we can manage these sorts of risks across our global business. So we're well placed from that perspective. Maybe just stepping through the different categories as you talked about. As you said, labor represents half of our cost base, our direct cost base. What we're seeing in terms of the labor, both our employees and the contract services, and we enter into long-term relationships with the various contractors, is consistent with what we're seeing in our budgeted amounts. So we're seeing no particular impacts in half of our cost base around some of the tariff volatility. Look at that 30% of materials and consumables and the different components that sit underneath that. Grinding media is heavily exposed to steel prices, so we are seeing a bit of upward pressure on grinding media. Again, we source that from a number of different locations. We have multiple supply chains with our operations around the globe. Ammonia and cyanide mixed trends, primarily being influenced by regional gas price fluctuations, and we're actually seeing some reduced natural gas prices in Europe. We're seeing some volatile natural gas costs in the US, so a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to ammonia and cyanide. We look at explosives. At this point in time, it's looking pretty flat. We'll keep monitoring that. Again, we continue to actively monitor particularly that materials and consumables area. We've got a global supply chain team. A lot of those arrangements are long-term, strategic in nature, and those relationships are robust. 15% of our cost is energy. If anything, we're seeing some tailwinds in the hedging price based upon what oil is doing. We're getting a little bit of a benefit from that. Lots of moving parts, monitoring it closely, but at this stage, what we're seeing is consistent with what we assured for this year. Hopefully, that provides some color for you, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Maybe just a follow-up on my sustaining capital question as well. Are you having to replace any significant fleet trucks at the operations this year? That could be impacted should...
Tom Palmer: Nothing specific for us, Tanya. The new mine at Ahafo North got fleet there now. It's been there for some time. Then I've got to look across the rest of our business, there's nothing in terms of fleet change out for our managed operations through the course of this year. You're then looking at rotables that may be more parts that you're buying that may come from different parts of the world. The two operations, the two areas that may start to see some tariff pressure would be Penasquito with some parts that you might buy for the US or Red Chris and Brucejack, but monitoring that closely, but in the overall scheme of things, nothing material.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And no labor contracts are expiring this year?
Tom Palmer: In terms of labor agreements, we've got an interesting one at Cadia, which is essentially an Australian workplace law. You've got some underpinning agreements that underpin our staff contracts. We're going through a negotiation with our team at Cadia. There's nothing particularly of note when it comes to tariff volatility. We've just completed one at Penasquito in recent times. We're working through one at Merian. Again, I would describe those negotiations as pretty standard fare, and nothing around tariff volatility that's part of those discussions. They're more domestic issues in terms of shift rosters and the like.
Operator: The next question comes from Lawson Winder with the company Bank of America. Lawson, your line is now open.
Lawson Winder: Thank you very much, operator, and hello, Tom and team. Nice quarterly results. Thank you for today's update. Could I ask about Ahafo North, a key project for Newmont Corporation? Could you maybe describe the progress in 2025 to date and how it's tracking to your expectations in terms of development ramp-up spend? Have there been any surprises, whether positive or negative? The question I really want to get to is when you turn to 2026 and think about the progress to date, is that run rate production level of 275,000 to 325,000 ounces expected to be achieved in that year?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I'll try to pick up the second part and get Natascha to... It's a pretty exciting time for Ahafo North as you've seen everything come out of the ground. The blueprint for Ahafo North is essentially the same as Merian and Ahafo South. Bringing on that mine and the processing facility is something we know well, and lots of people have got lots of experience commissioning that type of ore through that plan. What we've got in our guidance for next year and the ramp-up to those numbers is consistent with getting to commercial production towards the end of this year, then going through our paces to get up to that level. I wouldn't say, Lawson, there's upside to that. I think it's a robust view of bringing on a mine or a flow sheet that we know well through 2026. But, Natascha, do you want to sit back and talk about how the project's going here and now?
Natascha Viljoen: Yeah. I can probably... Hi, Lawson, just go into a little bit more of the details of what we've completed this year so far. I think the project is really tracking well. The first thing that's important for us, considering that we did lose a colleague when we lost Kirby last year, is, of course, safety. So there's a material amount of focus. We have... It's the high construction period that we're in now. We have high numbers of people on-site and making sure that the concurrent work, multiples of contractors on-site, are being done safely. A critical milestone for us to really start or continue the stripping and complete the tailings dam was the diversion of the highway diversion. That was completed. So we've managed to really get into the tailings dam and continue the stripping of the mine. Power lines and with high voltage switch yard completed, SAG and ball mill completed, and our CIL tank corrected. Currently, it's really that last bit of the plant we're into piping, into electrical, into cabling. So quite a bit of cabling coming in now. The critical part is absolutely on the plant cabling and piping to get ready for commissioning of the processing facilities. I think tracking well, good focus from a safety point of view, and we're all looking forward to the first gold pour.
Lawson Winder: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you for that, Natascha. If I could ask my follow-up question on Lihir. With the benefit of another quarter, what are you thinking now as a long-term sustainable level of gold production for that asset? You did 600,000 ounces last year. Obviously, we know you've got it to 600,000 this year. Is something in the middle, like 700,000, a good through-the-cycle average number to think of?
Tom Palmer: Yeah. I think, Lawson, if you look at Lihir, we're basically getting that pit configured to the size mine that it is and ensuring we've got the processing plant in good nick in terms of availability and reliability. As we configure that mine and build out phase 14a, we're in the lower grades of ore for the next couple of years. So you're in that period of configuring that mine and moving waste and therefore processing more low-grade ore and stockpile. I think, as I indicated in the February call, that we come out of that stripping campaign in the 2028 time frame. So you're going to be relatively consistent with where we are now, but as you step out of that stripping campaign and get into the high grades, you start to get into the, for an open pit mine, high twos in terms of grams per tonne. Then you're looking at about a 30% increase in gold production as you come through that. Our expectation will be how do you then start to ensure that you can maintain those production levels because we've got the mine appropriately configured going forward. So if you've taken the time to configure that pit properly, step away from the engineered wall around a minor rock, and do a more traditional layback. Then, as we've indicated, plus 30% increase in production on 2024 levels, kicking in from about 2028.
Lawson Winder: Thanks, Lawson. I think you probably have a tough question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hugo Nicolaci with the company Goldman Sachs. Hugo, your line is now open.
Hugo Nicolaci: Hi, Tom, Natascha, Karyn. Congrats on the strong start to the year. I also first just wanted to follow up on costs and the timing of costs moving into the second quarter. Look, I appreciate that this is largely on timing, but is there anything to call out in terms of work completions or equipment delivery that we should think about in terms of tangible impacts to production into the second quarter?
Tom Palmer: No. It's pretty vanilla, Hugo. Production in Q1 and Q2 will look very similar. Sustaining capital is the one we... I think it was in our prepared remarks, so a bit lighter in the first quarter. Then as we get into some final weather in different parts of the world, some increased standard of a bit more standardly here around roads and drainage. Brucejack, Red Chris as you get into the better weather. Some greater spend there. The 52% weighted sustaining capital in the first half of the year versus the second. So it's that balance account. You'll see higher sustaining capital spend in the second quarter, but everything is tracking with what we would expect. So it's no particular call-out at all.
Hugo Nicolaci: Great. Thanks for clarifying, Tom. Then just the second one picking up on Karyn's comments around the opportunities to repay debt early. How should we think about the objective there? I mean, is it debt levels or flexibility or interest costs? Just if I look at the debt facilities you have in place at the moment, other than the 2039 notes, most still have pretty compelling rates in today's environment. Your liquidity continues to grow organically on the capital management framework. So I guess the question is, with Goldverde, what do you think you need that flexibility for?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sure. No specific intent at this time, but as we move through this high gold price environment, coupled with a very uncertain economic time, we will look for opportunities to further buffer the balance sheet, right? So while we're continuing this reinvestment in the business and returning capital to shareholders, with the predictable dividend coupled with the continued share buyback. Well, if there's opportunities for us to continue to buffer that balance sheet, we'll look to do that. Again, we've got a robust share buyback program in place as a result of the gold price as well as the divestiture proceeds. Of course, we've got the dividend where it needs to be from a fixed predictable dividend that we believe the market will ascribe value to. So again, I think we have an opportunity here as we go forward to continue to shore up the balance sheet, but no specific intent at this point.
Operator: Next question comes from Daniel Major with the company UBS. Daniel, your line is now open.
Daniel Major: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks so much for the questions. The first one, well done on the execution in the divestments so far. When you look at the portfolio now, I know you've done what you've targeted, is it still optimal? Is there anything else in the portfolio you think could be monetized? I'm thinking specifically like Merian, Cerro Negro, relatively higher cost and smaller scale. Why do they sit in the core portfolio?
Tom Palmer: Yeah. Thanks, Daniel. I mean, it's been a significant body of work for us over the last three years to integrate and rationalize. The most important thing for us to do now is bed down our go-forward portfolio. We've literally had the go-forward portfolio for seven days. Ensuring that we're focused on safety, cost, and productivity delivering on the potential of the elephants in that portfolio, the big tier one assets, and then realizing the potential of those emerging tier one assets. Having a red hot go at realizing the potential of those emerging tier one assets. At the end of the day, if we can't see a pathway to tier one, then that's a decision down the track. But we're literally seven days into our go-forward portfolio with the full bandwidth of this leadership team. So our focus is getting after delivering on the potential of the tier ones and proving up the potential of the emerging tier ones. So that's very much our focus.
Daniel Major: Okay. Thanks. My follow-up on the cash returns, you clearly indicated the intention to return the divestment proceeds, at this kind of gold price environment, you generate a meaningful additional cash flow above that sort of level. I mean, could we expect buybacks to significantly exceed the divestment proceeds this year if the gold price stays at this sort of level?
Karyn Ovelmen: Right. So no change to our financial policies. Right? So we've talked about holding an average of $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet at quarter-end. So that'll be a higher balance in terms of the timing of our cash needs. But generally speaking, that's where our cash will be. We've always said up to $8 billion. Like I said, we'll continue to look at maybe some opportunities to bring that down a bit. Our debt cap and our sustaining capital are set. Beyond that, we've got the dividend that's also set, a fixed dollar dividend. So beyond that, any free cash flow that we're generating, the expectation is we will continue to return that capital via share buyback.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni with the company CIBC. Anita, your line is now open.
Anita Soni: Hi, Tom. Congratulations on a solid start to the year. Everyone's asked a lot of questions on capital allocation and probably have asked most of the questions that Tanya asked about tariffs. I guess, now at the point where I'm like, could you go through just from a geopolitical standpoint, the regions that you operate in, is there anything that you're thinking about or concerned about with not just tariffs, but more of a sort of a, you know, as, you know, foreign direct investment and foreign aid is pulled from various areas, are there any regions where you're concerned about your investments or changes in government stance on royalties and taxes and things like that?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita. I guess my initial reaction to that question is where Newmont Corporation chooses to operate has always been very deliberate. So we look to be in the jurisdictions where we are able to have respect for the rule of law, a stability or investment agreement is in place and respected, and the relationships we build with the governments are strategic and long-term. That's been very much part of Newmont Corporation's theme for a long time and very much part of how we shape a go-forward portfolio, which is globally diverse, helps balance out some of those risks. But I think about the different locations that we're in, whether that be Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ghana, Canada, Mexico, Suriname, Peru, and Argentina, they are all very robust jurisdictions and seeing certainly something we'll continue to monitor, but we certainly think about the length of time we've been in those jurisdictions, the relationships we have, you continue to manage those relationships constructively, but seeing no particular risks as we see the world in front of us.
Anita Soni: Okay. Thank you. Then just another follow-up, I guess, on capital allocation. You've done a path of, obviously, divestments and someone else just asked about was our first the rationalization to the portfolio, but are there any areas where you think you might want to improve your exposure? I guess the best way to put it? I'm just trying to understand with the cash balance that's obviously going to grow at these gold prices, are you looking to perhaps invest in some smaller scale projects or improve your sort of JV portfolio or things like that?
Tom Palmer: I think that we're pretty clear the work we've done to arrive at the portfolio we have, the discipline around the capital allocation to the development projects, and ensuring that we stick to that $1.3 billion discipline. As much about the cash you allocate to that as it is the project execution risk. No changes on that front. I think I was saying in one of the earlier questions, we've been through two or three years of pretty significant transformational change where we've had our hands on our go-forward portfolio projects, operations, and our joint ventures. I think very much focused on stability and safely delivering our commitments from our portfolio.
Operator: Next question comes from Andrew Bowler with the company Macquarie. Andrew, your line is now open.
Andrew Bowler: Good day, Tom and team. Thanks for not going on a exact day a lot last year, but just a question on the pipeline. I mean, obviously, you know, loud and clear. It sounds like Brucejack's sorry. Red Chris is certainly the next one off the rank. But in terms of Wafi Golpu, can you just give us an update as to how that's going? Any discussions you've had recently with the government or, you know, very loose timelines on that project, please?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Andrew. The process with Wafi Golpu, obviously, it's a joint venture with Harmony. We've had a framework MOU that shapes what our very competitive basis for ultimately a mineral development contract that then be converted into a special mining lease. We continue to work constructively with the PNG government and work very well with Harmony as our joint venture partners. We're very clear on boundaries at which we're prepared to negotiate. We continue to have robust discussions. We continue to regular engagement with the PNG government up to and including the Prime Minister. We look forward to continuing to have constructive engagement and to be able to convert, which I think is a very robust and competitive memorandum of understanding into a mineral development contract, and a special mining lease. But we're prepared to sit at the table and negotiate and take as much time needed to ensure that we have an agreement in place that ensures the capital intensity for a project of that size can get a return of that investment over time.
Andrew Bowler: Okay. Yeah. So first, you know, long story short, you're just at a stage where you're trying to hammer out a deal in terms of, you know, an economic share arrangement with the government essentially. Is that a good way to summarize?
Tom Palmer: Yeah. That is a good way to summarize it, Andrew, and it's really important you get those agreements in place at the start before we start making big commitments. So that's where we'll put the time and effort.
Operator: Our last question comes from Al Harvey with the company JPMorgan. Al, your line is now open.
Al Harvey: Yes. Good morning. Good day, Al. So I just quick follow-up on the divestments. You did mention you've still got some value there in the equity stakes in Greatland and Discovery. So just wanted to get a sense of the option for these and just remind us of any lockup periods on those stakes.
Tom Palmer: Yeah. Thanks, Al. There are some lockup periods on those different agreements. I don't actually have that at the tip of my fingers. I'm looking across at Peter Toth in the room, who can maybe talk to both of those. Discovery's definitely got a lockup of the order of twelve months. We just closed that transaction in the last week. Then Greatland's linked to their listing on the ASX, and that's getting a little bit of media coverage in Australia as they gear up for that in the June time frame. Then the ability to maybe think about what that holding might look like and how we might transact. So there are some lockups and also some listings on the ASX to go to happen, Al.
Al Harvey: Sure. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, man.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for making the time to join this call. For the Australians on the call, hope to get some time off for Anzac Day and a bit of time to reflect upon the sacrifices that others have made. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day or evening. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-20 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to Newmont's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After the today’s presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for making the time to join our call. Today, I'm joined by Karyn Ovelmen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Natascha Viljoen, our Chief Operating Officer; along with the rest of my executive leadership team and will all be available to answer your questions, at the end of the call. Please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. I would like to start by taking a moment to provide an update on our safety performance. Newmont is a values-driven organization and ensuring the health and safety of our workforce, is at the very heart of everything we do. We are working diligently to strengthen our safety performance and have been reviewing and refreshing key safety programs across our global business, centered around three key areas: culture, systems and skill development. Maintaining and improving our culture of keeping everyone who works at Newmont always safe, relies on having simple well-governed systems and standards to guide safe operations, along with a process to identify and then implement ongoing improvements. We're also enhancing our frontline leadership capabilities by strengthening our asset management, team leadership and task assignment training and supporting it, with a fair consistent accountability framework. This improve of work will empower everyone at Newmont to confidently make decisions to drive safe, productive work each and every day. Turning now to our operational and financial performance last year. 2024 was a transformational year for Newmont. We took some very important steps to unlock the value of everything we have done so far on our journey to build a world-class company with an outstanding portfolio of assets that will generate value and long-term success for decades to come. In 2024, we focused on three areas: first, to complete the integration of the acquired assets; second, the rationalization of our portfolio; and third, the stabilization of our business. Both operationally and financially at a time where there is excitement of the demand dynamics we are witnessing, especially in the gold markets, but also at a time when Newmont and the broader mining industry have some challenges to work through. Let me start with the integration of our new operations. As with any acquisition, this is large and complex work. We have run into a few specific hurdles that we will need to clear before the true potential of these assets becomes evident in both our production and financial results. Two challenges have been Cadia and Lihir, and we are addressing them in a way that will position these assets to thrive and deliver on their underlying multi-decade potential. As we address the challenges at both these assets, we are ensuring that we have robust operational and technical plans, sitting behind the sustaining capital spend needed to get them up to a Newmont and Tier 1 level. We acquired these assets with a view to creating value over a period of decades and the investments that we're making now will set us up to deliver on that objective. We are putting this work in motion with focus and confidence and over the next 12 to 24 months. We are deploying the full force of our operational and technical experience, including our sustainability leadership with a view to preserving and optimizing value for the long term. Turning now to rationalization. Our divestment program over the last 12 months has been a resounding success. We have sold or reached definitive agreements to sell all six of our non-core operations, as part of the program we announced last February, and we have the potential to deliver up to $4.3 billion in pretax proceeds from this divestment program, which is expected to result in around $2.5 billion in cash proceeds in the first half of this year after taxes and closing costs. Importantly, the transactions announced so far including Telfer, are also expected to remove approximately $1.8 billion in closure liabilities from our balance sheet. This rationalization work is now positioning Newmont with a core set of Tier 1 assets that we see as being capable of capitalizing on the gold and copper cycles for several decades. In Canada with our work to integrate and rationalized our portfolio. We've also been working to stabilize production. As a result, we were able to exceed our production guidance by delivering 6.8 million ounces of gold and over 150,000 tons of copper last year, of which around 85% was produced from our go-forward core portfolio. We generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow last year and record free cash flow for the fourth quarter of $1.6 billion, driven by strong gold prices, higher sales volumes and positive working capital movements. It is also worth pausing for a moment to acknowledge that our fourth quarter reflects the true financial performance potential that our go-forward core portfolio can achieve and the positive effect it can have on our all-in sustaining costs. Building on the three focus areas I've just covered, we've also continued to advance our capital allocation priorities in 2024. We returned $2.3 billion through regular dividends and share repurchases, demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. And we maintained a strong and flexible investment-grade balance sheet, ending the year with more than $3.6 billion in cash and $7.7 million in liquidity. In addition to shareholder returns over the last 12 months, we further improved our financial position by retiring $1.4 billion in debt, reaching our target balance of below $8 billion. As we move forward, we still have plenty of work ahead of us to capture the returns and margin potential we see possible from our go-forward portfolio. And while we do not speculate where gold prices are heading, we do continue to see robust demand and strong pricing given the geopolitical environment and gold's place as a long-term store of value, not only for individuals and professional investors, of the central banks as well. Turning to the next slide. As the world's leading gold producer, it is our responsibility to maximize the full value of the unique combination of our people, our assets, our projects and our culture to generate long-term shareholder value. With this in mind, combined with a clear line of sight of our go-forward portfolio, we are committed to making meaningful improvements to our safety, cost and productivity performance. The results of these efforts will drive stable and predictable production, allow us to better manage costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis to capture the incremental margins and cash flows we are seeing as a result of strong gold prices. And to explain where we are going, it's important to first appreciate where we are today. Newmont's high-quality portfolio is a great platform for investors to gain exposure to gold and copper fundamentals while benefiting from the improvements we are making to drive operational performance. Our portfolio includes more than half of the world's Tier 1 gold operations. We have the largest scale, longest life and highest quality combination of assets, with the capacity to perform for decades and through commodity cycles. Another key characteristic of our business is the quality of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This is an advantage that helps reduce some of the geopolitical risks inherent in our industry. So, with the right mix of assets, we now have a laser focus on safely improving costs and productivity at each of our managed operations so that our go-forward portfolio of Tier 1 assets operate, with a Tier 1 cost structure. Turning to the next slide. In our go-forward portfolio, we had 11 managed operations and three key projects in execution, strategically diversified across the world's most favorable mine jurisdictions. It is what we will deliver from this portfolio that will truly set us apart from our peers. Over the next decade, we expect that Newmont will produce roughly 6 million ounces of gold and around 150,000 tons of copper on average each year. The investment cycle that we are currently in, combined with the cost and productivity improvement we are doing will help us maximize our margins, not only in a strong gold market like we see today, but also future commodity cycles, enabling us to generate the highest possible margins. As is typical with large, long-life mines, there will naturally be some periods with lower production and some with higher production. But overall, this unique combination of assets sets us up to deliver robust and sustainable production for the foreseeable future. And underpinning this portfolio with more than 40 years of high confidence reserve and resources with decades of upside from mineral inventory and our ongoing exploration of endowment. As announced today, our gold reserve base assets are at 134 million ounces and is supported by 170 million ounces of gold resources. In addition to the largest gold reserve resource base in the industry, we also have significant copper reserves and resources, providing organic opportunities to further diversify into the future. Our gold reserves for 2024 we declared using a $1,700 an ounce gold price, which was increased from $1,400 an ounce. This increase was paid following our standard annual review process. It takes into consideration the three-year trailing average price, analyst forecast, and current economic conditions. With the long-life nature of our assets, combined with the maturity of our governance processes, we have full confidence that we will continue to develop optimal mine plans at these price assumptions. As demonstrated by no material reduction in the reserve gold grade due to the increased price. I'd also like to briefly note revisions we made to the reserves for two of our new assets, Lihir and Brucejack. These revisions were a result of applying Newmont governance and technical rigor and include appropriate updates to the final pit shell design of Lihir, as well as updates to the resource part of Brucejack to appropriately increase grade reliability. I'll now step through each of the large localized operations in our portfolio and the expectations for the year ahead, starting with Cadia. Cadia is one of Australia's largest gold copper mines and an industry leader in both block caving and automation. Block or panel caves cycle through natural periods of harvest and investment. When we assumed ownership, Cadia was just coming out of a harvest period phase, and Panel Cave-2 was beginning to ramp down from peak production. Today, we are transitioning to our next Panel Cave, PC2-3, building Panel Caves 1-2 and also catching up on a historical underinvestment in both tailings remediation and storage capacity. And as we progress this work, we are ensuring that we are optimizing capital intensity and the balance between tailing storage capacity and the mine and processing plant run rates. Moving to the next slide, I'll cover another of the new assets in our portfolio. At Lihir, the focus remains on creating stability in both the mine and processing plant by addressing the critical issues that we have identified in both systems. We've optimized the mine plan -- taking into consideration the significant cultural heritage site within the mine, the mine layout and sequence and equipment reliability to deliver a more sustainable long-term mine plans. We have also established a run-of-mine stockpile de-coupling the mine and processing plan and ensuring that we can deliver stable and quality feed to the mill where asset reliability is our key focus. This work will result in stable production in '25 through to 2027 as we move waste in the Phase 14a layback in order to access higher grades. This will then result in an estimated 30% lift in production in 2028 and beyond. Touching briefly on Brucejack. The underground development and drilling work to improve our knowledge of this nuggety ore-body and reduce grade variability is progressing very well. We're applying the lessons we learned a dozen years ago in Tanami with a similar ore body, by tightening our drilling density in order to improve the resource model and deliver steady and lasting value over the long term. Moving then to our legacy Newmont operations and starting with our large poly-metallic mine, Peñasquito. Following the successful stripping campaign in 2024, we will deliver higher gold grades for the Peñasco pit this year, resulting in a 30% increase in gold production compared to last year. 2026 will then see a higher proportion of silver lead and zinc content due to higher production for the Chile Colorado pit as per our normal mining sequence. At Boddington, our large gold and copper mine in Western Australia, the investment in stripping of planned laybacks in both the North and South pits, progresses well. Paving the way for higher grades to be accessed, 30% more gold to be delivered starting in 2027. At Ahafo complex, 2024 was a record production year in the 20-year life of our Ahafo South operation. This strong performance will continue through the first half of this year. At which stage the Subika open pit reaches the end of economic life, and we move across to mining lower grade ore from the Awonsu open pit, driving a slight reduction in production compared to the record levels of last year. This reduction will be partially offset by our new Ahafo North Mine, which comes online in the second half of this year, enabling the Ahafo complex to continue to contribute around 750,000 ounces per year in 2026 and beyond. At Tanami, we expect production will remain consistent in 2025, that will be weighted around 60% for the second half of the year, driven by the higher-grade stopes will access from both the Oron and Liberator ore bodies. We continue to advance the expansion project at Tanami, which will provide a meaningful reduction in operating costs and increased gold production by around 35% beginning in 2028. Finally, we expect that our production in 2025 will be further enhanced by around 1.4 million ounces of gold from our non-managed joint ventures. And in the medium term, our managing partner has indicated that they will deliver approximately 20% more gold in 2027 compared to last year. So, as we look beyond 2025, we expect to add more than 10% of annual gold production by 2028, as we bring forward the high-quality low-cost ounces from the laybacks and projects that I've just described. Turning to the next slide. The three key projects we currently have in execution advanced substantially in '24, and I have full confidence that we'll continue building on that momentum this year. Beginning with Ahafo North, we made a notable shift from land access and clearing activities in 2023 to the construction of the mine of processing infrastructure, progressing the highway diversion and commencing stripping last year. With this solid progress, we remain on track for our first gold in the second half and declare commercial production towards the end of this year. Turning to the second expansion at Tanami. We made really solid progress last year achieving two important milestones. We completed the concrete lining of the top 1.3 kilometers of this 1.5-kilometer-deep shaft pouring over 30,000 tons of concrete. And we successfully backfilled with concrete, the 160-meter section of over-break at the very bottom of the shaft, and it is now ready to be raised aboard. In 2025, our focus shifts to equipping the top 1.3 kilometer section with services once we raise for that bottom 160 meters in parallel. In conjunction with this critical path work, we'll also be progressing the construction of the underground crushing and materials handling infrastructure. along with the surface infrastructure. We continue to expect to declare commercial production in the second half of 2027 and significantly reduced operating costs in 2028, underpinning Tanami's future as a long-life, low-cost producer. Moving to the Panel Caves Cadia, which I touched upon earlier. We reached some important milestones last year. In Panel Caves 2-3, we achieved cave assessment and have now delivered more than 1 million tons of ore on this new cave to our processing plant. At Panel Cave 1-2, we completed more than 12 kilometers of underground development. Combined, these two caves are expected to deliver more than 5 million ounces of gold and 1 million tons of copper and will position Cadia to continue operating to the middle of this century. Turning now to the impact from our investment cycle and the current gold price dynamics on our costs. 2025 has already proven to be an exciting year for a variety of reasons. Current gold prices are at near record levels, surpassing $2,900 an ounce more than $500 higher than the price we realized in 2024. While higher gold prices contribute to our free cash flow generation, and we'll continue benefiting our shareholders. I also want to be very transparent about the impact of both our current investment cycle and higher gold prices have on our unit costs. All-in sustaining costs for our core portfolio are expected to be around $1,620 an ounce in 2025. This increase is a result of a variety of factors, that can be split in two major drivers. Higher sustaining capital investment and macroeconomic factors. First, we are estimating a $40 an ounce increase tied to the elevated sustaining capital spend at Cadia associated with the investment in both tailings remediation and storage capacity that I described earlier. Next, we are estimating a $35 an ounce increase of a higher proportion of the costs at our four poly-metallic mines being allocated to gold over other metals. This noncash impact to our gold all-in sustaining cost is due to the way we categorize co-product costs under U.S. GAAP and driven by the increase in our gold reserve price compared to our reserve prices for copper, silver, lead and zinc. Next, for 2025, we have assumed a $2,500 gold price. And for every $100 increase in gold price, we expect a $10 increase in our all-in sustaining costs due to taxes, royalties and profit-sharing payments. And finally, we are forecasting a $44 an ounce increase linked to a 3% assumption for inflation this year compared to 2024. We recognize that our all-in sustaining costs are not where we want them to be. So, in addition to the work, we are doing to bring on new low-cost ounces and normalize our sustaining capital spend over the next three years. My team and I are working to reduce costs and improve productivity across our go-forward managed portfolio. Over the last few years, Newmont has been on a journey to build the world's leading gold and copper company. And after doing the work to rationalize our portfolio, we are now firmly focused on improving costs and productivity across our entire organization. This is key to ensuring that our assets reliably and predictably generate the most profitable 6 million ounces of gold per year over the long term. The program behind this cost and productivity work has three key components. Our G&A costs are too high for our go-forward portfolio. We have a laser focus on ensuring that these costs are reduced, as we transitioned from 17 to 11 managed operations over the course of this year. Second, we are well into the process of evolving our commercial work at Newmont to ensure we have the capability to extract the full benefit of our scale, both in terms of our supply chain spend, as well as the revenue we received from doré and concentrate sales. Third, with the clarity of our go-forward portfolio, we are applying the full force of our operating and technical capability to systematically improve productivity across all 11 of our managed operations, whilst achieving the industry-leading safety record that we demand. And I will provide further updates on this program as we progress and move forward through this year. Bringing it all together, over last year, we have developed a much deeper understanding of our go-forward portfolio and the work ahead of us to deliver meaningful improvements, safety, costs and productivity this year. And while we progress this work, we are providing shorter-term and high confidence guidance for 2025. This year, we expect gold production from our go-forward Tier 1 portfolio to be around 5.6 million ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of $1,620 an ounce. Our sustaining capital is expected to be $1.8 billion and will remain at this level over the next couple of years as we complete our current investment cycle on the tailings storage facilities at Cadia. And we will continue to maintain discipline with our development capital spend, holding our investment to $1.3 billion for 2025. We expect the production from our core Tier 1 portfolio will be around 52% weighted to the second half of this year, driven mainly by the timing of production from our non-managed operations. Taking this trend into account in the first quarter we expect to deliver around 23% of the forecast gold production from our core portfolio. This will then be supplemented by around $250,000 higher cost ounces from our non-core assets held for divestment. Our unit costs will also be impacted by the timing of sustaining capital spend from both that managed and non-managed operational. And this is currently expected to be around 52% weighted to the first half of this year. So -- compared to the rest of the year, we anticipate that our all-in sustaining costs will be highest in the first quarter. As a consequence, we anticipate a notable decrease in our first quarter free cash flow compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect to generate sequentially higher free cash flow each quarter. And with the momentum, we'll be well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2025 whilst also funding our capital allocation priorities and building a stable future for Newmont. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is driven by three key priorities. First; we've maintained financial strength and flexibility with cash above $3 billion and debt below $8 billion; second, to steadily reinvest in our business with the goal of generating long-term sustainable free cash flow; and third, to return capital to shareholders through our predictable $1 a share annual dividend, and our share repurchase program. In order to maintain consistent cash levels through this year, the timing of share repurchases is likely to be closely correlated with our projected free cash flow, along with the timing of proceeds from our non-core asset divestments. After a period of integration, rationalization and stabilization, our focus is now on our go-forward portfolio. Last year, we focused on integrating four new assets, divesting our six non-core assets and laying the foundations to delivering cost productivity improvements of a safe, productive and profitable future. With 2024 now behind us, we moved to strengthen our value proposition by leveraging the true potential of our assets and projects to improve our safety, cost and productivity performance, positioning Newmont to focus on margins and growing free cash flow for the benefit of our shareholders. And with that, I thank you for your time today and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Hugo Nicolaci with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Hugo Nicolaci: Congrats on the strong finish in 2024 and thanks for all the color already so far in the presentation. First one maybe for Karyn. Just post the recent debt reduction and the divestments to come through, how should the market think about the gearing and debt targets going forward? I appreciate you've talked to the $8 billion of debt and $5 billion of net debt. But with gold prices and cash generation where it is and where you're seeing it going and the number of strong projects able to start to come into that growth pipeline? Do you think something like the leverage ratio might be more appropriate in terms of being able to then look at accelerating some of those growth projects?
Karyn Ovelmen: Right now -- thanks for the question, Hugo. Yes, right now, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. So, maintaining that strong balance sheet with around $3 billion in cash on average over the year, debt below the $8 billion, as you said, and steadily funding those cash-generative capital projects. We've got $1.8 billion sustaining capital that's at an elevated level for the next few years with the Cadia tailings and then $1.3 billion with development capital. And then, of course, returning capital to shareholders. So, $1 annual dividend, no change there. And then continuing with our share repurchases as part of that $3 billion program that we have. We've executed on $1.2 billion and we have $1.8 billion remaining on that authorization. So, no change to the financial policies.
Hugo Nicolaci: And then second one, maybe for both Tom and Natasha. Just looking beyond, the current growth projects to that next phase of growth. Are you able to give us a bit more on what's needed to firm up the sequencing and timing of projects like Red Chris and Yanacocha in the sulfides? And is it studies and permitting, just given where you've already got significant capital invested in those projects and when should we expect an update? And then just a tack on how many projects do you think is the right number to be progressing concurrently for the portfolio?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Hugo. Our focus is firmly on delivery, the three projects we've got in execution and a $1.3 billion spend for a portfolio of our size is a healthy amount of money to be investing back in the business. So delivering on those hitting commercial production improving the value from those projects is our firm focus hitting our milestones this year and then ensuring that they come through -- that earns the right to be able to bring anything more through your project pipeline. But we do have some exciting projects sitting there queuing up, looking to get access to that capital. Red Chris is -- we're working through its feasibility study this year. So, two at Newmont standard, ensuring that we have not only the technical work done as part of the feasibility study, but as you've got the permits and the and the support of the Tahltan for that very, very long life project. At Yanacocha, the potential at Yanacocha we've been -- at Peru 40 years at Yanacocha for -- mining for 30 years. We've produced 40 million ounces of gold out of Yanacocha -- is more -- we haven't even past halfway yet. So, a very long life in front of Yanacocha. But we're at an inflection point. We moved from oxide operations to sulfides and other deposits that sit there. The important piece of work for us to do now at Yanacocha is to build the water treatment plants to be able to capture the mine effect of border and discharge -- treat that and discharge safely, that then sets us up to be able to go to with its next chapter. We've got Wafi-Golpu in PNG that we continue to work with Harmony and the PNG government on. We've got Nueva Union and Norte Abierto down in Chile, and we continue to understand where they might fit. And we've got Galore Creek up in British Columbia. So, we continue to understand and work those projects first and foremost, Hugo is delivering on our projects. We've got an execution here and now, do that well, then we earn the right to bring on those next projects.
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Morgan with Barrenjoey. Your line is now open.
Daniel Morgan: Tom and team. First question, just I know you've increased your reserve price assumption to $1,700 an ounce. Your 2025 ounce standing cost guidance of $1,620. Sorry to say that just strikes -- a little bit odd. It's an $80 an ounce margin. Does that imply that the [indiscernible] [Cerberus] peak costs and they come down? Or it's -- can you just comment on that difference and how you set the reserve price assumption.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Daniel. When we look at it -- there are two separate things. Our process being many, many years at Newmont, the team that works through our annual process to assess reserve pricing is looking at price, looking at the three-year trailing average looking at forward estimates, and making a judgment on price as to where our reserve price should be and then how that informs the work we do within randomized, mine plans and the like. Now on the other side of the coin, separate from that, we look at what our unit costs have to be for '25. There are $1,620 for 2025 because we've got some pretty -- one of the main drivers is we've got some pretty significant investment going back into Cadia to ensure that we've fixed that tailings facility to ensure those caves are able to realize their value. So, we separate those two things. $1,620, not happy with that number. It needs to come down. Our go-forward portfolio was generally in Q1, and we need to get our cost base down to Tier 1 levels. We need to get after -- we need to get through this investment cycle to bring on those cost ounces, but we also need to improve our cost and productivity. But they are two separate strengths. We set our pricing through reserve price over here. through a rigorous process that's conducted every year. We manage our costs this year, and we need to get up to improving those costs going forward.
Daniel Morgan: Separate question, Lihir. I know you've done a reserve update. You've done some optimization on the pits. Just curious, how much closer is your attempt to concluding what the go-forward plan is at that asset? I imagine they would also be a reinvestment plan to upgrade asset integrity and set it up well into the future. So, when might that be concluded and when might you share that with us?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. So, as you commented on the -- we've now done a Newmont standard final pit shell, which impacted the reserves. The other important work we did was to step out from layer rock to ensure that we had appropriate offset from that rock. And then how we set up that high wall to manage that Phase 14a layback. So, we've done that mine planning work. Now it's about making sure that the roads are in good nick and then maintained, so that we can manage the equipment integrity, the trucks and diggers and other ancillary equipment running around that mine and work through that stripping campaign over the next two or three years, so we can move into the higher-grade ore from that Phase 14a layback. So that work is underway. Then setting up the skyway and having the wrong stockpile separate mine and processing plant now allows us to get greater reliability and quality of the feed going into the into the plant, which admittedly gives you greater confidence through the plant. And that then allows us to have more structure around our corrective and preventative maintenance program through that plan, which is part of the sustaining capital budget you have for a mine of that size. So those pieces are in place, and team is now getting after that. They know what they need to do. We need to deliver on what we said we're going to do this year, as indicated in my remarks, that as we work through that layback get into the 2028 period and Lihir will return to the historical levels that you've seen. And our plan is to maintain that into the future. So, we've got two or three years of getting that work done. And then Lihir is a long-term asset in the Newmont portfolio. I mean it's got the reserves and resources to a Newmont standard, north of 30 million ounces. It is by any measure of world-class asset. We're setting it up right over the next two or three years to deliver on the value, it's been looking for the last 30 years. Very pleased that it is in our portfolio.
Operator: The next question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Lawson Winder: Thank you for the update. I just wanted to ask your thinking around the provision of one-year guidance. And so, I understood that you would consider maybe doing three years. And then as you look forward, is one year guidance what you anticipate continuing going forward? Or could we get back to potentially longer-term guidance?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. Massive transformation last year. I mean -- I'm 35 years in the industry. Worked in many different places, been fortunate enough to be involved in many transactions I haven't seen much more complicated than the work we've run through successfully last year in terms of being assets divestment program and coming out the other side. What's most important for us now is stabilizing this business, and focusing on a high confidence set of confidence in our guidance that we can get after and safely deliver. So, our focus is not stabilizing the business in '25 and delivering on those numbers that we've committed to in our release today. As part of that work, we're getting after cost and productivity improvements and understanding what the potential is of this go-forward portfolio and had it for a midnight, a New York minute rather. I've only had it for a second, how do we actually understand what the true potential of this portfolio has? We're getting after that this year. We're going to take all of this year to understand that asset -- that portfolio of assets and build a plan for '26. And so, our focus is on '25, delivering on our commitments and understanding what these assets might do as we work with them through the course of this year.
Lawson Winder: Fantastic. Now just a follow-up on the R&R gold price assumption of $1,700. You've kind of indicated that, that was how you're thinking about the business at least for 2025. And -- in the past, you've thought about the dividend with respect to gold price ranges as well. So previously, the $1,400 represented the base level dividend. When we think about the current dividend as it was reset last year, is $1,700 per ounce, the gold price at which that is sustainable? Or is that still a $1,400?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. A decoupled, our dividend, our common dividend is $1 a share, full stop.
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Your line is now open.
Daniel Major: The first one, and maybe another theme on the three-year guidance. You you're suggesting a 10-year average of 6 million ounces. But when we look at the portfolio and the projects that you've run through and the grade profile at Boddington, et cetera, and the guidance from Barrick would suggest on the consensus and on kind of our numbers, you would be above that towards the end of the sort of three- to five-year period. Is that the wrong assumption? Are we missing something in the portfolio that would go backwards to prevent you getting above 6 million ounces on a three-year view?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Daniel. You're seeing it correctly as we work through bringing on those -- both through those laybacks and bring on the new low-cost ounces. I think the comments I said 10% higher over that time frame. That will -- of what we've guided for our core portfolio over '25, and we'll certainly push you through and out the other side of '26. Now roll forward, another three, another four, another five, this portfolio goes out decades. And they're big mines, and you'll move through periods of lower grade, you move through periods of were stripping. So, if you will ebb and flow. So, you'll have some years where you're above six -- you'll have some years we're below six. If you get in the time machine and move forward 5, 10, 15 years, I look back at this Newmont portfolio, you're going to see on average about 6 million ounces of gold at 150,000 tons of copper. You're going to see a management team here that's going to focus on improving the margins in that not chasing volume. We're chasing margin. That's what we're going to be focusing on. But we will ebb and flow through the course of that very long-life portfolio. Dan, you haven't seen this before in the gold industry. This portfolio is like the likes of which has not been seen before.
Daniel Major: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is around the trajectory of your -- overhead costs to G&A, they've come up a lot, and they're going up even more in 2025, and that comes against you executing on significant synergies as a consequence of the new Newcrest deal. Why are they so high in 2025? My feeling would be that a lot of the costs associated with the divestments and the integration would be done but the G&A is going up further, what's the explanation? And how much might moderate in the medium term?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Daniel. Good call out. The -- we did see the -- we did see the G&A synergies that come from a transaction like the Newcrest acquisition, where you collapse two public companies into one. So that element that comes out. But you're still seeing us carry unacceptably high G&A as we work through the divestment and the rationalization of our portfolio. So, we're still -- we've closed out Telfer late last year, but we're still carrying five assets that are held for divestment, and that will work through closing out those transactions through this quarter and into next. And we're still doing work around integrating systems from bringing two companies together that carries out an elevated cost for a fixed period of time. The number we're guiding to is an unacceptably high number for our go-forward portfolio. And as we see the assets leave our portfolio, I expect -- you should expect to see a glide path of the G&A cost coming down to match a go-forward portfolio of 11 managed operations. So, we guide to the number we have because of the work we're doing. But we're getting after reducing those -- the G&A cost down to a level that is more acceptable for our go-forward portfolio.
Operator: The next question is from Kate McCutcheon with Citi. Your line is now open.
Kate McCutcheon: Just on the Newcrest integration. So last quarter, you reiterated the 5-million-pound synergy run rate had been achieved. But I can't see that in the 4Q release that I may have missed it. Can you just call out for me where I see these numbers in the financials? If I look, it seems like OpEx and expenses both look higher, not lower. So just trying to reconcile the synergies and where that maybe lives?
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. Thanks, Kate. Thanks for the question. So, as we went through 2024, we had a run rate expectation coming out of 2024 -- the synergies, and we hit that run rate at the end of the year at a much-accelerated pace than we had thought we would. So, you'll see these synergies. And although again, G&A, although it's high, because we got a lot of onetime costs in there as well as additional functional spend and consulting spend associated with some of the efficiency and productivity initiatives that you're seeing that we will see the benefit in future years. So, those were -- had the synergies in there, but the cost of the accelerated cost overwhelmed those synergies that were in G&A. The supply chain, we did see the synergies. We captured those approximately $200 million during again, the was a run rate at the end of 2025 and then as well as for a productivity improvement -- potential across the board around $200 million in synergies. All of those -- you don't necessarily see in the bottom line as we know our cost were elevated through 2024 and into 2025. And that's where Tom was speaking in his prepared notes, we have to get after those costs. So, we saw an acceleration in the cost. Again, some of that is a result of how we're looking at in terms of gold price escalation, normal escalation that you see year-over-year. But generally speaking, we had an overall increase in our cost structure, both in direct costs as well in G&A. And as a result, you don't see those synergies on a net basis in our bottom line.
Kate McCutcheon: Got it. And then on capital allocation, asset sales and free cash flow this quarter exceeded consensus expectations. You've got another $1.8 billion authorized under the buyback. It doesn't really look like much stock was repurchased over the past quarter -- yet the share price was not a lot higher, very certainly. It was not at a high. How do we think about the cadence of that buyback throughout the year?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sure. So, we ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of buybacks. But at 12/31, our 1051 -- the expiration of the 10b5-1. So, as you see in the beginning of 2025, there was just some -- effective settlements of some of those buybacks from 2024. So really no share buyback since the beginning of 2025, post the earnings release, we will be in a position where we can begin to execute on share buybacks as we go forward. The timing of those share buybacks that will be closely correlated with the free cash flow generation and the timing of the proceeds from the non-core divestitures. So right now, we're expecting net of cash around $2.5 billion in divestiture proceeds, about $1.6 billion in Q1 and $0.9 billion% in Q2. So, all expected in the first half of 2025.
Operator: The next question is from Josh Wolfson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Josh Wolfson: I just wanted to go back to this discussion about some of the long-term expectations. I appreciate the disclosures earlier in the call, on changes over '26 and '27, but maybe back to some of the comments by Lawson and Daniel. I feel personally like we don't have a lot of information here on the long term or even the short-term outlook beyond 2025 for the Company. And there's a large difference in this release versus what the Company has issued previously. Should we expect to receive any substantive information beyond one year in future releases maybe in 2026?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Josh, very deliberate this year, Josh, I should say, very deliberate after a year of transformation and to move our stabilization to firmly focus this organization on delivering on commitments, safely delivering on commitments in 2025 with high confidence guidance. That's our focus for delivering on safety costs and productivity and the projects. And I think we signaled back well over the last many weeks and months, and that's what we're going to be doing with this release. And we've given you through the release and the comments today, a view as to how the investments and the laybacks and the investments in those three projects and execution will play out over the next three or four years. We're going to take every part of 2025 to get after cost of productivity improvements in our go-forward portfolio and understand where we might be able to take this essentially new portfolio for us and build that into a '26 business plan and will come out this time next year, with a set of numbers for 2026 that we'll commit to with high confidence. And we'll make some decisions through the course of this year as to whether it's 2026 only or whether based on the work we do this year whether we give a bit more color for years two or three. But that work is in front of us, Josh, and we've headed out to getting into it.
Josh Wolfson: Understood. Maybe with that level of disclosure in our minds, how should investors and analysts assess the success of the Newcrest acquisition, given the impact of production and costs so far as well as reserves and not a lot of perspective as to what the assets look like longer term?
Tom Palmer: So, Josh, I would look through the work we're doing this year to look at what we're doing to configure and fix Cadia for decades. We're building two caves, PC 2-3, PC 1-2 and we are considering whether PC 1-2 extends to pick up PC 1-3. You build those caves. You'll be able to support tailings capacity and you've got decades of ore coming out of that mine. You've got to Lihir with a resource base of some 36 million ounces -- and we're setting up that mine to deliver on that long-term value. You've got Red Chris that we're doing the feasibility study on a magnificent underground mine with a huge endowment. And you've got Brucejack as we get the resource model to the Newmont standard, very long life. So, we're doing the work this year to ensure that those assets can figure to deliver on their long-term potential, and we'll share stories on our progress as we go through each quarter. Another way of answering your question is to look at the fourth quarter on the record free cash flow we generated. That's an insight into what the go-forward portfolio can do. As we get into it, fix it up, position, to make sure every asset understands what it needs to do, and we get after it. So that's another little signal as to what is put to strength of this portfolio.
Operator: The last question for today is from the line of Al Harvey with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Al Harvey: Just wanting to follow up on projects again. I suppose usually you have three executions at once. So, I think afoot kind of coming towards the end -- by the end of the year. So, I guess I just wanted to get a sense of whether or not we can expect a fairly rapid transit into the next project. And I suppose I want to get your thinking on which projects the most logical step kind of assume it's Red Chris if you've got the study to come later this year. But, yes, is that the most likely candidate? Or is there a chance to hold fire on FID-ing that project?
Tom Palmer: I think it's important that we just don't have a conveyor belt of projects. We got to watch their phase. And sort of the fact we have three projects in execution, we want to make sure you hit commercial production, you still going to ramp -- half make sure it's delivering on the value we committed. So that takes you a good chunk in the 2026 to get that done. You've got to watch to phase of your project execution -- is you need to manage, and you've got to make bloody sure, you've got a feasibility study that's well understood and it's got to deliver good returns. So doing the feasibility study for Red Chris at the moment. And there's a number of moving parts, not just the technical piece to make sure you got in place. But I would say, as we think about next cab off the rank at Newmont, when we're ready, if the value is there, it's just Red Chris ought to lose.
Al Harvey: Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up, I suppose. Just beyond those next projects. I know your comments earlier about the copper options in the portfolio. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about where you might be more inclined to invest on the gold side of the copper side?
Tom Palmer: So, I think about copper, two big laybacks north and south pit at Boddington, we're going to swing back into high grade, that's golden-copper. We got some nice copper coming back there. PC 2-3 it becomes the main supplier of ore at Cadia. It's some nice copper coming back up through there. Move across to Red Chris, and that's the one sort of links to you earlier in the previous question. That's the one if it wins the race and it washes its face. That's as much a copper mine as a gold mine. So, it's the one that can give us not only the pathway to maintain that 150,000 ounces over the long term I talked about, but maybe even push through that.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for making the time for the call today, and look forward to seeing or speaking to you soon. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-24 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Thomas Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Before we discuss our third quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to remember Antoine Fortin, who tragically lost his life at our Illinois operation late last month. We recognize that this is our fifth fatality in less than a year, and we are working diligently to strengthen and improve our safety systems along with the key safety tools that we use in the field. We are fully-committed to understanding the factors that contributed to this tragedy and are taking decisive action to improve our safety culture. We've a clear focus on effectively controlling all of the risks that could lead to a fatality. We will also continue to transparently share the lessons we learn from the investigation with our peers in the industry to help to improve the safety performance of our sector. At Newmont, we know that a strong safety culture is fundamental to sustainably delivering on our commitments, and it is our accountability to ensure that, everyone working at Newmont returns home safely after each and every shift. Turning now to a summary of our third quarter. I'm honored to have recently been appointed as the next Chair of the International Council of Mining and Metals or ICMM. We look forward to playing an even greater role in advancing sustainability and responsible mining practices both at Newmont and across our industry. During my term as Chair, one of my key priorities will be building support for the consolidated mining standard initiatives, an effort we have strongly supported and actively engaged in over the last few months. These consolidated standards will be essential for strengthening the industry's reputation and providing stakeholders with confidence, that the commodities we produce are mined responsibly. Last week, we announced that, we have partnered with MKS PAMP to launch our first mined to market traceable gold bar for sale in the United States, making Newmont's gold directly accessible to consumers and demonstrating our commitment through transparent sourcing. Shifting to our world-class portfolio of Tier 1 and emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. In the third quarter, we produced nearly 1.7 million ounces of gold and 430,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Notably, this included 37,000 tons of copper. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and $760 million in free cash flow. Our non-core divestment program has advanced meaningfully, since our last earnings call with the two recently announced transactions expected to deliver up to $1.5 billion in combined gross proceeds. The first announcement was a definitive agreement to divest the Telfer mine, and our 70% interest in the Havieron project in Western Australia, the total proceeds of up to $475 million. We continue to progress the closing conditions and expect to complete the transaction this quarter. The second announcement was a definitive agreement to sell the Akyem mine in Ghana for up to $1 billion in cash consideration. We also expect to close this transaction towards the end of the year. With this solid progress, we remain firmly on track to realize our commitment to generate at least $2 billion in gross proceeds from the divestment of our non-core assets. It is also important to note that, this is in addition to the $527 million in cash proceeds that we have already received this year for the Lundin Gold, Batu Hijau transactions. Our divestment progress and strong free cash flow generation have positioned us to be able to continue reducing debt and returning capital to shareholders. Since our last earnings call, we have retired $233 million in debt and returned $786 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We also approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program bringing our total authorization to $3 billion. In addition, we continue to safely advance the three projects we have in execution. The second expansion at Tanami, our new mine at Ahafo North and the Panel Ks at Cadia. Finally, turning to synergies. When we announced our decision to acquire Newcrest, we committed to delivering $5 million in synergies from three areas G&A, supply chain and our full potential program. As of today, we have achieved that $500 million synergy run rate. Starting with G&A, a $100 million synergy run rate was achieved through labor rationalization and reductions in both insurance costs and contractor spend. Moving to supply chain, our team has been leveraging the scale of our combined company to achieve improved commercial outcomes that have already brought our synergy run rate from this area to $200 million. And finally, we've begun to realize significant value from our full potential program and are in the delivery stage of our initiatives at Cadia, Red Chris and Lihir. From this work, we have successfully surpassed a $200 million synergy run rate with potential upside to be realized in future years. The majority of the value realized so far has been attributed to Cadia due to the work we've been doing to more efficiently move stockpile material and to optimize the output from our high pressure grinding roll system in the mill, an initiative that I touched on last quarter. The remaining value has come from Red Chris and Lihir. At Red Chris, we're improving gold and copper recoveries from the optimization of both the grinding and flotation circuits, while also increasing throughput by delivering a more consistent ore feed to the mill. And at Lihir, we are focused on improving efficiency by debottlenecking the materials handling and crushing circuits, as we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call. With our synergy commitment now met and our divestment program will advance, we are now focused on the sustainable value that we will deliver from our go forward portfolio of 11 managed large, long-life operations. With that, I'll now turn it over to Natascha for an operational update and then to Karen to take us through our financial performance for the quarter. Over to you, Natascha.
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom. As we enter the final quarter of 2024, I'd like to start by re-emphasizing the operational priorities I highlighted at the beginning of the year. Our focus remains on three key objectives. First is making sure that, every person walking through a Newmont site is fully equipped and authorized to do their work safely. Second, is continuing to deliver strong performance from our managed assets, whilst also guiding our non-core assets through a respectful and productive process for divestment. And last is enhancing long-term productivity at every one of our 11 managed Tier 1 and emerging Tier 1 operations. Turning to the next slide and let's begin with an operational overview. In the third quarter, our managed portfolio delivered a meaningful step-up in production as planned, producing 4% more gold than the second quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to the year with an anticipated 1.8 million ounces of gold in the fourth quarter or an approximately 8% increase over the third quarter. This performance has been largely driven by our six managed Tier 1 operations, which I now will touch on in more detail. I will start with Tanami. We began accessing higher grades from the Liberator orebody and remain on track to deliver this year's strongest grades in the fourth quarter. At Boddington, we continue stripping in the north and south bits, as planned which is expected to continue through 2025 and will bring forward strong gold and copper grades starting in 2026. Moving to Penasquito. We delivered steady gold, silver, lead and zinc production in the third quarter from the Chile, Colorado pit and commenced mining ore in the higher gold grade Penasquito well ahead of plan due to efficient stripping. This will result in an increase in gold production in the fourth quarter and into 2025. And importantly, we have signed a new collective bargaining agreement with the union at Pinusquito, which safeguards the rights of all workers and provides a solid foundation for operations at Pinusquito through 2026. Turning now to Cadia. As factored in our guidance, grades at Cadia are expected to continue declining in the fourth quarter, as we transition to and ramp up Panel Cave 2-3. We are progressing integrated studies to align cave development with life of mine tailings capacity, setting up Cadia for the next three decades of ore feed. Our focus for tailings is maximizing capacity in the current in pit storage facility, repairing the southern wall of the northern facility that slumped in 2018 and then raising the wall of the southern facility. These efforts are expected to contribute to a period of increased sustaining capital spend at Cadia over the next few years, as we make the necessary, but disciplined investment to remedy and expand the current timing facilities. At Lihir, we continue to progress the planned shutdown of the primary autoclave, which remains on track to deliver an approximate 50% step-up in gold production in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter. As we look ahead to 2025, our operational focus at Lahir will remain on reducing complexity to deliver more sustainable and predictable results at this Tier 1 operation. In the short-term, these efforts will result in lower than initially anticipated production next year, due to lower throughput to allow for asset reliability improvement work and changes to the mine sequencing, including the establishment of wider ramps to manage surface water and repositioning all roads to be more effective and efficient. Whilst we complete this work, we will be processing a higher proportion of lower grade stockpiles in 2025, and we anticipate that, gold production next year from Lihir will be largely consistent with this year's and around 250,000 ounces lower than our initial guidance for 2025 that we provided back in February. Importantly, this work will simplify and improve operations at Lihir for the long-term, establishing it as a more consistent contributor as one of the 11 managed operations in our go forward portfolio. Similarly, at Brucejack, we have taken a step back this year to do the development and drilling work to ensure that we improve our knowledge of this nuggety ore body. We continue to experience periods of exceptional high grades, including a one day average of 52 grams per tonne last month, and an average of over 20 grams per ton in the same week. As a result of the work we are doing, we anticipate that the gold production next year from Brucejack will also be largely consistent with this year, or around 100,000 ounces lower than our initial guidance for 2025 that we provided back in February. Moving to Ahafo South. In the third quarter, we achieved a significant increase in gold production of nearly 15% over the second quarter, driven by higher mill throughput following the successful girth gear replacement in April and strong grades from our Subika open pit and underground mines. Looking ahead, we expect our Ahafo South to maintain consistent production levels in the fourth quarter and into next year, before declining in the second half of 2025 when we complete mining activities at the Subika open pit as planned. And finally, during the fourth quarter, we expect to commence mining activities at our Harford North and will stockpile ore to be used to commission the mole next year. This will be an essential milestone for our African business unit as Akyem is divested and production is replaced with new low cost ounces from Ahafo North towards the end of 2025. Continuing with Ahafo North, we have made notable shift from land clearing and earthworks to constructing the infrastructure for this new mine. The carbon in leach tanks are complete and we continue constructing the crushing, conveying and more infrastructure, which you can see in the photo in our presentation. We've recently completed the lining of the timing storage facility and are establishing the ore roads to begin stripping at this new mine in the fourth quarter. At the second expansion at Tanami, our focus remains on the concrete lining of the shaft, and we have completed more than a kilometer of this 1.5 kilometer deep production shaft. As you can see in the photo, the winder building is now largely complete and we are preparing to install the wasting machinery, which will be used to raise and lower our people, equipment and ore within the mine shaft once complete. Our Cadia Panel Caves project is progressing well. At Panel Caves 2-3 we have achieved cave establishment, meaning that, the intended fracturing has begun and gravity is now playing an important role in the mining process. This is a significant milestone for this multi-year project and we are successfully processing gold and copper ore from this cave. Over the next decade, Panel Cave 2-3 is expected to deliver a million ounces of gold and more than 400,000 tons of copper and is anticipated to ramp up to an average of 400,000 gold equivalent ounces between 2027 and 2032. At Panel Cave 1-2, we continue to advance underground development and the construction of the materials handling system. As a much larger cave, Panel Cave 1-2 is expected to deliver nearly 4 million ounces of gold and more than 700,000 tons of copper over its 15 year cave life. It is anticipated to ramp up to an average of 525,000 gold equivalent ounces between 2030 and 2040. With that, I'll turn it over to Karyn.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Natascha. Turning to the next slide, I'll begin with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. Building upon Tom and Natascha's remarks, Newmont delivered strong third quarter results. We've reported adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, driven by sustained gold prices and strong quarterly production. We recorded adjusted net income of $0.81 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 compared to the second quarter. We also generated $1.6 billion cash flow from operations and $760 million of free cash flow, which does not include the approximately $300 million in cash payments received during the third quarter from the sale of the Lundin Gold financing facilities and Batu Hijau contingent payments announced earlier this year. Free cash flow for the quarter includes $209 million of unfavorable working capital changes, largely due to a build in stockpiles of $202 million mainly at Lihir and Telfer and $107 million of reclamation spend primarily related to the construction of the Yanacocha water treatment facilities. With $273 million in reclamation spent to-date, we anticipate an approximate $225 million to be spent next quarter. These unfavorable working capital changes were partially offset by the favorable timing of accrued liability payments. Looking ahead, we expect to reach the year's strongest production volumes in the fourth quarter, positioning us to deliver strong free cash flows and to continue returning capital to shareholders. As Tom mentioned, the divestitures announced to-date from our non-core portfolio are expected to generate up to $1.5 billion in gross proceeds on top of the nearly $530 million in cash proceeds received from other investment sales in 2024. And as we committed to earlier this year, we have been using the proceeds to create long-term value for our shareholders by strengthening our balance sheet and repurchasing shares. Since our last earnings call, we repurchased 9.4 million shares at an average price of $53.16 per share for a total cost of $500 million including $198 million repurchased during the third quarter and $302 million in October. And with $250 million remaining in the current program, Newmont's Board authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program to be executed over the next 24 months, bringing our total authorization to $3 billion. To-date, we've now completed $750 million of our $3 billion authorization. Additionally, we declared a fixed common third quarter dividend $0.25 per share, consistent with the dividend declared for the past three quarters. We purchased $233 million in nominal debt for $210 million for around $0.90 on a dollar, of which $150 million was purchased during the third quarter and $83 million was purchased in October. To-date, we've now retired nearly $500 million for the year. We maintained an investment grade balance sheet and ended the quarter $7.1 billion in total liquidity. And our gross debt now stands at $8.5 billion compared to our target of $8 billion. In line with our balanced capital allocation strategy, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding value-accretive capital projects and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect approximately 1.8 million ounces of gold production in the fourth quarter as planned. Production from our managed Tier 1 assets continues to drive our strong operational performance and we remain on track to meet our full year production guidance. As signaled by our joint venture partner, production from Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo is expected to significantly increase in the fourth quarter, which is crucial as these sites comprise just over 20% of our attributable gold production for 2024. All in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately $14.75 an ounce, which represents an 8% reduction compared to the third quarter. This favorable decline is expected to be driven by higher gold production volumes and will be slightly offset by higher sustaining capital reinvestment, primarily anticipated at Nevada Gold Mines based on the run rate through the third quarter, and Cadia to remedy and expand the current tailings facilities as Natascha described. Increased production taxes and royalties from a higher gold price environment and slightly higher G&A spend largely due to an increase in contracted labor. Turning to development capital. We expect to spend $320 million during the fourth quarter, keeping us on track to meet our full year guidance estimates for earlier this year. We continue to expect to invest an average of $1.3 billion per year into projects that will generate the highest returns. With that, I'll pass it back to Tom for closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. We remain confident in the long-term strength of the go forward portfolio we have assembled, and continue to make solid progress on the four key commitments we made at the start of the year to our shareholders. Since our last earnings call, we continue to diligently implement the lessons learned from our recent fatalities, and are working to strengthen and improve our safety and risk management systems. We delivered high production as planned keeping us firmly on track to meet our full year production guidance. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and $760 million in free cash flow. We've made meaningful progress on our portfolio rationalization with the announced divestments of Telfer, Havieron and Akyem. We achieved our synergy run rate target of $500 million. We've demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns delivering $786 million from both regular dividends and share repurchases. We strengthened our balance sheet with $233 million of debt reductions, and we approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total authorization to $3 billion. Having now gained almost a year of experience working with our new operations, we have developed a much deeper understanding of their long-term contribution to our core portfolio and the work needed to create consistent and lasting value for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect gold production from our go forward Tier 1 portfolio to remain largely consistent with this year, driven by the lower than previously expected production from two of our new operations in Lahir and Brucejack. We expect unit cost from our core portfolio in 2025 to align with the trends we are observing this year. We also remain committed to the critical tailings work in Cadia, which may result in an annual sustaining capital spend of around $1.8 billion from our core portfolio over the next few years. We continue to see higher previously expected direct costs and G&A spend that with the clarity of our go forward portfolio, we are now working to manage. With this context, my leadership team and I have a laser focus on the work we need to do to optimize our go forward portfolio of 11 managed operations and three projects in execution. Whilst we do anticipate production growth over time, our focus is firmly on expanding margins, generating a strong return on capital invested and creating value versus chasing volume. We are taking a critical look at our organic project pipeline and spending time to ensure that any reinvestment we make into our portfolio is both disciplined and deliberate. We are applying an economic lens to the long term decisions we are making today, ensuring that we deliver on Newmont's purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable responsible mining for decades to come. With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Major at UBS. Daniel, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Daniel Major: Hello. Can you hear me okay?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Loud and clear. Thanks, Dan. Tom here.
Daniel Major: Great. Thanks. Yes, sort of two parts to the question. But I mean the first one is perhaps a kind of reflection on the industry as well. But, when I look back to February and you look at your cost profile in medium-term, like many in the gold industry, you've got costs coming down over time over the next few years. Yet this year, yes, all-in sustaining cost $100 higher than you saw in February. Is it realistic and credible to actually assume that unit costs will moderate over time, or should we rather be assuming the best case outcome is limiting inflation?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Dan. I'll kick that off and Karyn might want to jump in as well. Certainly, if I think about the gold industry, there's always been a strong correlation between gold price and the cost of producing ounce of gold, given that inflation is one of those key structural elements behind the gold price. As you look forward, if gold price eases, then you'd expect the cost of producing amounts to ease. Obviously, you see some tracking between the cost per ounce and the gold price. Our focus is on the on what we're putting in place is that, we have 11 managed operations going forward, where we're going to be in a position to be looking over the long-term and strengthening and growing those margins. The other comment I'd like before I pass to Karyn, if you wanted to build on that, is, when you look at the out year numbers that we had provided back in February that assumed zero escalation. And so, when you think about any forward-looking numbers, there's no escalation. Obviously, what we're seeing as we get closer to 2025, the run rates we're seeing as we close out this year are largely going to flow into next year, as we understand the cost for the next 12 to 15 months. Karyn, anything you'd do with that?
Karyn Ovelmen: No, I think that's right, Tom. It's just to emphasize those out years, as you mentioned, don't have an escalation in those. Generally speaking, as we indicated the costs that we're seeing here in 2024, we do expect those to trend into 2025. Costs were higher, driven by higher direct costs primarily, if you think about contracted labor which is 50% of our cost structure. We've seen those increase into the third quarter and through the year. And so we expect that that's been built in now into our cost estimates as we head into 2025.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. David, did you say, you have second part to your question?
Daniel Major: Yes. I had a second part, if that's, okay. Again, just thinking about your guidance comments for 2025. You previously looked in February around 6 million ounces from the core portfolio in terms of gold. You highlight in the comments 250,000 ounces lower than your previous plans at Lihir and 100 at Brucejack. Is it fair to then assume 350,000 off the 6 million is the new base when we look into 2025?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Certainly, there are two movers in terms of our managed portfolio. As I think as Natascha said in her remarks, I followed up with the drivers behind that might take considerably Lihir and getting in front of understanding the resource definition of Brucejack and the development work and the drilling you need to do for that all. Both of those are progressing well, but it's the ounces for next year reflect that important work. I think the numbers, if you then look at the rest of the portfolio and those trends coming through from 2024 flowing into 2025, the numbers more like 5.6 as you think about this portfolio for 2025, the core portfolio for 2025. Obviously, we've got some divestments to close-out and still got some more work to do on that front. Some of that will flow into 2025, as we complete that divestment work with our core portfolio. 5.6% is about their gold production number for next year.
Daniel Major: Okay. Yes, it's sort of broadly flat production and costs into next year is the message. Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Dan. That's correct.
Operator: Next question comes from Josh Wolfson from RBC Capital Markets. Josh, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Josh Wolfson: Hi. Thanks very much. I'm trying to wrap my head around the change, the significant change in sort of cost expectations and some degree production expectations going forward versus what we had been hearing about previously. I guess there's sort of two different aspects at least that I can understand. One is, despite the synergy targets being achieved, it sounds like, there's some larger integration issues given the challenges or higher costs mentioned across Brucejack, Lihir and Cadia. And then, on the other hand, we're hearing significant and unexpected inflation expectation changes, which I guess would be a larger industry-related item. I just want to sort of clarify, how should we be thinking about these things? And am I sort of assessing this appropriately? Thank you.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Justin. Let me kick off and I think Karyn, you might want to jump in. I think picking up in a few parts. I think the commentary around Lihir, Cadia, Cerro Negro, I think you mentioned is really the Q3 cost story. It's around Lihir, we had some costs that we had assumed would be in the fourth quarter for the launch, autoclave shutdown specialist labor in the remote part of the world moving into Q3. So that's one of the drivers there. Cadia was power, where high power cost coming off our contract for price taker. Cerro Negro was more around the ramping up following the tragedy earlier this year and making sure we're focused on doing that work safely, some productivity impacts. And then the other factor in the third quarter was we had some concentrate sales out of Penasquito where, didn't get away at the end of Q3 due to some weather impacts there that obviously flowed into the fourth quarter. So, that's sort of a bit of a wrap up of the third quarter cost story. When I look at '24 flying into '25, so there's two impacts as the volume impact we just talked about with Dan and the Lihir and Brucejack work next year linked to that. And then the cost impact is sustaining capital and particularly around the work we're putting into the facilities at Cadia. Cadia has got a 30 plus year life, several panel case will come on and there's work we need to do to ensure that, that targeted capacity is matched to the volumes coming out of those panel caves. That story is around volume for those couple of key drivers and then sustaining capital. Karyn or Natascha anything you'd be willing to add to that?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sure. Just to a little more granularity in terms of 2024. About a third of that is increased due to that lower sales volume including in Telfer, and here in Brucejack. Another third relates to that higher sustaining capital that we've been talking about largely driven by Nevada. And then the remaining third half that is about royalties due to higher gold price and half associated with the G&A. So our run rate synergies are driven by the targeted benefits at Cadia, Red Chris and Lihir. However, we've also had performance challenges within the business including the Telfer tailings as well as the non-management of underperformed expectations. I think further to that supply chain and G&A benefits have been impacted by our need to invest in the future of this combined Tier 1 portfolio with a key focus in areas with the integration from Newcrest and Newmont as needed. But we're not happy with where we're at and we're working to reduce these costs.
Josh Wolfson: Thanks, Ken. And if I can add, sir, to the follow-up question. Just sort of understanding if there's a quantum that can be provided in terms of maybe what the inflation trend is, the company is seeing, something that we can think about for modeling forecasts on operating costs or capital costs? Is there sort of any initial impressions you have on what inflation rates are running at currently?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Josh, we're seeing in terms of input costs around renewables, fuel, materials, that's largely in line with what the world is seeing. There's nothing particularly surprising for us there. It's the labor cost where we're seeing that escalation, particularly the contracted labor. We were seeing some of those escalations come through and then incorporating that in our in the sort of commentary or the steer we're giving for what flows into next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Matthew Murphy from Jefferies. Matthew, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matthew Murphy: Hi. I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little more on what this outlook for 2025 means going forward in terms of, those initial graphical kind of indications, you'd put out had production growing over 6,000,000 ounces, costs falling to, call it, the mid 1200s an ounce. I mean, should we be thinking about 2025 continuing, in 2026, and beyond? Is this a 5.5 million ounce a year, 1500 AISC type company that we're going to see going forward?
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, Matt. I think if I look at costs, you're certainly going to -- in the outlook given in February, there was no escalation there. As you make assumptions about what escalation inflation might do linked to what gold price might do and there's a key link between gold producers and gold price, then that's going to be a pretty significant driver of the cost of producing an ounce of gold at Newmont and any other the other gold mining companies. So that's one trend that will flow through. Obviously, gold price softens and those costs come off. We see a portfolio, as we complete our divestment work in the first part of next year, really start focusing on our 11 managed operations and the three projects we've got in execution. Those projects in execution will start to deliver new ounces in the latter part of next year and then that will flow through to '26 and '27. So, we do have some new lower cost ounces coming on, and that will help us have a portfolio of operations that, over the long-term are up around or about at 6 million ounce run rate and about 150,000 tons of copper. We're not going to chase volume for volume sake. Our focus is going to be on driving margins and ensuring that we're getting the best value, the best return on that capital that's invested. Another driver of our all-in sustaining cost is the important work we're putting into tailings facilities and ensuring that, we have a set of tailings facilities that have the appropriate capacity and structure to support these very long life operations. We have some of that spend, which is, it's not spend that's consistent over the whole time, but there are periods of elevated spend in sustaining capital in any mining company as you ensure your tailings facilities are up to scratch. So that's another factor in terms of our 2025 and 2026 story.
Karyn Ovelmen: If I can probably...
Matthew Murphy: Go ahead. Sorry.
Karyn Ovelmen: I wanted to build a little bit on Tom's point on the 6 million run rate. And just as a reminder, Boddington is in two years of high stripping and lower than normal ounces. So, Boddington will keep getting back to its normal production. But in Telfer, we'll start to see coming back in the New Year. Cadia we have been predicting all along that we will see lower grades coming through, but as PC 2-3 comes in during the next two years, we'll see Cadia production step up as well. And then Lihir is also two years of high investment and we'll start to get back into higher grade ores in the near-term. That's to just build a little bit of granularity on Tom's point.
Thomas Palmer: Particularly, we get more ounces out of the shaft, Tanami as it gets commissioned into '27, '28. We got half our north to start to produce gold in the second half of next year. So, we've got that reinvestment back in the business. Brings ounces on that complement the numbers we're talking about for this year and next year.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Is there a timeline where you're thinking, you'll be able to provide more formal asset-by-asset, multiyear guidance? Is that the plan maybe early next year?
Thomas Palmer: It will be in due course, Matt, into next year. We'll certainly be focusing on giving greater granularity on the 2025 numbers in February. We're busy still, and we're still in this near the end of the second phase of the divestment of our North American assets and that works progressing well, but we need to close out that work. As we've got that clear line of sight to completing that divestment program, focusing on our 11 managed operations going forward and that's three projects in execution. With that clarity, we'll look to come back with some more color on this go forward portfolio into next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Anita Soni from CIBC. Anita, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Yes. One of the questions that I guess are now part of the questions I had were all very detail oriented but don't seem that relevant anymore. Could I just ask you in terms of I guess longer-term Cadia the dust emissions, like, when do you expect to get approvals for that? That's what gets you to 35 million tons per annum right?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sorry, Anita. I'm not sure, if I could just put a little clarity, dust emissions. I just want to make sure that I understand your question.
Anita Soni: Sorry. On Cadia, the original goal or target was to get to, I think, 35 million tons per annum. Is that still valid? And what kind of approvals do you need? And when do you expect those?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure that because the dust is not necessarily directly related to the tiling stamp approvals. There's a couple of things that needs to happen around the tiling stamp that is all underway. The first thing as I've mentioned is the repay of the southern wall of the northern dam. And then, there's further expansions that is underway. There's a number of permit applications that's in place and underway. We are balancing the permitting requirements, the expansion of the timings dam, and Cadia Panel Cave development to make sure that we've got optimal capital efficiency.
Anita Soni: Okay. Cerro Negro, original target I think was around 3.5 million ton per annum. I think you're doing -- you are significantly under that right now and have been for a while. When do you think you'll get that asset up to the original target, or is that still valid?
Natascha Viljoen: Cerro Negro, our largest focus area for Cerro Negro is in productivity and making sure that the baseline operation gets back to where we need it to be from a productivity point of view. We've got all of the mining areas available. We have all of the equipment available. The focus is 100% on productivity to bring us back to where we need to be.
Anita Soni: Thanks, Natascha.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Parkin from National Bank. Mike, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Parkin: Hi, guys. Congrats on getting the synergy target achieved. Of the $500 million how much of that flowed through OpEx?
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, Mike. Obviously, the G&A component of that is part of your OpEx. The supply chain is a combination between improving costs and opportunity to get to productivity and volume. A lot of the full potential work is around volume. So you get more productivity with the current gold price, you get that benefit flowing through. Probably of the amount of that delivery, it's probably less than half has come from that operational exit of cost improvements, as opposed to the productivity and volume improvements and the free cash flow that you get coming through. If I look through that, if I look at where we sit, it's one of the earlier questions as we're closing out the integration, an important part of closing out the integration is completing our divestments and having a clear line of sight to 11 managed operations through projects and execution. I'm not happy with the G&A that we have for that go forward business and that's an area that we're going to be focusing on to get that number down to match the go forward business. That's a little bit of that high cost to carry as you look through that transition, but as we get that clarity on the remaining divestments going out the door, we need to ensure that our G&A is matching the size of the go forward business and we expect to see some be working hard to get some improvement in that area in the months ahead.
Mike Parkin: Okay. Just a follow-up on that. Because you've achieved that, is that fully reflected in your third quarter numbers? Just wondering, if you look at your quarter-over-quarter OpEx, you're up about 7% quarter-over-quarter, trying to understand how where the savings come in with the fourth quarter guidance if all the synergies have already been realized, or is it a bit of a deferral in terms of when they start to flow through the financials?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. I think you see, certainly those that impact the cost base are there. They're in our direct costs. I think what you're going to -- I think key driver is going to flow through in the fourth quarter is a very strong gold production quarter and we're certainly well set up to be delivering on those commitments through the fourth quarter. That's what you're going to see drive that improvement in the fourth quarter is that higher production, getting them to sales, matching that production to ensure that the unit costs are coming to the levels that we've guided to for the fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Lawson Winder from Bank of America. Lawson, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Lawson Winder: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Tom and team, and thank you for the update. I just wanted to ask about capital allocation and in the context of a new story that the Prime Minister of PNG, recently called on all stakeholders involved Wafi, to finalize the special mining lease and the mine development contract sort of ASAP. I think he actually set a deadline of, like, December of this year. And so, that got me thinking, in terms of capital allocation, is that a sign that Wafi might be taking precedent as a preferred project in the portfolio over some of the other options?
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, Lawson. We continue to work very closely with, Joint Venture Partners, Harmony and the PNG government on those negotiations, to convert what is a very robust and competitive framework, MOU, through the mineral development contract, not only a special mining lease, that would then move into a process of starting to understand updates to feasibility studies and a whole bunch of study work that would come once you've reached that conclusion of those negotiations. So important work and working very constructively with all of the parties around the table. Any project in our pipeline is competing for capital, and we are going to be very disciplined in terms of any project that we take into execution, going to have confidence in terms of the cost to build it, the time to deliver it and the returns from that invested capital. Our plate is full with three projects in execution, our Tanami expansion two at Ahafo North and the Panel Caves at Cadia. We're going to ensure that we properly deliver on our commitments on those projects, and then and only then we bring on our next project. Wafi-Golpu sits there in the pipeline with five other very interesting projects to compete for capital.
Lawson Winder: Okay. Thanks very much for that context. And then, just as a follow-up on some of the earlier questions on the labor inflation that drove the cost a little higher in the quarter. I believe yourselves and some of your peers budgeted approximately 4%, labor inflation for 2024. I mean, it would be helpful to kind of put some numbers around that, in terms of, what's the realized experience in terms of labor inflation so far this year? Are you expected versus that 4% that seems to be the industry standard at the start of the year?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. In our direct costs, half the cost is labor. About half of that is our employee base and that's the 4%. When you think about the people who work for Newmont across nine countries, when you average, aggregate the wage escalation, it's about 4%. The other cost base is the cost to for all the contracted services we use, whether that be maintenance shutdowns, maintenance that you use to supplement your workforce, cost of running camps, cost of flying people to and from clients, all of those sorts of costs. That's where we're seeing some escalation beyond what we'd assumed at the start of the year. As we look into 2025, then that's what we're guiding to today in terms of how we're seeing those costs flow through. Obviously, those costs have escalated over the course of this year and looking to capture that level of escalation, that we see flowing through to next year in terms of that broader unit cost for Newmont in 2025.
Operator: Next question comes from Alex Hacking from HSBC. Alex, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Alex Hacking: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to clarify some of the guidance commentary from earlier. So on next year, production from Tier 1 is going to be flattish. What assumption is embedded in that Nevada gold mine? Thank you.
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Alex. To answer that question, we provided granularity on Lihir and Brucejack in terms of pretty significant movers in our managed portfolio. The rest of the operations in our core portfolio going forward, we're assuming that, the run rates you're seeing through the course of this year will flow through 2025.
Alex Hacking: Just to clarify, Nevada gold mines flat next year?
Thomas Palmer: Alex, I'm answering that question in terms of the rest of our portfolio without getting specific.
Alex Hacking: Okay. And then, on the following up on Matt's question on the mid-term outlook, it sounds like 6.7 million ounces in 2028 is under review, let's say. But did I hear you say, Tom, that 6 million ounces is kind of a mid-term target or did I mishear that? Thanks.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Alex. When I look at our 11 managed operations and the three projects we've got in execution that will deliver ounces over the next three to five years into that portfolio of operations. It remains 11 managed operations because they're all essentially brownfield expansions and the long life. I mean, each of those orebodies underneath those 11 managed operations has got several decades out in front of them. I look at that portfolio and say, it can produce over the long-term at average around 6 million ounces of gold, about 150,000 tons of copper. Might have some years we pushed north of six and there'll be other years where you're south of six, but over the long-term, that's how we think about this portfolio we've assembled. 11 plus three, six, 150,000. Our growth is in margins, Alex, where we focus our time. Thanks, Alex.
Operator: The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. Tanya, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Just wanted to come back to the cost, so just so that we understand what is Newmont related and what is industry related. Just want to make sure, Tom and Natascha, understand that what's Newmont related in these costs have to do with your particular operations on volumes, which you've given us on lower volumes at Lihir and Brucejack. And then, you've given us the additional sustaining capital that you have at some of your in Cadia on your tailings and Nevada Gold Mines, some other stuff there. You mentioned G&A as well on your all-in sustaining. Is it fair to assume that the only industry-related cost is your labor which pertains to the contractors, which is happier? 50% is your labor cost and 50% of that is contractors. If that's the case, Tom, I remember you mentioning that, in contractor inflation was, 12% or 14%, if I can remember correct. Can you just maybe share with us where you are seeing this contractor inflation? Is it related in Australia? Is it in the U.S? I'm just trying to understand, that's my first question. Just I'm trying to understand, if I understand this correctly.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. Good morning. Just clarifying, you're talking about '25 versus '24, as you're looking at your numbers?
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes.
Thomas Palmer: Yes. I think, certainly the '24 to '25 story is the volume story and the sustaining capital story. Largely, what you're seeing is the cost we're seeing this year for labor, whether it be employees or, contractor labor, staying about the same going into next year. The driver is lower volume, and the sustaining capital '24 to '25.
Tanya Jakusconek: But this labor, that's contractors, am I correct to speak to have that 12% to 14% inflation in your contractors? Has that not changed? I'm just trying to understand if that's still the case.
Thomas Palmer: Yes. I think about answering at this point, Tanya, in terms of what's in our cost run rate as we close out '24, it's flowing into '25. We're not seeing a step-up of the percentages you're talking about. The rates of our costs as we close out the year, we're seeing that slowing to '25.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Alright. Maybe I'll ask my second question then. Maybe just on, Natascha, you mentioned that, as we look into next year and the year after, next two years, we're going to have Cadia's production decline from about this 370,000 ounce level. Could you kind of just share with us where I should think about the time before we set back up again on the other case then?
Natascha Viljoen: I think yes. That's right, Tanya. You will remember, we have been saying that as PC 1 and PC 2 come to the end of their life, or of its life we see lower grades coming through and we have been predicting that we'll continue to see that going into next year. At the same time, PC 2-3 is now ramping up. We've seen that cave, actually cave. We will slowly wrap that up over the next two years to full production. PC 2-3 will then start to replace the lower production from PC 1 and PC 2. And then PC 1-2 is only targeted towards the end of the day guide.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning and have a good rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Thomas Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Turning to the next slide, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Before I cover our results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the important work we are doing to reinvigorate our safety systems. Following the tragic loss of four of our colleagues over the last year, we initiated a comprehensive, systematic review of our safety and risk management systems, in order to better understand the key challenges and opportunities we have to improve our safety performance going forward. Our enhanced approach includes a heightened level of diligence across our entire fatality risk management assurance model, bolstering our leadership work in the field to ensure we have a balanced approach between both the quantity and quality of our critical control verifications, and an increased focus on leaders, coaching leaders and their teams aimed at building and strengthening capability through all levels of our organization. With this reinvigorated approach, we are actively driving improvements in safety performance and strengthening operational effectiveness across all of our managed operations. Turning now to our second quarter highlights. We delivered solid operational performance as planned, keeping us firmly on track to achieve our 2024 guidance and positioning us to deliver improving financial results. These solid results have also enabled us to progress our capital allocation priorities, which I'll touch on in a moment. With a continued focus on safely delivering, we've also made meaningful progress on the four key commitments we made to our shareholders at the start of the year. First, we continue to strengthen Newmont's position as the gold industry's recognized sustainability leader. During the second quarter, and as I just mentioned, we launched a safety refresh across our managed operations globally and are leveraging this important work to reinvigorate our safety systems, tools, standards and in-field leadership work. Supported by this approach, we've restarted operations at Cerro Negro in late May, returning our focus to safe and efficient mining in this highly prospective district in Argentina. In May, we also published our annual Climate Report, summarizing our performance for the sites managed by Newmont throughout 2023. Moving to our second commitment. Newmont has created a world-class portfolio focused on Tier 1 and emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. From this portfolio in the second quarter, we produced 1.6 million ounces of gold and 477,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Notably, this included 38,000 tons of copper for the quarter. We generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $594 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And yesterday, we announced the monetization of Batu Hijau deferred payment obligations, and we expect to receive $153 million upon closing by September 30. It is also worth noting that Newmont received $44 million associated with contingent payments from production of Batu Hijau, bringing total proceeds that we will receive this year from our former operation to $197 million. In addition, we received the first $180 million payment from the sale that we announced last quarter, that Lundin Gold financing facilities. From these two transactions, we will receive nearly $530 million by the end of this year. With this progress, and with the confidence we have in our divestiture program, we now expect to reach at least $2 billion from the sale of our seven high-quality non-core assets alone. Taking all of this into account, we continue to build momentum, enabling us to advance our capital allocation priorities. Since our last call, we continue to safely progress the projects we have in execution from an industry-leading organic project pipeline, including the second expansion at Tanami, our new miner Ahafo North, and the two new Block Caves at Cadia. We have retired $250 million in debt, and we have returned approximately $540 million to shareholders in the form of regular dividends and share repurchases, which Karyn will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Turning now to synergies. We remain firmly on track to deliver above and beyond our initial commitment of $500 million. In the second quarter, we achieved $100 million in synergies, bringing our run rate to $205 million, since we closed our acquisition of Newcrest only eight months ago. With this solid momentum, we have now disbanded our back-office integration team and remain firmly on track to achieve a $335 million run rate by the end of this year, well ahead of our initial estimates. Looking at the three components of our synergy delivery, and starting with full potential. We are now advancing into the delivery stage of the initiatives we have identified at Lihir, Cadia and Red Chris, with the largest value drivers coming from our two new Tier 1 assets in Lihir and Cadia. On our call last quarter, we provided an update on the opportunities we have identified at Lihir. In this quarter, I'll briefly describe some of the opportunities we see in front of us at Cadia. We recently completed our full potential diagnosis phase at Cadia, from which we have identified a series of initiatives that are expected to deliver more than $100 million of value by the end of next year. During this first phase, we had a team of experts from Newmont's Global Technical Services group working to support the site to identify opportunities to high production and improved cash flows. As one example of this, and through collaboration with Boddington, Cadia is working to optimize the output from its high-pressure riding roll circuit in the mill. With these HPGR improvements, Cadia will be able to lift its mill feed by approximately 80 tons an hour or more than 600,000 tons a year. Implementing the initiatives we have identified and leveraging the experience we have gained over the last 10 years with our Full Potential program, we are working with the team at Cadia to increase average mill throughput to 34 million tons per annum, representing a meaningful step up in productivity from this world-class gold and copper asset. With Lihir, Cadia and Red Chris, all now entering the delivery phase of Full Potential. We are on track to meet our initial $200 million commitment. Moving to supply chain synergies. We continue to leverage our combined scale to drive improved commercial outcomes for both pricing and terms. In the second quarter, we realized $60 million in synergies from around 40 initiatives in contracted services, mining equipment, energy, information technology among other categories. And we have a clear line of sight to reach $140 million run rate by the end of this year, as we progress our commercial work across several spend categories, including chemicals, explosives, grinding media, tyres, fuel, as well as spare parts and rotables. And finally, turning to G&A synergies. We have now achieved 95% of our initial $100 million commitment with an additional $15 million realized during the second quarter. The latest G&A synergies have primarily been coming from continued labor rationalization and ongoing reductions in our contractor spend. Taking these synergies into account, combined with the higher production volumes anticipated in the second half of this year, we expect to deliver lower unit costs in the third and fourth quarters. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Natascha, and then on to Karyn for an update on our operational and financial performance for the quarter. Over to you, Natascha.
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our managed operations delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations and outlook for the year. With a focus on safe and efficient production at each of our managed operations, we are heading into the second half of the year with confidence in our ability to deliver on our business plan and the commitments Tom reiterated earlier. And similar to the first half of the year, our operational results in the third and fourth quarters will be largely driven by reduction from our six managed Tier 1 operations. Reflecting on these and beginning with Tanami, we delivered higher production in the second quarter as planned, while effectively progressing the second underground expansion. Tanami continues to be a reliable performer and remains well positioned to access higher grade stopes in the second half of the year from the Liberator ore body. Moving to Boddington. We reported consistent results as stripping in the North and South pits continued ahead of plan in the second quarter. And with plant, plant and crusher maintenance now beside us, Boddington is expected to deliver strong mold throughput and slightly higher gold and copper production in the third quarter. At Penasquito, we delivered higher gold and zinc production due to higher grades from the Chile Colorado pit and strong mill performance in the second quarter. Production levels are expected to remain steady in the third quarter with significant increase in gold production in the fourth quarter as we return to mining ore from the Penasquito toward the end of the year. Turning now to Ahafo. The girth gear replacement was slightly completed ahead of schedule, and I'm really proud of the Ahafo team for completing this significant body of work so efficiently. The change-out spanned over 12 months and involved that fabrication of a new 6.5-meter diameter girth gear, along with the transport with more than 50 tons of steel all the way from Australia to Ghana. During this entire time, the team continued to optimize the processing circuit, ensuring our most productive milling circuit was able to run as efficiently as possible. Beginning in the third quarter, we expect a meaningful step-up in production from Ahafo, as we will improve mill throughput, deliver consistently strong mining rates from Subika underground and access higher grades from the Subika open pit. At Cadia, we delivered solid gold and copper production as planned due to steady grades of strong bond performance in the second quarter. As flagged it into our guidance, production at Cadia is expected to gradually decline through the rest of the year, as we transition mining to the next panel cave, and we expect these lower grades to continue until the next panel cave is fully wrapped up. And finally, at Lihir, second quarter production decreased from the first quarter, primarily due to heavy rainfall, which contributed to soft ground conditions that in turn impacted mine sequencing. Production levels are expected to remain consistent in the third quarter as the site commences a planned 120-day shutdown of the primary autoclave. And just to bring the autoclave shutdown into perspective, the process includes not only shutting down the autoclave itself, but also removing the brick layer at [PYROFLEX] membrane, inspecting the 5.5-meter diameter steel shell, applying a high-temperature tolerant membrane and rebricking the 48-meter long structure, which is nearly the length of a new Olympic swimming pool. Once complete, we anticipate coal production will return to normal levels in the fourth quarter, positioning Lihir for a strong finish to the year. Taking everything into account, we anticipate an increase in gold production mix quarter, setting us up to deliver Lihir's higher production in the fourth quarter. Our performance in the second half of the year will be driven by higher grades at Penasquito, Ahafo and Tanami, improved throughput from Lihir and Boddington, along with an expected improvement from our non-managed operations. During the second quarter, we continue to progress the four key projects we currently have in execution. At Ahafo North, the construction of the crusher and mill are advancing well. We have four the concrete foundations for the SAG and ball mills and have erected all six carbon in leach tanks. Earthworks continue for the tailing storage facilities, along with the pre-mine development activities for this very exciting new mine in West Africa. At the second expansion at Tanami, our team remains focused on the concrete liner of the lower section of the shaft, and we continue to advance construction activities both underground and on surface. Underground, we are progressing the pressure and conveyor systems and have just safely and successfully completed boring nearly 200 cubic meters of concrete for the underground pressure chamber. On surface, we are working to complete the winder building, which will house the wasting operations for many decades to come. Turning to Cadia. The two Block Caves are each progressing well. We are continuing to commission two new draw points at panel caves 2-3, and we are anticipating that initial caving is expected to remain by the end of the year. For panel caves 1-2, we are advancing underground development and the engineering work needed to design the crushing and material handling systems at this Tier 1 gold and copper operation. With that, I'll turn over to Karyn to cover our financial performance and the progress we are making on our capital allocation priorities.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Natascha. Turning to the next slide. Let's begin with a review of the financial highlights for the quarter. Building upon Tom and Natascha's remarks, Newmont delivered strong operational and financial results in the second quarter. We reported $4.4 billion of revenue at an average realized gold price of $2,347 per ounce and costs applicable to sales of $1,152 per gold ounce, an all-in sustaining cost of $1,562 an ounce, which were higher over the first quarter, primarily due to lower production volumes, higher royalties from a stronger gold price environment and increased sustaining capital this quarter due to spend on tailings work at Cadia and the planned purchase of additional trucks at Merian. Taking everything into account, we reported adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion, driven by solid production volumes and higher gold prices. Adjusted net income was $0.72 per diluted share and was more than 30% higher than the first quarter. The most notable adjustment to net income for the quarter was an approximately $0.20 add-back related to a non-cash impairment to reflect our progress at the conclusion of Phase 1 in the divestment process for North America. As a reminder, assets that are classified as held for sale require a specific evaluation under US GAAP and need to be recorded at the lower, the carrying value or fair value of cost to sell. And we will continue to assess the current carrying value of all assets held for sale each quarter, which may result in future adjustments until the assets are divested. It is important to note that this impairment does not reflect the future potential of these operations in their entirety or what the ultimate purchase price might be. We also generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and $594 million of free cash flow, which does not include the first $180 million payment received from the sale of the Lundin Gold financing facilities announced last quarter. It does include $263 million of unfavorable working capital changes, largely due to a build in stockpiles of $185 million, primarily attributed to Lihir and Telfer, a build in trade and other receivables of $140 million, due to higher grade concentrate produced at Penasquito and the timing of sales at Cadia, and $107 million of reclamation spend, primarily related to the construction of the Yanacocha water treatment facilities. With $166 million in reclamation spent to date, we expect that payments will continue ramping up in the second half of the year, which will be a working capital headwind in the third and fourth quarters. And whilst, we are pleased with the improvement in free cash flow, we are still not satisfied and are working to further improve margins. Looking ahead, we anticipate higher free cash flows in the second half of the year, driven by increased production volumes and lower unit costs, as Tom and Natascha just mentioned. Heading into the second half of the year, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance of reduction, cost and capital spend. And as Natascha mentioned, production is expected to increase in the third quarter, with the year's strongest performance anticipated in the fourth quarter. Unit cost will be closely correlated to production with the added benefit of full potential improvements and additional synergies realized in the latter part of the year. Today, we announced two divestments, including the monetization of our Batu Hijau deferred payment obligations and the sale of our Lundin Gold financing facilities. In total, these divestitures are expected to generate nearly $530 million in gross proceeds by the end of the year. With this momentum, the benefit of higher commodity prices contributing to enhanced free cash flows and the confidence in our asset divestiture program, we were able to prioritize shareholder returns sooner than anticipated while concurrently executing on debt reductions. Since our last earnings call, we repurchased 5.7 million shares at an average price of $43 per share for a total cost of $250 million, including $104 million repurchased during the second quarter and $146 million in July. And we purchased $250 million in nominal debt for $227 million, or $0.90 on the dollar. Additionally, we maintained an investment-grade balance sheet and ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in total liquidity. And we declared a fixed common second quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with dividend declared for the past two quarters. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we will continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects and returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll pass it back to Tom for closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. At the start of this year, I outlined the four key commitments that we have made to our shareholders. And I'd like to end today's call with a recap of the progress we have made against them in the second quarter. First and most importantly, we commenced a systematic review of our safety and risk management systems. We safely delivered solid production as planned, keeping us firmly on track to meet our full year guidance for both ounces and costs. We announced meaningful progress on our portfolio optimization commitments with the monetization of our Batu Hijau deferred payment obligations. We realized $100 million in synergies, bringing the total delivered to $205 million, since we closed our acquisition of Newcrest in November last year. We've demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns, delivering $540 million through both regular dividends and share repurchases. And we strengthened our balance sheet with $250 million of debt reduction. As we enter the second half of this year, I am confident in our ability to deliver high production, more potential improvements and additional synergies, all of which will contribute to lower unit costs in the third and fourth quarters, and execute on our portfolio optimization strategy through the divestment of our non-core assets, and to progress our capital allocation priorities, all positioning Newmont for a strong finish to this year. And with that, I'll thank you for your time today, and turn it back over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lawson Winder from Bank of America Securities. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Lawson Winder: Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning, Tom and team, nice quarterly results, and thanks for the update. I also like to just acknowledge the - congratulations for realizing value on the deferred payments from Batu Hijau, which I think most of us have forgotten about. But I wanted to ask about the larger asset sales process Akyem, Telfer and the North American assets. What is your latest thinking on timing of each? And with the stronger gold price, are you seeing upward pressure on offer prices? Thanks very much.
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, Lawson. And thanks for your question. And it's a chapter that we closed in our relationship with Batu Hijau, an asset I've been associated with for my 10 years at Newmont and was an active part of the original divestment process. So in some ways, it's a sad market to close that chapter on what is still a great copper mine, and one that Newmont built a generation ago. So it's nice to be able to clean up our noncore portfolio and realize that sort of value. In terms of our broader portfolio optimization rationalization process, it's firmly on track, and we continue to follow a very rigorous process to ensure we get full and fair value for these assets. And these assets are sold to operators that can continue to operate them and maintain them, with the principles that we have at Newmont. Maybe just covering the program, we've had four parallel streams running. The first one is we've just talked about is the - cleaning up the opportunities around our noncore equity portfolio. And the two major items there were the London Gold transaction and Batu Hijau, but we'll continue to look for any opportunities that might be in that noncore equity portfolio. At Akyem, we're well advanced in process with Akyem. So, we completed Phase 1 some time ago. We had 20 parties through that process who made bids, and we've taken seven parties into Phase 2. And we're at the end of the Phase 2 process. So, we've had all those parties visit site and participate in management presentations. And they are now preparing their Phase 2 bids for us to consider. So we're at that stage where really, by the time you get into Phase 3, you're down to one or two parties starting to finalize that transaction. So that is progressing very well. It's progressing on track. And we're certainly seeing a competitive process and good value coming through. The North American process, we're just concluding Phase 1. So we had some 67 parties actively participate in Phase 1. And we had around 24 bids submitted. And we had everything from bids for a single asset. If you remember, North America is Cripple, Greek, Victor, Eleanor, Porcupine, Musselwhite and our coffee project up in the Yukon. So we've had a range of bids from a single asset, to a bundle of assets to the full portfolio. And we are busily now having received those bids just in recent days, working through a process of assessing those, and determining, which parties will take into Phase 2. Again, that's progressing well, and there's some very nice competition in that process. So pretty more than pleased with how both Akyem and North America are progressing. And then Telfer continues to progress well. We continue to actively work that process and also slightly confident around how that process is progressing also. So everything is on track and pretty pleased with what we're seeing in terms of bids coming through, and the type of organizations that are looking to make offers, and ultimately acquire these noncore assets. Karyn, do you want to build on that?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes and just as a reminder, the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP requires that there's an advanced process, it's auditable, there's viable buyers and the probability that the divestitures will be completed in 12 months, which for us would then be March of 2025.
Lawson Winder: Thanks for clearing up that timing. And just one follow up on Telfer. Thank you for clarifying a lot of, I think, folks' thoughts around Telfer in terms of both timing and value. But one bit of feedback we've been getting is just some concerns around the tailings dam issues, and whether or not that might have impacted the ability to monetize that asset for value. Do you have any thoughts on that? Or is there any feedback you may have received from potential interested parties that might help calm some of those concerns?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. The approach we took with Telfer - and certainly talked to this a number of times over the last few months - is ultimately being radically transparent around those tailings issues. So we - since we saw the first of the sinkholes developed on Christmas Eve, have been very transparent with the regulators, with our workforce and with any potential buyers around, what the issue is and what the work is to remediate those issues. So that the issues are well understood and the remediation is well understood, and we have been completely transparent around what that looks like, and the pathway to remediate. So there is a clear pathway to remediate, and I might just get an attachment to give a little bit more detail, as to what that looks like and maybe a bit of the timing, around that, because that then serves to understand with that transparency, what any potential buyers looking at. In terms of the ability to acquire Telfer and to be able to run the operation for some time to come. I should add before I pass to Natascha, we continue to operate the mine. So we're building stockpiles in front of the mill. So as soon as the tailings facilities are through the remediation work, the plant can start up and we can continue to process ore and produce gold again. Thanks Natascha?
Natascha Viljoen: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, Daniel. Firstly, I just want to reiterate the point that we've been transparent with all parties involved throughout the process. Secondly, I want to reiterate that both the TSS 7 and 8 dams are stable. We're progressing the TSS 7 rehabilitation as planned, and it is all around how do we fall in the sinkhole, placing membranes and preventing in that way any further erosion in those areas. So whilst we're working on the stability on remediating the sinkholes in TSS 7, TSS 8, we've completed the rehabilitation. And we have authorization to continue with a lift on TSS 8 that we are required to do before we can do any more depositioning on that dam. It is on schedule, and we are planning to start up Telfer in the fourth quarter when we - when the rehabilitation and the lift would have been done. And apologies, I realize we're still talking to those and then - we haven't progress to Daniel my apologies.
Lawson Winder: Quite all right. Thank you very much for those responses.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Lawson.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Daniel Major from UBS. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Daniel Major: Hi, thanks so much. Can you hear me, okay?
Thomas Palmer: Yes, we can. Thanks, Daniel.
Daniel Major: Yes. My question is focused on the decision to start the buyback and sort of comes in two parts. Firstly, from a perspective of kind of run rate of cash returns relative to debt reduction going forward, how should we look at that? You've sort of indicated around half of the free cash flow will be allocated to debt reduction and buybacks? Is that what we should be considering for the second half? That's the first part of the question.
Thomas Palmer: Karyn, maybe pick that one up?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sure. Yes, we have time on the debt. So we purposely put out the $1 billion tranche for 2026, and so our commitment was over a 24-month period when we put that in place. So we do have time on the debt. The Batu as well as the Lundin just allowed us to be able to opportunistically in the market do some open market purchases.
Daniel Major: Hello? Sorry - and the buy...
Thomas Palmer: Hi Daniel, we didn't miss the - second part. Did you want to build?
Daniel Major: Yes, sorry. Well, the other part was the run rate of the buyback going forward, what we should be thinking? And then just to add to that, I mean, what gave you the confidence to initiate the cash returns earlier? Is it the gold price environment, the operational visibility for the second half, or the certainty on - or narrowing in on the proceeds for divestments?
Karyn Ovelmen: All three of those, Daniel, provided that opportunity for us. In terms of the pace of the share buybacks as we go forward, that will be driven by our free cash flow realization and proceeds from the divestitures. So as we've just mentioned, we're proceeding very well and are very confident in the ultimate execution on those investments. But we'll pace our share buybacks as we realize those proceeds as well as the free cash flow.
Thomas Palmer: And maybe just to build on the debt side, Daniel, there was opportunistically during the second quarter with those process coming through. We've got that tranche sitting out there two years and we'll look to be opportunistic in terms of where there might be some good buying, whilst we manage that period out to when that tranche is due.
Daniel Major: Great. Thanks so much.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Dan.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning. I think that's me. Thank you, everyone. I want to have - just ask a question on the technical side. Maybe Natascha, to you. Just on Penasquito. You did mention in 10-Q that Q3 should be similar to Q2 on the gold side, strong Q4 driven by grades as we get into the new pit. But the production from the non-gold metals did very well in Q2. Our previous guidance had been that they would be evenly distributed throughout the year. How should I think about Penasquito on the gold side as we go through Q3 and Q4?
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tanya. I think as we've spoken about before, we are mining predominantly in Chile Colorado with these first three quarters of the year. As we are progressing a pushback in Penasquito pit. Chile Colorado as you would remember, is higher in the zinc, lead and the other metals. And therefore, our production in those other metals in the first three quarters are higher. We have been progressing this payback in Penasquito a bit faster than expected. So we do expect to be back in the fourth quarter in Penasquito pit, giving us that advantage of higher gold grades in that fourth quarter. And we'll probably see about a 25% increase gold grade in that fourth quarter.
Thomas Palmer: And Natascha, maybe just building on that, I think for the second quarter, with ore coming from Chile Colorado, good performance through the mill engine. So we're getting good throughputs and recoveries. So as we - and it's a third quarter that's also got feed primarily coming from Chile Colorado. So if the mill can perform and the grades present, we can potentially see some better lead and zinc because of the ore is coming from Chile Colorado, but it was a bit higher than maybe you were expecting was due to really good mill performance by Dave Meador and the team down there.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. As I think about the second half, and I think you mentioned that there will be a step-up in production, to volume and then stronger volumes in Q4. And I think about this cost structure because in order for us to get these costs down, we do need the volume, number one. And obviously, the $130 million in synergies that you mentioned. I'm just trying to picture for myself, should I be thinking that the step-up into Q3 like almost like 26% of production coming out of the year and then 28% in Q4, and $130 million, majority of those savings coming in Q4? I'm just trying to understand how I'm going to get to your guidance on the costing side, with the volume and the synergies. And also where the $130 million in synergies are coming from, if I can have a breakdown of those?
Thomas Palmer: And think about – I'll paint a picture this way, and I think you're not too far off the mark. You certainly have to see the synergies getting through - particularly those coming from full potential in the fourth quarter, as those programs get their momentum up. You're certainly going to see the highest quarter four gold ounces in the fourth quarter. That's from some of our key assets that Natascha covered in her comments. The two non-managed joint ventures, so NGM and PV, need to deliver on their commitments and they've got that strong fourth quarter. Our direct costs are pretty stable across the year. And certainly what we're seeing in the first half flowing through the second half, pretty stable. So, I think the picture you're painting in terms of that third quarter weighting to the fourth quarter weighting, is a reasonable position to be thinking about in terms of that weight between the third and the fourth quarter. You will see a step up in the third, and then a step up into the fourth to get to our numbers.
Tanya Jakusconek: And maybe just if I could have an understanding. Maybe just an understanding of the $130 million in synergies. Can you just give me a breakdown of what's coming from? Is it like what very little is left in G&A? Is it supply chain like $3 million of it and $100 million in the operations? I'm just trying to understand how I should think about that $130 million coming in yet?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Certainly, when you think about G&A, and it's the same we saw for Goldcorp, similar size companies, that's around about the mark. So we've largely seen that come through. Still pushing hard on - we've got a strong commercial team working hard on all those fronts. So you're going to see a good amount come from that supply chain work. And then you'll start to see both Lihir and Cadia bit of regress in the fourth quarter. So not much from G&A to percentage coming from supply chain, as that work start to kick in. And then you'll start to see in the fourth quarter some of the full potential of the operation starting to kick through, really, they start to show up in 2025. But again, the split, you're actually not too far off the mark.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I appreciate you taking my question.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Tanya.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Murphy from Jefferies. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Matthew Murphy: Hi. Just a follow-up on the share repurchases. Just - margins are good. They're getting better. You still have asset disposals ahead, and you're out pretty early and strong out of the gate on the buyback. So how should we think about what happens, when you hit the $1 billion mark? I think that's the total allowed right now through 2026. So should we be thinking the Board will reevaluate that potentially earlier than that? Or should we think about once you hit the $1 billion, do you start picking up CapEx again?
Thomas Palmer: Good morning Matt. Certainly the $1 billion was our initial commitment, and it's a bend. So we're committed to $2 billion of proceeds from divestments of the seven noncore assets and $1 billion going to share repurchase and $1 billion going to debt reduction. So that's how that comes together. Now as we start to see the divestment process come through, and as I was talking earlier in terms of what we see coming now in terms of offers. But Phase 2 and Phase 1 offers and get a view as to what the proceeds are plus the cash that we'll generate in this price environment, as we near the end of that $1 billion program. We'll sit down with our Board and discuss what another tranche may look like. But certainly, as we think about our return of capital, it's through buybacks will be the vehicle that we'll use. So you would expect that we would look to extend that program, if - that everything would play out as we expect, going forward, the conversation we have with our Board at the appropriate time. Karyn, do you want to build on that?
Karyn Ovelmen: Absolutely. As I already indicated, the free cash flow realization and the divestitures will be what drives the share buyback. And administratively, as Tom said, we'll work with the Board if we have to read up the authorization to meet that the proceeds as well as the free cash flow to execute on share buybacks as we go forward.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Great. That's very clear. And then maybe just as a follow-on on the CapEx question. Do you view an increase in CapEx down the line? Is that kind of like a time line related thing where you integrate Newcrest for a number of years, and kind of focus on capital returns. And then eventually get back into potentially higher development CapEx?
Thomas Palmer: No, Matt. We've been clear in our strategy. We have built a portfolio of Tier 1 long-life assets, lever managed operations and nonmanaged joint ventures, something that hasn't been seen before in the gold industry. I think for the first time, we have a long life, very long-life gold mining business with Tier 1 assets. Key to running a long-life portfolio is our discipline around capital allocation. So, if we think about this portfolio going forward and our pipeline of projects, the six big projects sitting in our pipeline, our discipline around the amount of capital we'll put towards sustaining capital for that portfolio, and the $1.3 billion towards development capital doesn't change. It's the discipline around managing our long-life portfolio and having a view on capital that's like two decades out. And thinking about what that means, is key to what we've built. So we'll demonstrate that over time, but the expectation you should expect from us, is that $1.3 billion is the amount of money that we allocate, to reinvest back in the business each and every year.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Great. That's clear. Thanks, Tom.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Anita Soni from CIBC Wall Markets. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Hello, Tom and team. So a lot of the questions have been asked and answered. I'm going to ask about the working capital as it evolves over the back half of the year. So I think you said you had about $166 million of the rest, the $600 million reclamation spend - spent to-date. So that leaves around $434 million. So that would - is it an even split for that spending in Q3 and Q4? And then also, the other aspect would be the Telfer spend. Are you going to continue to mine at that rate? And how much was that spend again? I thought I heard $185 million, but I could be wrong about that? Thanks.
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, Anita. Thanks. I'll get Karyn will pick up the working capital question and then Natascha on the approach to Telfer discount. I'll leave Karen to begin.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thanks, Anita. The first half of the year traditionally tends to produce adverse working capital changes. So we expect the free cash flow generation to improve in the second half of the year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do have some unfavorable impact. So, you had to go to water treatment. And as you said, yes, spent 166 to-date. And you're right, it's about 400 to 450 to be spent in the second half of the year, with more of that weighted towards the fourth quarter than the third. Maybe just to - and then also just a reminder, the other kind of plan is the remaining stamp-duty, just about $30 million that will be expected to be paid in the third quarter.
Natascha Viljoen: And in general, and from cost production, we will continue to mine as we know that there's a solution for the tailing stand and as we're working through those solutions. And then, we do have capacity in the plant to catch up to get that production through. And as we get that production through and declare the ounces, we will also declare our unit costs.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then what was the other one that - I think there was another asset that had some working capital change. It was Lihir that should unwind in Q4, I guess, when you ramp up but perhaps draw down again in Q3?
Karyn Ovelmen: The build-up in Q2 from Lihir, about a $75 million impact. So the average carrying cost per ounce of the stockpiles increasing from the initial low value that we had on the acquisition and a lot of that has to do with purchase price accounting adjustments.
Anita Soni: Okay. If I can ask just one more question. You reiterated your target of $2 billion from asset sales. Would you include this $500 million or so million you realized from these noncore within that $2 billion? Or is that excluding the - is that excluding those two assets, Lundin and the Batu Hijau?
Thomas Palmer: It's estimated that $2 billion that we're committed to excludes proceeds from Lundin and Batu Hijau. So we're committing to at least $2 billion from the divestment of the seven noncore assets.
Anita Soni: Okay. Thank you very much. That's it for my questions.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Anita.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Bob Brackett: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A bit in the weeds around Lihir. I am trying to understand the cadence of the shutdown and the guidance. So there's roughly five months left in the year. The shutdown is four months, but we should think about volumes as being sort of evenly split first half and second half. Are all 4 other claims being shut down? Or is it in series or parallel? Or how do I think about that cadence?
Thomas Palmer: Autoclave four is the largest of the four autoclaves, represents 40% of the throughput. So still at other three autoclaves running. You get some more recoveries running through those other three autoclaves. So the guidance for Lihir for the year respected that the largest of the autoclaves being down from 120 days shut. And then that you're obviously going to see that impact through predominantly the third quarter and into the start of the fourth. So we're certainly reflecting the impact of that shutdown for Lihir this year in sudden. I think Natascha said in her prepared remarks, the third quarter is similar to the second quarter, and then you'll see the fourth quarter higher as you get that autoclave up and running again with Lihir. It's not too slow of being 50-50 waiting for the year as a consequence of that.
Bob Brackett: Okay, that's very clear. Thanks for the color.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Bob.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian MacArthur from Raymond James. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian MacArthur: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. It has to do with reclamation. And obviously, there's some significant money going into Yanacocha. But as we think longer term and you talk about your $1.3 billion sustainable capital, are there other assets, I think out three to five years, that could have significant capital requirements, i.e., cash out the door as opposed to book accounting that I need to think about in my long-term cash flow analysis?
Thomas Palmer: Good morning Brian, certainly, when we think about as some earlier on the on our capital allocation, whether it be development capital or sustaining capital, if you think about this portfolio going forward having a reliable, predictable spend on sustaining capital to manage our business going forward, tailings dams and the like. And in terms of your broader part of that question as it relates to reclamation, remediation and the like, Karyn can you pick that one up?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. Just to clarify, that comes out of working capital. But those are actual payments for accruals that have already been recorded on the book. So the expense has already been taken for those. And so it's truly just cash outflow that has been for accruals that are already recorded on the balance sheet. The Yanacocha water treatment facility is the big one. No expectation of any significant changes to what we've been outlining as we go through. And as we've indicated, the spend will be approximately around 600 in total 2024, it goes up higher in '25, and that's above our historical outflow which was annually around $200 million to $300 million. So specific to the Yanacocha liability. We don't expect any other significant increases in that. If anything, we expect that to go back to historical levels beginning in '28-'29 time period.
Thomas Palmer: And then, Brian -- thanks, Karyn. In terms of our portfolio, certainly our go-forward portfolio, Yanacocha is an order of magnitude larger in that reclamation liability than any other of operations. So the other big mines, the Penasquito, the Boddington, the Nevada Gold Mines complex, order of magnitude lower. So it's got quite -- Yanacocha make in that respect.
Brian MacArthur: Great. That's what I thought, but I just figured I'd check. And the second part, I think you've been very careful you talk about when you're selling these assets, you want them to go to operators to maintain them going forward. Can I assume -- I'm going to assume that you're going to sell the reclamation liabilities to the buyers of this? And the second part of that, I guess, within those assets, the 1 that's highlighted in the 10-Q as maybe Porcupine has - potentially there are studies going on there about reclamation. And again, I'm just trying to -- I know you're very careful at this and reclamation is very important in the overall analysis. But I'm just trying to figure out how I should think about that.
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, the expectation is that as we divest these assets, and particularly when you're a competitive environment, which is what we're seeing, is that, that reclamation liability passes on to the new owner. And I'd also look to our track record as we've sold and rationalized and optimized our portfolio over the last 10 years. So that - that has been part of how we've gone about it. So what you've seen in terms of KCGM or a Red Lake or a [Bahi], similar process going forward.
Brian MacArthur: Great. Thanks very much.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Parkin from National Bank. The line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Parkin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups. One, Natascha. Can you just give me an idea of when we should expect that fourth autoclave to go down and at a service for the reline?
Natascha Viljoen: Mike, on the first of August, then its 120 days.
Michael Parkin: Okay. Perfect. And then a couple of questions for Karyn. Depreciation once rates on the Newcrest assets. I'm assuming they're not quite stable yet? Or have you finalized your purchase price accounting? And is it fair to kind of use Q2 rates on a go-forward basis? Or should we still expect those to kind of bounce around a bit?
Karyn Ovelmen: There'll be slight variability as we go through and adjust from a purchase price accounting perspective, but they should be, generally speaking, well set. I think we've had some -- there's some ups and downs in depreciation. They're higher a bit ounces mined at Penasquito, higher ounces mined and acid additions at Ahafo and increased as a result of the drawdown in either at Yanacocha. And all of that partially offset by the decrease that we -- as you report things as assets held for sale, you cease depreciation and amortization on those assets once you put that into that classification. So those will be the big variances as you go forward. But generally speaking, the Newcrest from a purchase price accounting perspective, it's been pretty settled.
Michael Parkin: Okay. And then a question on taxes. Are you making payments in installments based off your budget gold price? Or given that we're sitting up closer to - it was 2,400 12 hours ago, a little lower now. But obviously, a much more robust metal price environment. Are you truing up your payments? Or should we - this metal price environment sustains, should we start to think about catch-up payments in Q1, Q2 of next year to make up for the difference between budget and realize?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. It will start accruing in arrears as we go forward.
Michael Parkin: Okay. Thank you. That's it from me.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thank you, operator, and conscious, we're just at the top of the hour. So thank you all for your time for today, and have a good day, and we'll now look forward to catching up with you soon. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending this presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, the event is being recorded.  
 I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead. 
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Overman and will all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Can I please ask you to note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.
 Before we begin today, I'd like to take a moment to remember the 3 colleagues who sadly lost their lives working for Newmont this year. Ike Cobbina Morrison or Cobe, as he was known to his friends and colleagues was a dedicated and hard-working member of our Ahafo North project team and a natural leader. Cobe was a son, a husband, a father, a dear friend to many and he'll be greatly missed.  
 Rosana Ledesma was a daughter, a wife and a mother to a young daughter. Civil engineer Rosana was part of the original team that developed Cerro Negro 11 years ago and had aspirations to soon become a part time farmer in Argentina. And Daniel Ochoa. A son, a father to 2 young boys, a partner and a brother. He has been described by his colleagues as a strong team member with ambitions to further develop his career in mining.  
 The investigations into these tragic incidents have been led by 2 of our managing directors from different business units. With the support of teams of subject matter experts, to ensure that we truly understand the cause of the incidents. Our response will include implementing both immediate measures from early observations from the investigations as well as taking a structured approach to reinvigorate our safety systems, tools and in-field leadership activities that will all have a heavy focus on the quality of application.  
 Sadly, these recent incidents are a stark reminder of the need to maintain discipline and a relentless focus on safety fundamentals. The loss of Adam Kennedy, Cobe, Rosana and Daniel over the past 6 months has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we will continue to challenge ourselves to ensure that everyone working in our business goes home safely to their loved ones.  
 Turning to our quarterly results. We are firmly on track to deliver our 2024 guidance. We are pleased with our operational performance in the first quarter and remain focused on delivering consistent results as guided over the remainder of this year and beyond. I also want to reiterate the 4 key commitments that we have made to our shareholders. We continue to make progress on these commitments, and I'd like to provide a brief update on our first quarter achievements.  
 Starting, we're strengthening Newmont's position as the gold industry's recognized sustainability leader. Last week, Newmont published their 20th Annual Sustainability Report along with our third annual taxes and royalties contribution report, both providing a detailed and transparent look at our values-driven approach to sustainability, and the economic contributions we made in the jurisdictions and communities that we operate in. With this sustainable foundation in place, we have created the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions.  
 And from this portfolio, we produced 1.7 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,439 an ounce in the first quarter. We continue to expect these unit costs to improve throughout the year driven by both higher production in the second half and the delivery of synergies. I'd also note that in the first quarter, our go-forward Tier 1 portfolio produced 1.4 million ounces of gold at $1,378 an ounce.  
 Our Tier 1 portfolio also produced over 480,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc and included in this number is the 35,000 tonnes of copper that we produced and sold. We generated $776 million of cash flow from operating activities in Q1, including a $666 million reduction from working capital which Karyn will cover in a few minutes.  
 And when we exclude the $291 million onetime stamp duty payment we made in February in connection with our acquisition of Newcrest free cash flow for the quarter would have been $217 million. Our second quarter production and costs are expected to remain relatively consistent with the first quarter. And we continue to expect that our gold production will be weighted to around 53% in the second half of the year, remaining firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance on both production and cost basis.  
 In the first quarter, we also continued to progress the divestment of our 6 high-quality non-core assets this year. And this morning, we announced the sale of our Lundin Gold financing facilities, generating $330 million in cash proceeds and furthering our commitment to maximizing shareholder value by monetizing our non-core assets. We continue to maintain our exposure to Fruta del Norte through our equity interest in Lundin Gold.  
 Underpinned by the industry's strongest portfolio of gold and copper assets, we remain committed to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. As part of this, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We refinanced approximately $2 billion in debt related to the Newcrest acquisition. And we continue to advance our 4 key projects we have in execution, our second expansion at Tanami our new mine, Ahafo North and add 2 new block caves at Cadia. 
 And finally, turning to synergies. We remain firmly on track to deliver on our commitments. In the first quarter, we achieved $56 million in synergies, bringing the total delivered to $105 million since we closed our acquisition of Newcrest in November last year and building solid momentum towards our commitment of delivering a $500 million synergy run rate by the first of January 2026.  
 We have identified a series of initiatives, each with action plans and dedicated resources in place that have us on track to achieve a $335 million run rate by the end of this year, representing 2/3 of our $500 million synergy commitment and well ahead of the run rate we estimated when we announced this commitment in May of last year. Beginning with the core of this value delivery, we are seeing great opportunities emerging from our full potential work and we are just getting started.  
 At Lihir, we recently completed the first phase of full potential from which we have identified initiatives that will deliver more than $150 million of value close to double the synergy target we allocated to this new Tier 1 operation in our portfolio. I've just returned from Lihir and the key to extracting this value will be simplification. Following a very similar approach to the 1 we used at Penasquito 5 years ago. We have key members of our Newmont technical team on the ground in P&G supporting the site team to work on simplifying operations by focusing on the areas that would genuinely move the needle and stopping the non-value activities that have historically played this operation.  
 One example of this work is the work we are doing to debottleneck the materials handling and crushing circuits, which have been limited by Lihir's different oil properties, resulting in downtime from spillage, block shoots and block crushes. From this initiative alone, we expect to improve mill throughput and generate over $50 million in annual cash flow improvements and the future waves of opportunities already identified at Lihir we remain very excited about the untapped potential at this Q1 operation.  
 We are also well into the first phase of our full potential work at Cadia, Red Chris and Brucejack and have already identified several high-value opportunities that we will progress in parallel with the initiatives now underway at Lihir. For our supply chain synergies we have already realized close to $30 million from negotiating more favorable terms and pricing for materials and equipment as well as first consolidating and then renegotiating service contracts. 
 As we look ahead, we will continue to work closely with our key suppliers, leveraging our unmatched scale and global partnerships to seek improvements through negotiations and tenders over the course of the year.  
 Then turning to G&A. We have already achieved over 80% of the synergies that we committed to and we expect to exceed our $100 million G&A commitment by the end of this year. Most of our G&A synergies are coming from employee and contractor rationalization as we expected and to a lesser extent, from reductions in insurance premiums and other administrative fees. We look forward to realizing the significant production and cost benefits from our synergy work and we will continue to provide you with updates on our progress each quarter.  
 And with that, I'll now pass to Natascha and then Karyn for an update on our operational and financial performance for the quarter. Over to you, Natascha. 
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. After the loss of our colleagues at Ahafo North and Cerro Negro, Tom and I have spent time at these 2 sites. And with the project operational and investigations teams to get a firsthand understanding of the incidents to inform our global response to address our safety performance. In addition to Ahafo North and Cerro Negro, I had the privilege of visiting 5 of our 6 managed Tier 1 operations and spend time with our colleagues at Boddington, Penasquito, Akyem, Ahafo and Lihir as well as Yanacocha and Merian.  
 Our operations delivered a strong first quarter performance in line with our business plan and outlook for the year. With full potential underway at many of our sites, we remain confident in our ability to deliver safe and efficient production keeping us on track to deliver on the commitments Tom just described. I will cover the first quarter performance and outlook for our Tier 1 operations, starting with Tanami.  
 Tanami achieved planned production for the quarter and despite the heavy wet season in the Northern Territory that resulted in a 6-week closure of the Tanami track. In the first quarter, Tanami delivered higher tonnes mined from deeper underground and successfully completed its planned mold shutdown, positioning the site to deliver at least a 20% increase in gold production in the second quarter compared to the first.  
 At Boddington, the stripping of the current laybacks in both the North and South pits, continued to ramp up in the first quarter an investment that will bring forward stronger gold and copper grades starting in 2026. Total material moved increased over the fourth quarter due to improved tonnes mined and higher shovel productivity through the introduction of double-sided loading for our autonomous truck fleet, representing a major milestone for this ore fleet as the performance of this technology continues to go from strength to strength.  
 Penasquito delivered strong silver and lead production from the Chile Colorado set in the first quarter, as wide stripping continues to progress in the Penasco pit as previously indicated. As a result and as planned, we continue to expect gold production to be around 60% weighted towards the second half of the year at this world-class polymetallic mine. As we return to mining ore from the Penasco pit towards the end of the year, we will have access to these higher gold rate in the fourth quarter and into next year.  
 At Ahafo, we continue to optimize the processing circuits in the first quarter achieving a 37% increase in mill throughput compared to the prior quarter. The newly fabricated girth gear for 1 of the 2 SAG mills has arrived on site and we remain on track to replace this gear in May of this year. Once the new girth is commissioned, we anticipate a 10- to 20-day ramp-up period to reach full processing rights resulting in even stronger production levels at Ahafo into the second half of the year. Cadia continued to deliver strong gold and copper grades from the Cadia block caves in the first quarter. However, as factored into our guidance, these growths are expected to gradually decline over the remainder of the year as we transition from mining this cave to Panel Cave 2 3. And the work we are doing on both tailings rectification and expansion at Cadia, as mentioned last quarter is progressing well.  
 Tom and I visited a Lihir in early April, and we're impressed with the team's dedication and understanding and then implementing full potential work. As Tom said, this work will focus on simplifying the operation and being clear on the highest value option that will drive stability through the mining value chain. In addition, I want to flag that the largest of our 4 autoclave at Lihir will come down in quarter 3 for planned maintenance. 
 This shutdown is included in our guidance. During the first quarter, we continued to progress the 4 key projects we currently have in execution. At Ahafo North, we are advancing the construction of the processing plant and mine service facilities, along with wide stripping activities to allow the mining of ore to commence towards the end of this year. 
 We are diligently focused on progressing the project safely and efficiently and looking forward to delivering new low-cost ounces in the second half of 2025.  
 At the second expansion of Tanami our focus is on safely lining the lowest section of the shaft. And as you can see in the photo, we also continued to progress the construction of the underground infrastructure, including pouring the concrete foundation for the crusher chamber during the first quarter. 
 The 2 block caves at Cadia are both progressing well. We are advancing cave development to bring production online at Panel 2-3, and we are progressing underground development work for Panel Cave 1-2.  
 With that, I'll turn it over to Karyn to cover our financial performance and capital allocation priorities for the remainder of the year. 
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you Natascha. Let's get started with a review of the financial highlights for the quarter. Newmont delivered solid first quarter earnings, driven by strong production volumes and favorable metal prices. And as a reminder, results included only 2 months of our equity investment in Lundin Gold, which is accounted for 1 quarter in arrears.  
 In the first quarter, Newmont delivered $4 billion in revenue, at an average realized gold price of $2,090 per ounce and copper price of $3.72 per pound. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion, and adjusted net income of $0.55 per diluted share. 
 The most notable adjustment to net income for the quarter was a $0.43 add-back related to noncash impairments, non-core assets that were classified as held-for-sale as of March 31 under U.S. GAAP, assets that are classified as held-for-sale require a specific evaluation and need to be recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. 
 As a result of this evaluation, Newmont realized a noncash loss on assets held-for-sale, including the associated tax impact, of $485 million, primarily related to the Coffee project as opposed to assets that are currently operational.  
 As I indicated on our previous call, we anticipated minimal free cash flow in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of production and payments. We generated over $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter before a working capital reduction of $666 million. These changes in working capital included a one-time payment of $291 million related to stamp duty tax stemming from the acquisition of Newcrest, which was accrued for last year.  
 The building stockpiles primarily at our newly acquired sites of $193 million. A build in accounts receivable of $84 million, largely due to the ramp-up of operations at Penasquito in the first quarter and the timing of concentrate sales, and $59 million of reclamation spend primarily related to the construction of the Yanacocha water treatment facilities.  
 Yanacocha's ongoing closure advanced to the feasibility state at the end of last year and continues to address several complex closure issues, including water management, social impacts and tailings. This long-term water management solution will replace 5 existing water treatment facilities with 2. We commenced our construction of the Yanacocha water treatment plants as planned this quarter and expect spending to ramp up throughout the year and continue to adversely impact working capital.  
 Historically, Newmont's stand-alone reclamation spend averaged around $200 million to $300 million per annum, but we expect to spend around $600 million in 2024 and peak around $700 million in 2025 before beginning to decline in 2026. As previously mentioned, the first half of the year traditionally tends to produce adverse working capital changes. And this normal trend is expected to continue into the second quarter but with a slightly lower impact due to the regular timing of cash tax and interest payments.  
 And with production also weighted toward the second half of the year, we anticipate that the majority of our cash flow after working capital will be realized in the third and fourth quarter. positioning Newmont for a stronger second half of the year from both an earnings and cash flow perspective as we continue to focus on operational delivery. As Tom mentioned, we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance for production, costs and capital spend. 
 Production is expected to increase in the second half of the year. With the year's strongest performance anticipated in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strong grades at Penasquito, and Tanami. And unit costs will be closely correlated to production with the added benefit of full potential improvements and additional synergies realized in the second half of the year. 
 Capital discipline is a key focus area for us with our transformed portfolio. As mentioned on our last call, we continue to expect to invest an average of $1.3 billion per year of development capital in projects that will generate the highest returns, which we plan to provide more information about during our Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy, which focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet, steadily funding cash-generative capital projects and returning capital to shareholders. We maintained an investment-grade balance sheet and ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in total liquidity when including the cash reclassified to current assets held for sale. 
 We reinvested $317 million of development capital as we continue to advance our highest return projects from our deep organic pipeline. And finally, we declared a fixed common first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with the dividend declared during the fourth quarter.  
 Looking ahead, our capital allocation priorities have not changed and the cash flows generated from our operations and the proceeds from divestments will be allocated first, to have an approximate cash balance of $3 billion and then to reduce debt up to $8 billion over the next few years. Additionally, once we have line of sight on meeting our balance sheet targets, we intend to repurchase shares as we see value in buying back our shares. Maintaining a disciplined and structured approach to capital allocation throughout the year, will better position Newmont to deliver value to our shareholders.  
 With that, I'll hand it to Tom for closing remarks. Back to you, Tom. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. In closing, and as we look ahead to our priorities for the year, I'd like to reiterate our focus areas and key commitments. First, we will reinvigorate our established safety program and continue to strengthen Newmont's position as the gold industry's recognized sustainability leaders. 
 Second, we will continue operating the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. Third, over the next 2 years, we will deliver $500 million of annual synergies an additional $500 million in cost and productivity improvements and over $2 billion in cash from portfolio optimization. 
 And finally, we will drive a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation, creating a resilient and returns-focused future for our organization and our shareholders. From our go-forward portfolio, focused on Tier 1 gold and copper operations, we are well positioned to deliver on these commitments and more routing an attractive value proposition to new and existing investors during this unique time in the gold industry.  
 And with that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lawson Winder of Bank of America. 
Lawson Winder: Very nice quarterly results, and thanks for the update today. Can I start off by asking about asset sales. First of all, congratulations on realizing value from the sale of the lending stream and offtake. But with respect to that, first of all, when you receive that, when would you receive that cash, first of all? 
 And then second of all, will it be applied entirely to debt repayment? And then just looking at the asset sales more broadly, we've seen public indications of interest, fairly substantial interest in a team in Telfer, how would you describe the interest in the other assets? And what is your time line currently on thinking to be able to announce some transactions on these assets. 
Tom Palmer: I'll pick up the second part of your question and get Karyn to pick up the first in terms of the use of the proceeds from the Lundin transaction. So 6 high-quality non-core assets that are now held for divestment. So we've moved into that accounting classification, as Karyn talked to. 
 We have started a formal process on every 1 of those assets. So we're in Phase 1 in each of those -- each and every one of those assets. So we're in the price discovery phase. And there is a high level of interest across all of those processes, when we classify as assets held for sale, we are laying out a program as we've committed to, that we will work to divest those assets for fair value over the next 12 months. 
 Our preference is on cash, and that's what we've been looking to optimize value and cash. But the process has started on all 6 of them, and there's a high degree of interest, clearly getting an asset out of a Newmont portfolio is attracting a lot of interest in the marketplace. 
 Off to Karyn, in terms of your question around the use of the proceeds, they're coming to tranches Karyn then we process these. 
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. In terms of the use of proceeds, so the first payment second quarter, the second payment in the third quarter. Our capital allocation priorities are consistent as I discussed in my prepared remarks. And as we've indicated through 2024, the beginning part of the year, we will be drawing that cash as we go through the year. And so the first proceeds would be used to kind of replenish those cash balances as we go forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Natascha I wanted to ask you just on the year on the GEO side, you gave us the 47-53 on the gold front. Can you give us some guidance on the other metals, maybe just on the GEOs, how they progress at the year and particularly at Penasquito, please. 
Natascha Viljoen: Tanya, thank you for that question. I think starting off just broadly -- we will see -- we see higher contribution from Penasquito on GEO this year because we are with -- we are mining predominantly in the Chile Colorado pit that we know is higher in GEOs. If we look at our GEO production across the last 4 quarters, we will see that the GEO collection for silver would be around 9 million ounces a quarter in the order of about 28 million ounces or lead -- sorry, 29,000 tonnes and 58,000 tonnes of zinc across the 4 quarters. 
Tom Palmer: Just chipping in there, Tanya the -- getting the sort of coming out of Chile Colorado for the fourth quarter and the hit-back in Penasco, pretty flat on silver and lead, probably that's just a little bit more zinc maybe in the fourth quarter. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. No that's helpful. 
Tom Palmer: Copper is pretty steady through the year. Copper is pretty steady, Tanya, sorry. 
Tanya Jakusconek: And could I ask just still on the operational side, Natascha, you mentioned Lihir maintenance in Q3. Are there any other big maintenance that we should be aware of in your portfolio, particularly Nevada Gold Mines, Pueblo Viejo, Cadia? 
Natascha Viljoen: The only other areas would be Ahafo South we will be replacing the girth here, as I mentioned in the prepared comments and that will happen now in the second quarter. And then after that, we should see a ramp up back to normal production levels for Ahafo. You might remember Tanya we did say that we've reduced production out of Ahafo to make sure that we see the 2 mill streams running, but that will then return to normal production rates after that shut. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just finally on operations, and I'll leave it with someone else to ask. Just interested in as you -- the costs were quite good in Q1, even with the lower production level that you are going to expect better production going through the year. Anything on the inflationary front that you could flag for us any easing that you're seeing? Anything that you're seeing some benefits on? 
Natascha Viljoen: We've certainly seen some easing in 3 areas. We've seen it in contractor costs, diesel and explosives. But then we've also seen some increase in our scalable cost related to steel price and being also cyanide costs. The other x actor would probably energy in certain areas, we see a reduction in energy. That is, I think, quite surprising for us from 2023. 
Tom Palmer: And just a reminder [indiscernible] cost too. [indiscernible] cost is labor, and that's been pretty flat. 
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. 
Tanya Jakusconek: So just as I understood because it faded in and out, and I apologize for that. Just on where you're seeing reductions or easing is in contractor costs diesel and some consumables and energy? Is that a correct statement? 
Natascha Viljoen: Explosives specifically. And then the overall labor cost staying flat for own labor, that's about 50% of our cost makeup. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC Capital Markets. 
Joshua Wolfson: The team has painted a fairly rosy picture here on what the prospects are for asset dispositions -- and then also what the free cash flow outlook will look like absent some of these working capital headwinds. In that context, I'm wondering how flexible is the company's buyback policy -- and I'm noticing the stock being a lot higher today than it was when the plans were announced for this at the fourth quarter results. 
Natascha Viljoen: Thanks, Josh. Yes. As we go through the divestitures and as I've indicated, as our free cash flow picks up in the second half of the year. First priority is to ensure that we've got that -- our cash replenished on our balance sheet. And then there will be flexibility in terms of -- as long as we have line of sight in terms of debt reduction over the next 24 months, we would -- at that point in time, if we were in a position to start to think about executing on share buybacks. 
Tom Palmer: As a reminder, Josh, we've got an approved $1 billion buyback program ready to go if and when that scenario, Karyn maps out takes place. 
Joshua Wolfson: Okay. And then just sort of to clarify, when I look at even what a flat quarter would look like at much higher gold prices today. And again, without some of the larger working capital challenges, even maybe 1 or 2 of these asset dispositions would put you in line of sight of that. 
 So is it fair to say that the prospects for this buyback could happen sooner than maybe what the initial criteria were outlined for the balance sheet requirements? 
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. The expectations for the divestitures is that those will be executed within the next 12 months, hence, the conspiration on the balance sheet as assets held for sale. So expectation is through first quarter of 2025 that we will have executed or made decisions around the divestitures. And so the timing has continued upon that. 
Joshua Wolfson: Okay. And then sorry, just 1 question, if I can sneak in. I noticed the book value for the assets that are held for sale is $5.7 billion, which is quite a large number as compared to the $2 billion targeted. Any sort of comments there on how we should think about pricing or what the targets are effectively? 
Natascha Viljoen: No, not necessarily. I think from an accounting convention perspective and how they're reported from a GAAP perspective, will be obviously considered, I would assume by potential buyers, but in essence, the process of going through the commercial view of the assets and the value to the potential buyers that will produce something most likely different, whether it's up or down and associate versus what is recorded on our book from a GAAP perspective. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets. 
Jackie Przybylowski: Maybe I'll ask the first question on the full potential program. So I had the privilege of visiting Penasquito in March and definitely the team did a great job of outlining how the full potential program has benefited there. .
 And I know you're working very hard on rolling that out in some of the newer acquired assets like Lihir. Can you talk a little bit about how that's going so far? And what you're seeing in terms of achievements or maybe potential for future achievements? 
Tom Palmer: Yes. Jackie. I'll kick off and Natascha you might want to build on that a little bit degearing in there as well, and I want to chip in as well. We're further -- most advanced at Lihir and Lihir was where we saw the most opportunity, which is why we jumped into the -- literally on day 1. 3 main productivity and cost opportunities at Lihir. The 1 I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's really around consistent for the so that you can manage and address materials handling. 
 So sure, you've got the right balance of different ores so that you've got managing conveyer belts and block shoots and block crushers just to allow a big plan to get a good consistency coming into it. It's a key value driver. Asset management and improving plant availability and other plant losses, a real opportunity at Lihir just the basics of wood quality work management reliability engineering with the strength of the team that we have to support Lihir. 
 And then the third 1 is down into the pit improving mine efficiency and mine productivity. Just getting back to the basics of [ column ] blast, load haul through the mine. So very similar as we discussed at Penasquito in late February. 
 Move across to -- maybe just a touch on Cadia and Red Chris in particular. There's an enabler at Cadia, really important enabler in terms of resolving the tailings constraint, so understanding the work to rectify the tailings at Cadia and then expand those tailings to ensure you've got the tonnage capacity to support productivity improvements from both the mine and the processing plant underground, it's unlocking panel development. We're clearly opening up PC 2-3, so progressing the opening up of the draw points over the next couple of years in PC 2-3, ensuring that you're bringing on the development work for PC 1-2. 
 And then there's a fine balance between the mine and the processing plant. So ensuring that as we're doing that work, we're also unlocking our processing capability. We're still in that first phase of full potential, but we do identify some early quick wins. And I would argue that we are specialists in high-pressure grinding rolls at Boddington. 
 Over the last years, we have worked with those HPGRs and we have a very efficient way of operating and maintaining those -- that important crushing circuit such that we have regular visits to Boddington to understand how we both operate and maintain those HPGRs. So the opportunity for us to quickly get across to the HPGRs at Cadia, understand the power draw, understand the process control logic and optimize those HPGRs, a really early quick wins that we're getting after even before we finished the diagnostic phase. 
 And then I'll maybe touch on Red Chris, that processing plant is going to be there through the end of the open-pit mine and as we ultimately move into the block cave. So really focusing on the opportunities to stabilize mill operations. Again, the basics around reliability and having uptime of that facility with consistent feed. Then after you've stabilized and optimizing copper and gold recoveries and improving process controls so that you have a builders performing very well the remaining life of the open pit as you'd bring on the ore from the block cave in future years. Natascha, anything to add? 
Natascha Viljoen: No, I think that was a really comprehensive answer. 
Tom Palmer: Hopefully, Jackie, that gives you some sense of the excitement we have seen behind full potential and the confidence we have in that run rate through the end of this year, the run rate to the end of next year, why we've gone after the upside on top of that $500 million. 
Jackie Przybylowski: And that was a super-helpful answer. And maybe if I can ask a second question. Just going back to your divestment strategy, I know you have a number of assets that you're looking to sell in Canada specifically, but also, I guess, globally as well. Can you comment at all? Like do you have a preference of selling that that's in groups or bundles? Or are they all expected to be sold individually to different buyers? I don't know if you can make any comments on just how you're thinking about that? 
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie. As I mentioned in an earlier question. The process has started in all 6 assets. So we have engaged banks and are starting to process on all 6 assets. and we're in the process of price discovery through Phase 1, so an active interest. So we are getting a good feel for the level of interest in these assets and the competitive environment that we're hoping to enjoy. 
 And we're running 3 separate processes in terms of -- because they're in different locations. So there's a process for Telfer in the Australian context with a dedicated team looking after that. There's a process for a chin in the African organic context with a separate team looking after that. And there's a process for our North American assets, the 4 operations plus the Coffee project and the team getting after that. Fall being led by Peter Toth and Scott Langley, but up and running and very active, as I say, we're in Phase 1, but -- and quite excited about the level of interest and the competitive environment, which we're presenting these assets to prospective buyers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Parkin of National Bank. 
Michael Parkin: Just looking for a bit of additional color with Yanacocha and the water treatment plants. This might be a bit old, but -- just looking for what's the main driver there doing the 2 new plants versus the 5 existing one? Is it capacity or just the old ones don't have the technology kind of need to have been commented there. 
Tom Palmer: Mike, it is both capacity and technology. So just to paint a picture for you, we've been operating a mine in the oxide ore at Yanacocha for the better part of the last 30 years and disturbed at the top of the Andes an area that is equivalent of 3/4 of Manhattan to give you a sense of the scale of the disturbed land at the top of Andes, significant rainfall every year and a watershed right into both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. 
 So there is a very significant amount of disturbed land, very significant amount of water at the top of the Andes. But that water is acidic. So every drop water that touched that disturbed land, we need to capture, process, treat and then discharge to different qualities, so some instances the discharge needs to be to drinking water quality and some instances to agricultural standards as defined by the permits we have from the regulatory authorities in Peru. 
 So as has been accrued for within our closure liability. We were moving -- we have been moving into the stage of closure for Yanacocha that involves the construction of 2 large water treatment plants over the next few years. That then will treat water in perpetuity for real. These plants are designed to be there processing water and discharge of water forever. 
 So we're in the building of the plant phase now for a set of facilities that we operate for 3 decades out in front of us. Just to put this into perspective, size of those water treatment plants, we are treating -- we are designing and building these plants to treat 8,000 meters cubed per hour. That is a planned equivalent to treating the water required by a city the size of Seattle. So that's the size of the water treatment plants we're building up in Yanacocha. 
Michael Parkin: And the cost of those, I get -- that's all kind of flowing through this year and next year. Is that in your capital budget? Or is that running through the income statement? You normally have the... 
Tom Palmer: Sorry, Mike, I'll build on this. [indiscernible] capital or a sustaining capital. 
Natascha Viljoen: That's correct. It's accrued on our balance sheet as a liability. And you'll see that the $600 million that we expect to spend in 2024 is considered a current liability, but that you will not see that, as Tom indicated, flowing through sustaining or development capital. 
Michael Parkin: Okay. So is it more working capital changes as the current liability drops down? 
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. Consistent with the first quarter, you'll see that flow through working capital. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. 
Anita Soni: Just a little bit of a follow-on to what Mike has just asked. So with Yanacocha, originally, you guys took the provision of $2 billion, and it was basically the cost of treating this water in perpetuity. So at least that's what I -- that's what we understood or that you previously talked about. 
 So is this -- do we still have those costs as well? Or is this like once you've built this plant, you wouldn't have ongoing expenses in terms of the water treatment plant. Like I'm not quite sure if this is now additive to the original $2 billion. 
Tom Palmer: Soni, in terms of the provisions that we've had in our closure liabilities. That's all been there. So there's no new information there that's fully accounted for in terms of our closure liabilities for Yanacocha. And as part of that, there's always been the spend to build the water treatment plants, which takes place over '24, '25 to '26. 
 And then we -- then the cost to operate those water treatment plants. So they're looking at around $40 million to $50 million a year to operate these water treatment plants in perpetuity. The cost to both operate those plants and to construct those plants are included in our closure liability. 
Anita Soni: So what's that total closure liability now then? 
Tom Palmer: For Yanacocha is sitting at -- just looking at my number, it is sitting at about $4.8 billion. But in the -- sorry, the liability pass across to Karyn to cover the liability rather than me trying to pedal the balance sheet. 
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. It's just Thomas referred to, the total reclamation and remediation liabilities is around $6.6 billion. But for Yanacocha, it is the $1.7 billion that has been accrued for on our balance sheet. 
Anita Soni: Sorry. what are [indiscernible]... 
Tom Palmer: Yes, for the water treatment plant, Anita, so this Yanacocha has a bunch of other closure activities. You've got to reshape the reshape leach pads and waste dumps and tailings facilities. So water treatment is comparative to that, the total closure liability for Yanacocha it's $4.8 billion. 
Anita Soni: Okay. Got it. And then you mentioned it's taking place at over '24, '25 and then '26? Can you tell us what the number that we would see in working capital outflow in '26 would be. 
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. So as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the $600 million in terms of '24, peaking at $700 million in 2025 and then starting to come down from there in 2026. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Daniel Major of UBS. 
Daniel Major: Sorry, I'll keep a quick on time. Two questions. One, just on following up on the working capital. and looking at your Slide 10 in the presentation, you've talked at length on the reclamation payments. But can you give us a sense of any other key moving parts we should expect in the coming quarters and where you would expect the net balance change year-on-year to be from a cash working capital perspective, including the stamp duty or excluding it whichever? 
Natascha Viljoen: Sure. So the only additional stamp duty we'll have is in the third quarter of approximately $30 million. You'll see some additional seasonal changes as we head into second quarter as it relates to cash taxes as well as interest from a cash perspective, those will flow through in the second quarter as well and you'll see higher the reclamation liabilities, the cash outflow associated with that as we go through 2024. 
 And then in addition to that, you'll see the traditional timing as it relates to sales and inventory changes as we go through the year. 
Daniel Major: So if you stand now, what would you expect the net change to be over the full year, Bill, in terms of that net build in working capital? 
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. That really depends on the timing in terms of that as well as, of course, pricing as we go through 2024. 
Daniel Major: Okay. And then just second one, you talked -- detailed a lot of the progress you've made since the integration in Newcrest. And these kind of deals, I guess, there's always positives and negatives. What's  the toughest part, what's been the most challenging or most difficult part of the integration so far? 
Tom Palmer: I'll pick that one up. The things by far away, Daniel, is the tragic loss of Adam Kennedy's life at Brucejack on the 20th of December last year. And as you reflect upon the integration, you reflect upon what things could we have done differently, what decisions could we have made differently that would have effect to Adam being killed that day at Brucejack. 
 I think, as you've said in some of our remarks as well, I think it's stepping back from the loss of Adam and safety are the 2 areas that we're working through diligently tailing facilities, and we've talked about [indiscernible], talked about [indiscernible] and a little bit around Red Chris so just bringing those tailing facilities into the Newmont standard and ensuring that we have the appropriate rigor and discipline around those to manage them here and now and ensuring that we ship at those going forward that they have the appropriate standard. 
 And then the third one would be bringing the ore body knowledge levels up to a Newmont standard so that we've got really robust orebody knowledge underpinning our mine plan. So that will be the 3 areas where there's been, I guess, the hard work. I think if I step back from that with the perspective of having lived through a similar integration and transaction 5 years ago. I think when I step back from those 3 areas, I think the integration has gone very well. And I think we had the benefit of being able to apply the lessons we learned from integrating the 5 Goldcorp assets back in 2019 to this exercise, and that's put us in good stead. 
Operator: We've had a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC. 
Anita Soni: Yes. Sorry, I got cut off there before the end of the question. But I was hoping -- I'm assuming that the 2026 spend for Yanacocha water treatment would be $400 million. I think you said it was $1.7 billion just for the buildup of those plants. So you're doing $600 million and then $700 million, so the remainder would be $400 million. Is that correct? 
Natascha Viljoen: Yes. The expectation is that this will be commissioned in 2027, and there'll be obviously some continued as Tom said, continued approximately around $50 million a year associated with that going forward. 
Tom Palmer: So we certainly see the step up through those 3 years. And then back to -- as best you can predict that far in the future back to the sort of normal long-run levels for closure and reclamation activities. 
Anita Soni: Okay. I'm going to -- so the second question that I wanted to ask was about Cerro Negro. So definitely unfortunate that 2 people lost their lives. I did want to ask a little bit about -- does it have anything to do with long-term structural support there? I mean these guys were a gentleman and a lady were within the Mine Technical Services group. So not -- a little bit unexpected for that group for that to happen. So I was just trying to find out if you had any color on that? 
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita. I'd ask Natascha to comment. 
Natascha Viljoen: It's absolutely not structural. So from a geotechnical point of view and from a quality of asset point of view, very high quality and no material geo tech challenges for us this was procedural by nature. So definitely not linked to any long-term predictions. 
Tom Palmer: And as we close out our investigation, we will share those lessons widely with the industry so as we opportune, we will. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks. 
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for your time, and please enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks, everyone. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings and 2024 Guidance Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Thomas Palmer: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge our friend and colleague, Rob Atkinson, our Chief Operating Officer for the past 5 years, Rob will leave Newmont in early May, although his legacy will endure. Through his visible self-leadership, Rob has driven our fatality risk management program, achieving 5 years fatality-free performance. Throughout the pandemic, Rob navigated our operations through challenges, including periods of care and maintenance, order closures and vaccine implementation. Rob also represented the very best of our values when he guided Peñasquito through 2 major challenges: resolving a community blockade in 2019 and an unjustified strike last year. In both situations, Rob found sustainable solutions that protected a long-term value of Newmont. Over the last 5 months, Rob and Natascha have conducted a thorough handover of accountabilities and Rob will remain with us to support [indiscernible] before finishing up and heading back to the U.K. to spend more time with family. Before we get started, it is with great sadness that I share the tragic news regarding a fatal incident at our recently acquired Brucejack operation on December 20 last year. I'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague Adam Kennedy. Adam was only 44 years old. He was a partner, a son, a brother, and uncle, a best friend and a valued colleague. Our condolences go out to Adams loved ones during this difficult time, and we are again reminded how important it is to maintain a sense of chronic unease when it comes to the safety of everyone who works at Newmont. [indiscernible] fatality is totally unacceptable. We fully understand the fatality risk in our industry and the critical controls that need to be in place at all times to manage them. So we have been taking the time to conduct a safety reset across all Newmont sites, not just the 5 new Newmont operations with a laser focus on the implementation of our fatality risk management system. This reset work includes training delivered by our line leaders, our managing directors, our general managers and our senior health and safety leaders. Training on our fatality risk management standards, and our critical control verification process. We are also concluding our thorough investigation into this tragic incident which is being led by David Thornton, the Managing Director of our Africa business unit. We are applying the lessons learned from this investigation at all of our managed operations globally and we will share them widely with our mining industry peers. Nothing is more important that our commitment to the health and safety of our workforce, and we are determined to create an environment with every person working at Newmont across all locations return home safe and well to their families and loved ones at the end of each and every shift. Turning to our performance in 2023. Newmont finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, putting us in line with the revised stand-alone outlook that we issued following the resolution of the strike at Peñasquito. In summary, we produced 5.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,444 an ounce. In addition to gold, we produced nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc over the course of the year. This performance enabled us to deliver $4.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA returned the $1.4 million to shareholders and end the year with liquidity above $6 billion. In a few minutes Natascha and I will explain on how we expect to improve upon this performance in 2024 and beyond, with a focus of delivering meaningful value to our shareholders. But before we do that, I would like to describe how we're transforming our business into a unique collection of the world's best gold and copper operations and projects following last year's transaction. When we announced our binding agreement to acquire Newcrest in May last year, we outlined a powerful value proposition built around 4 key commitments. First, to set the new sustainability standard and strengthened Newmont's position as the gold sector recognize sustainability leader. Second, to create the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. Third, to deliver $500 million of annual synergies and realize over $2 billion in cash from portfolio optimization. And finally, to continue driving a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation. After closing the transaction on November 6 last year, the integration of the 5 new operations into our Newmont operating model has been progressing very well. And as we enter this critically important year of integration and transformation, I'll be holding myself and my executive leadership team accountable for delivering on these commitments and this will be our key focus in 2024. To support this work, earlier today, we announced 4 key actions that together will enhance our ability to deliver on our clear and consistent strategy. First, we plan to divest 6 high-quality but noncore assets this year. From this point forward, our world-class portfolio will consist entirely of Tier 1, an emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. And it will have a significant exposure to growth in copper and gold from our industry-leading organic project pipeline. Second, we provided our 2024 and 5-year outlook, getting a clear picture of the work we're doing today to expand margins and appropriately sequence our projects to deliver sustainable value. Third, with the clarity, simplicity and focus that our Tier 1 portfolio provides, we have committed to deliver a further $500 million in cost and productivity improvements across the entire portfolio. And these improvements are over and above our synergy commitment from the Newcrest acquisition. We expect to hit this $500 million annual run rate of improvement by the end of 2025. And finally, we announced a balanced shareholder return framework, consisting of $1 per share annualized base dividend and a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Our go-forward Newmont portfolio is focused on Tier 1, gold and copper, operations and projects located in the world's most favorable mining jurisdictions. And it has 4 key features. First, it contains 10 Tier 1 operations, representing all the half of the world Tier 1 guidelines in the Newmont portfolio. Second, it has 3 emerging Tier 1 operations that each has a clear path for growth. And we have the opportunity to create a Tier 1 district in British Columbia, a district in which Newmont will be operating for at least the next [indiscernible]. And third, it has an unmatched organic development pipeline with 6 large-scale top of gold projects. And fourth, underpinning our Tier 1 portfolio, is the industry's most robust foundation of reserves and resources. Going forward, Newmont has the industry's largest gold resource base and we also have the largest base of copper resources in the gold industry. To put these numbers into perspective, Newmont has an almost 30% large gold reserve resource base than our nearest peer. And we have a 40% larger copper reserve resource base than our nearest gold peer. No other gold producing in the world can offer the depth and quality that Newmont's Tier 1 portfolio can today. Later on, I'll provide a little bit more color about Newmont's longer-term outlook and the exciting gold, copper opportunities ahead of us. But first, I'd like to step back and give some insight into how we are framing the year ahead. 2023 brought with a number of unique challenges, which are now certainly behind us. The 120-day labor dispute at Peñasquito, asset integrity issues that were inherent in the original design of equipment at Ahafo and wildfires in Canada impacting Éléonore. Those 3 events, mean that our final production number did not reflect the full capability of our assets. As we emerge on the other side of these events, I am proud of the decisions that we took to protect the long-term interest of our company rather than looking to seek short-term experience solutions. However, I'm also not happy with the underlying level of our operating performance. We have the opportunity to improve our compliance to mine plants to improve our fixed and mobile equipment reliability and to improve our mill throughputs and recoveries. So our focus to '24 will be on safely integrating new teams, new operations in our Newmont operating model and culture, transforming our portfolio, underlying the groundwork for sustainable operating performance, margin expansion and strong returns. Finally, this morning, we also announced that we have extended the completion date and increased the project capital cost for our Tanami 2 expansion project. In the second half of last year, we completed the concrete lining of the top half or 700 meters of this 1.5 kilometer deep production shaft. This milestone gave us the opportunity to assess the condition of the known overbreak and ground conditions at the very bottom of the shaft as well as incorporate the lessons learned providing the top half of the shaft into the cost and schedule for the run home. We have critically assessed a number of options to safely address the line overbreak and line the lower section of the shaft. This work included key third-party reviews before we landed on a method. And it was this methodology and subsequent decision that an informed the cost and schedule update we provided today. Although I'm not happy with the extension of time and cost, I am confident that we have chosen a method that is safe and will ensure the shaft construction is of the quality necessary to rely with service Tanami prolific ore body for many, many years to come. So with that, I'll hand it over to Natascha to walk you through our operational priorities in 2024 and what we are doing to ensure that we deliver on our commitments this year. Over to you, Natascha.
Natascha Viljoen: Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Since joining Newmont in October, I have visited 14 of Newmont's 17 managed operations. And I've been really impressed by the quality of the assets, the dedication of our people and the commitment from our operational leaders to drive safe and profitable production. Now before I begin, I'd like to provide a brief introduction to the operational team focused on integration and value delivery in 2024. As mentioned last quarter, within our global operating model, we have 6 regional business units, each headed up by a world-class experienced Newmont leader where you can see on this slide. This scalable integrated operating model enables alignment across our operating leadership team while also empowering our managing directors to apply the extensive local and technical knowledge and draw on the global functional expertise to lead each unique operation. To support our operations from the project execution side, we have a dedicated restructured project delivery team. This team of subject matter experts is working across the full spectrum of our organic pipeline, including studies, project development, construction and commissioning of projects. By strengthen our operating model with block driving capability and an understanding of industry-leading practices in project development. This year, we will have a laser focus on the performance of our 11 managed operations in our go-forward portfolio, while also guiding our 6 noncore assets through a safe and productive process for divestment. As we work to deliver efficiency and reliability from our global portfolio, we are committed to progressing our 4 key projects in execution and keeping them on track in 2024. As a result, we are entering the year with a strong focus on integration and the safe delivery of our targets. Our success in 2024 will be largely determined by the performance of our 6 managed Tier 1 operations, Boddington, Tanami, Penasquito, Ahafo, Lihir and Cadia, not underestimating the significant impact of the delivery from the full portfolio of operating assets.  I will also separately touch on telephone and how we are ensuring [indiscernible] integrity at this new to Newmont operation. We're very clear on the key priorities to integrate and deliver 2024 and how this set up operations in the next 5 years. And I will touch on some of these in each of the Tier 1 managed operations. At Boddington, we are progressing the stripping of the current laybacks in the North and South pits as planned, with improved productivity from our fully autonomous [indiscernible] fleet. At our poly metallic mine Peñasquito, our focus is on delivering strong silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit, and continuing wide stripping in the Peñasco pit to deliver higher gold grade in 2025. At Ahafo, we remain on track to replacement girth gear in the second quarter to maximize [indiscernible] rates.  At Tanami, we are improving material movement through the decline as we progress deeper underground. [indiscernible] team will be focused on simplifying the mine plan and improving asset reliability. And at our other Newmont operation Cadia, we are commissioning the next block cave and progressing some important tailings rectification and expansion work to sync up for the next decade of all feed. We have full potential teams on the ground at coherent Cadia, actively working through our diagnosis phase and designing the initiatives to extract value and deliver the opportunities identified. So taking these key priorities into account, we anticipate that the production will be around 53% weighted towards the second half of the year as we return to full pricing rates at Ahafo, reach higher grades for the liberator ore body at Tanami and site integrated due to Newmont sites into the Newmont operating model. I'm touching briefly on Telfer, a noncore operation in Australia. We are focused on remediating [indiscernible] and fracs detected at the tailing storage facility in December, where we stopped the mill to complete the first phase of remediation work. In early February, we temporarily restarted the plant while evaluating options for further remediation of an [indiscernible] tailing facility and we'll provide an update on that work on our first quarter earnings call. And with a focus on fatality risk management, we expect that work and full potential implies, we remind fairly on track to deliver on our commitments this year. On top of delevering in 2024 operationally, we are working to bring forward new low-cost ounces from the 4 key projects we have in execution. These projects include the second expansion at Tanami, as Tom just covered. Our focus is on slightly aligning the lower section of the shaft and continuing to construct and crushing and combined infrastructure underground. Two block cave projects at Cadia to recover both gold and copper, where we have just let first ore as we ramp up the first of these caves. And our new mine, Ahafo North, where we are making good progress on the construction of the [indiscernible] and other supporting infrastructure, along with wire stripping to allow us to start accessing the ore for stockpiling.  When this new and very exciting mine is combined with the underground potential of Subika, Apensu and Awonsu, we have a Tier 1 Ahafo district and we'll be capable of producing around 850,000 ounces of gold per year out to and beyond 2015, which would make it one of the world's top gold mining districts by any measure. Now bringing all of this together, as we focus on the integration and size delivering this year, we expect our Tier 1 portfolio to produce around 5.6 million ounces of gold and an all-in sustaining cost of $1,300 per ounce. Combined with the very significant 1.9 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum. Our unit costs are expected to improve compared to 2023 due to steady production of net volumes and the delivery of synergies and full potential improvements with the lowest unit cost coming from Newmont's managed Tier 1 portfolio. Our capital reinvestments remains in line with the pre-acquisition spending levels as we continue to focus our disciplined delivery and a balanced approach to capital allocation. And with a stable reduction and structured reinvestment, we are strongly positioned to integrate and deliver on our commitments in 2024, setting the stage to future proof these world-class assets with benchmark performance and meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Natascha. Moving up to foundation we are establishing in 2024 that Natascha just covered. I'd now like to provide a bit of color around the opportunities that we are seeing from our go-forward portfolio. We will continue to optimize the performance of our mature Tier 1 operations and our new to Newmont assets. At Boddington, the stripping that we are doing today will bring forward strong gold and copper grades starting in 2026, all supported by the gold industry's only fully autonomous whole fleet. At Tanami, the completion of the second expansion will provide efficient access to ore at depth and open up this prolific underground ore body in 2027 and beyond. At Penasquito, the stripping that we are currently doing will bring forward a harder proportion of gold ounces from the Penasco pit, balancing with the strong production of silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit. At Ahafo, we are building out district potential with new low-cost ounces from both underground and open pit at Ahafo South, and our new mine, Ahafo North coming online in 2025. At Cadia, we will commission our second block cave in this time frame bringing forward higher gold and copper grades whilst in parallel, leveraging our full potential program to improve their reliability and throughput. And finally, simplifying the [indiscernible] mine plan is expected to deliver a strong improvement in gold production as we reach higher grades from Phase 14a. As I mentioned earlier, with a clear line of sight into the Tier 1 managed operations in our portfolio, we have identified $500 million of additional cost and productivity improvements over and above our synergy commitments. So taking everything into account. Over the next 5 years, we expect to deliver growing gold production driven by the completion of the laybacks at both Boddington and Peñasquito, the new ounces from Ahafo North, the completion of the second expansion at Tanami and both block caves at Cadia and binding improvements combined with higher grades [indiscernible]. And on top of this improving gold production, Newmont will produce a significant amount of copper, along with silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum with our global diversified Tier 1 portfolio. Driven by this high metal production and with a focus on improving costs, we expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs bringing our go-forward portfolio down to $1,150 per ounce by 2027. For development capital, we are applying a pragmatic and methodical approach to our project work to ensure we are efficiently bringing forward opportunities that are aligned with our strategy, also remaining disciplined with our capital allocation priorities. We expect to spend an average of $1.3 billion per year on development capital, driving healthy competition for investment has been closed out all large projects we have in execution and bring forward the next wave of profitable production from our organic project pipeline. Newmont is supported by the deepest and best project pipeline in the gold industry and we will manage it with discipline and rigor to ensure that the most value-accretive opportunities are advanced at the right time and to the right order. We have 3 world-class copper, gold projects in our pipeline ramped up behind the 4 projects we have currently in execution. Moving underground with the block cave at Red Chris developing the [indiscernible] block cave and processing the sulfide ore at Yanacocha. And then when we look beyond those projects, we have 3 exciting long-term opportunities to further diversify into copper, Galore Creek, Pueblo Viejo and Norte Abierto. Over the next 10 years, the amount of copper is expected to increase significantly. And based on current copper production trends, the world can expect to experience around a 10 million tonne shortfall on this critical metal by 2035. Bridging this gap will require significantly more copper mines, copper recycling and enhanced copper hedging processes, creating an exciting opportunity to Newmont to help meet this demand with the organic copper exposure we have in our portfolio, whilst continuing to provide unparalleled exposure to gold and its enduring value. And with that, I'll hand it over to Karyn to talk through our balanced capital allocation strategy.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Tom. Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by 3 priorities: working in [indiscernible], these priorities maintain the financial flexibility necessary to reinvest in our business with the goal of generating long-term sustainable free cash flow, in turn, positioning us to return capital to shareholders through our balanced shareholder return framework. Beginning with financial flexibility, the first of our 3 priorities. We intend to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet with gross debt of up to $8 million and liquidity of $7 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash. And by maintaining a strong balance sheet, we can ensure we have the ability to steadily fund cash-generative capital projects, all while returning capital to shareholders. As announced this morning, we have 6 assets currently classified as non-core. The anticipated proceeds from these divestments, along with free cash flow from operations, will cycle through our capital allocation priorities beginning with enhancing our financial strength and flexibility. Divestiture proceeds will first be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance of approximately $3 billion and will then be applied to reducing debt to $8 million or below. Our initial debt target of $8 billion is to achieve return -- we intend to return both free cash flow from operations and divestiture proceeds to our shareholders, which I will touch on in more detail in a minute. Moving to sustainable investments. As Tom and Natascha mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect meaningful production growth from a volume wise, low-cost operations as we invest an average of $1.3 billion of development capital into projects that will generate the highest returns. The third priority of our capital allocation approach is a balanced shareholder return framework designed to return capital to shareholders through our base dividend and share repurchases. To be clear, we are not yet where we want to be in terms of generating free cash flow to return to our shareholders, but I believe we have the right framework in place to return an increasing amount of capital as our operational and financial performance improves. Our balanced shareholder return framework begins with an annualized base dividend of $1 per share, an amount that will remain fixed and currently equates to a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. We expect to be able to pay the base dividend from free cash flow over time. Our dividend is subject to approval from our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Historically, our free cash flow generation has been weighted towards the back end of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2024 as our production profile and synergy realization is expected to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. In addition, free cash flow generation in the first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the payment of safe duty tax related to the acquisition of Newcrest. Stamp duty was accrued in the fourth quarter and paid in February. As necessary, we will use the flexibility of our balance sheet from the base dividend through the quarters with the annualized $1 per share dividend expected to be ultimately funded with free cash flow. Additionally, our Board has authorized $1 billion share repurchase program. As the liquidity and debt parameters I defined earlier are satisfied, we intend to repurchase shares in line with our free cash flow and asset sale proceeds. To reiterate, our free cash flow and proceeds from divestments will be prioritized as follows. The first dollar will be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance, the second will be applying to reducing debt to $8 billion, and the third will go towards share repurchases.  Our goal portfolio positioned us to improve margins and performance over time, funding our capital allocation priorities and allowing us to reward our shareholders directly with returns of capital. And we believe reducing debt and returning capital to shareholders creates attractive value proposition for [indiscernible] existing investors while also improving the company's financial position over the long term. I'll now turn it back to Tom for closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. Newmont go forward Tier 1 portfolio sets the new standard for gold and copper mining and provides our shareholders with exposure to the highest concentration of Tier 1 assets in the sector, located in the most favorable mining jurisdictions, and with improving cost profile to maximize margins and generate strong free cash flow. The industry-leading growth optionality in copper and gold through disciplined reinvestment and project execution and a balanced shareholder return framework. As we look forward to this very important year of integration and transformation, I am very confident in the quality of our assets and the capability of our team to deliver on our commitments and justify our position as the benchmark gold equity. This year, we'll also be continuing to work on transforming our go-forward portfolio and importantly, building out the strategic and life-of-mine plans for each of our managed sections. And I look forward to updating you on the longer-term potential of this world-class portfolio at our Capital Market Days in the second half of this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from the line of Josh Wolfson of RBC.
Joshua Wolfson: Thank you very much, operator. I guess I'll limit my questions to just the single one. On the Newcrest reserve front, it looks like the overall totals for gold declined by about 1/3. And I understand the differences were primarily due to reporting changes under SEC guidelines. I'm wondering how we should be thinking about the prior reserves that were there and whether the company would expect to incorporate these as part of their reserve base in the future or if this is something different than that?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Josh, and good morning. As we did the work to bring the Newcrest reserves and resources into the Newmont standards. We obviously have a tighter set of rules in terms of what makes a Newmont reserve and a Newmont resource. As the numbers came together, once we have the full transparency in the reserves of resources that were very consistent to what we assumed when we did our due diligence back in April and May. There's a number of moving parts to it, Josh, and talking to the team over the last couple of days and reflecting back on what we did with Goldcorp 5 years ago. I think giving each of you the opportunity to sit down in a more detailed session where we can have our IR team, along with Don Doe, who governs that old process, we can take you through some of those detailed questions and ensure that we're able to adequately answer where you might be seeing most differences. But we -- the works starts, we've obviously debate that statement. So I'd certainly look for our Investor Relations team to set those meetings up and we can spend some quick time taking you through that if that's okay.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Lawson Winder of Bank of America.
Lawson Winder: Thank you very much, operator. And thank you all for the update today. Could I ask about the capital return and how you thought about that? And essentially, what it looks like you've done to me is you shift the capital from dividends to share buybacks. So what drove that decision to make that transfer of capital return?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. I'll kick off, and I get Karyn to build. When you look at we're transformed [indiscernible] with the acquisition of Newcrest. So as we shaped the Newmont go-forward portfolio. So that Tier 1 portfolio is very different from what Newmont was before. So once we determine that go-forward portfolio then we step back to look at the appropriate capital allocation approach or strategy in the context of a portfolio of Tier 1 assets with a very long life. We looked at our balance sheet in terms of the debt that we brought on board following the transaction. We looked at the number of shares that we issued to do this transaction, and they are important factors when you sit down and look at our capital allocation framework. So you step back from that, first and foremost, is ensuring that we are putting money on the balance sheet. We're getting the cash to the parameters that Karyn talked about, building that cash up in order to pay down debt, the targets we're going to really important step that we do need. We're really clear in terms of amount of money we'll put towards reinvestment in the business and seeing that average of $1.3 billion and a $1 per share based dividend is something that is fixed, and you put in the bank in terms of what you're going to expect from Newmont. So then it becomes what do we do with any dollar over and above having met those requirements with cash proceeds coming in and any net free cash flow that we generate in the context of us having reissued shares and a $1 billion share buyback gives us the vehicle to return any variable component or additional free cash flow. So it was very much in the context of looking at the portfolio that we have transformed to and where we want to take that, that portfolio too in terms of its capital allocation settings. Karyn, do you want to build on that?
Karyn Ovelmen: Sure. Just a follow on to that. And then also, as we looked at this portfolio, it's linking the return of capital directly to our free cash flow realization. And then also just in terms of consistency, in terms of where we were with 2023 from the absolute dollar amount of the dividend, the base dividend that we paid at $1.60. It was around $1.4 billion. So our base dividend today going forward, [indiscernible] with a new share count is around 1.2 billion. We believe that's the right level for our free cash flow generation as we're going forward. As we couple that with a variable portion of the return now that will be a part of a share repurchase, which is consistent with the new equity that we just issued in terms of our ability to start to bring that down as well.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Anita Soni of CIBC.
Anita Soni: Tom, Karyn and Natascha. So my first question is with respect to the metallurgical changes at Peñasquito. Could you talk about that? And what exactly happened there? What years does it impact? And I noticed there was a reduction in reserves at Peñasquito on gold and silver. And I just wanted to seek more clarity on that.
Thomas Palmer: I'll kick off and then Karyn also here with Natascha and Rob, if you want to chip in folks. I think probably a couple of factors there, Anita. I think we've drilled some 40 kilometers of infill drilling across Peñasquito over the last period of time and then looking at the impacts that may have in terms of reserves and resources. And there a layback in the Peñasco pit is cut back 10. It's scheduled out into the 2030s. But as we did that infill drilling, didn't see the level of metal that we issued this week as we got that great entity of drilling. And so you see that reflected in terms of reserve and resource numbers. It doesn't mean that we can't get that layback into the system. And our real focus of Peñasquito is curing that we roll up our leads tighten our focus and look to improve the operational efficiencies at that big mine. And I think there's still plenty of upside there. So I think about the time frame out in front of us and the opportunities to improve cost of productivity in Peñasquito, I could say pathways to bring those ounces back in again as we focus on that challenge with a good decade out in front of us. The second area, [indiscernible] as we looked at the block models and reconciliations over the last period of time, we'll see reconciliations for silver, lead, zinc sitting between 5% and 10% over, so 105% to 110%. Gold was coming in at around 90%, 95%. So as we've updated our mine plans, we incorporated the reconciliations that we've been seeing within our block model. So you're seeing some of that affect [indiscernible] as well.  The governance of that block model we managed separately, it's governed separately from the development of the mine plans. So as we looked at those reconciliations, we may do private updates to the block models.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then my other question is also on operational technical in nature. I'm not quite sure what underbreak and overbreak means. Can you just explain it in layman's terms? What's happening at Tanami? I mean, my understanding, I think it looks like it looks there was an issue with -- when you were drilling the shaft, and there was I guess, collapsed a little bit? Or is that a mistaken assumption, like what's going on at Tanami?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Anita. So maybe with the Tanami production shaft in a little bit of perspective is 1.5 kilometers deep. And the overbreak, which is the predominant challenge we're working through is at the very bottom of that shaft. So it's at the bottom a couple of hundred meters. To throw out -- we throw out a 1.5 kilometer deep shaft is 3 [indiscernible] towers top-to-tail underground at middle to Northern [indiscernible]. So there's that very bottom of the shaft that we've seen the overbreak. As we raise board versus the shaft, it's a 6-meter diameter shaft as we've baseboard shaft and you're leaving that parent through rock sitting there, actually they come from the top and line down at the very bottom of the shaft within some broken ground. So you do get some raveling and some ground breaking off into the very bottom of the shaft. And as that relaxed that has broken out in areas to in some areas, double the diameter of that shaft at the very bottom. It's the nature of underground mining and shaft sinking that you'll hit pockets of ground that's got some poor conditions. And so we've seen that what we call overbreak, which means that with the shaft is wider, then you can safely reach out to do rock bolting, [indiscernible] creating and the like to be able to then put the lining on. So as we stepped through that 10 years ago, if you were doing that work, in the shaft sinking industry, there would have been some very unsafe practices to be able to fill in that area in order to be able to bring back into 6-meter diameter and then line that shaft. We're not prepared to do that. So we first understood the level of overbreak and then developed a range of different methodologies for how we could safely rectify that, had them assessed by third parties and then landed on the one that we believe we can send [indiscernible] down back depth to that location to do that work. So we have a methodology now that will involve safe rock bolting from a galloway, safe shaft creating from the galloway and then we'll fill that bottom section of the shaft. That's a couple of hundred meters with concrete and then we'll [indiscernible] that bottom section and then we'll come down and line that section alongside the rest of the shaft. And we will have a shaft that will be assembled safely to the appropriate quality to then run for decades to service the ore body at depth. So that's the process we've been through to determine how to appropriately fill the overbreak areas. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity.
Anita Soni: It does. I -- that part is what I thought. That's typical when someone hears a word overbreak. It's the phrase underbreak that you also used, which -- that's what confused me. Yes. Could you explain that...
Thomas Palmer: There's not a huge part of that shaft. There are certain areas where the [indiscernible] has moved past in hard rock or whatever it might be and you've got a bit of material protruding into the diameter of where you want to line the shaft. So it's really coming through and that being able to clean back break back to the 6-meter diameters. So you've got the appropriate dimension and tolerance about [indiscernible] poor concrete to perform the wall. So there are certain sense where you haven't been able to read out the full 6 [indiscernible] diameter. And so you have to do some rectification both...
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Daniel Major of UBS.
Daniel Major: Questions around some of the Newcrest assets observing, I guess, from a distance company for quite a long time. Two things, the Lihir asset has been a perennial underperformer ever since Newcrest barter, why do you think you're going to be able to deliver better results and more consistent results at Lihir than the Newcrest were able to over the last 10 years or so?
Thomas Palmer: Daniel, it's probably it is morning to you, I suspect. Lihir is a big asset developed by, [indiscernible] Mining and then Newcrest picked it up kind of a dozen years ago. A big mine like Lihir is best placed in a big Tier 1 portfolio, we were able to balance out the ebbs and flows of a large complex mine. So first and foremost, you can with Lihir in a balanced portfolio with 9 other Tier 1 operations, you can develop strategic life of mine plans to optimize the value and allow the ebb and flow of gold production that flows from that as you were through the mining cycle to be appropriately managed. That'd be my first observation. A second observation that [indiscernible] suffered from being a cash-generating asset in a small portfolio. Therefore, there haven't been the appropriate time and attention on equipment reliability, base fixed and mobile. We're getting after that this year. There's also complexity in that mine plan that we believe can be simplified as we think about how we present the different types of ore and [indiscernible] the materials handling that all through a complex processing plan [indiscernible]. And we see real opportunities there as well. And one data point, Daniel, that I'd put out there for you One [indiscernible] doesn't make a spring. But as we are in the 3 months that we've had Lihir in the Newmont portfolio, and we've worked with the team there, the dedication of our [indiscernible] or on the ground Managing Director to build a 2024 mine plan and budget that they can get after. The Lihir in the month of January, better plan for the first time in 4 years. And the cultural change and the moral that comes to be able to set a time to get after that feeds on itself, and we see a real opportunity to set the Lihir, so stretching the [indiscernible] targets for them to hit the marks and they get the confidence that they can do things because they set in Newmont portfolio and they were able to give it the support and attention that it deserves. And so hopefully that gives you some color for how we're thinking about the year.
Daniel Major: That's great. And then the second question is slightly similar, again, for asset that some had lots of potential, but not move forward, particularly as Wafi-Golpu. How much money are you spending on at the moment? And where from a timing perspective, do you see it kind of fitting into the growth pipeline, particularly kind of referencing Slide 21 of your presentation where you've got your various longer-term growth options?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. Wafi-Golpu is one of the great untapped copper resources in the world in a very prolific rig [indiscernible], it's a wonderful part of the world -- to be looking for and mining copper and gold. It's still the study phase. So there's not a significant amount of money being spent on that project. A lot of the focus is working with Harmony, our joint venture partners and the PNG government to work through the necessary negotiations to ensure that you ultimately have an investment regime that you can consider the level of investment over the time frame you [indiscernible] mine to be a secure financial framework. And so that's the main focus with what we're going through at the moment. It sits there alongside [indiscernible] the Red Chris and the ability to build up pressure oxidation circuit at Yanacocha process the sulfide ores has 3 great copper gold projects. It's a great problem to have. It's an embracement of riches in terms of the projects that line up to complete the capital behind the 4 projects we have in execution. So Wafi-Golpu is going to be a really, really important mine to contribute to the world's need for copper over the next several decades. So -- but you need to have the appropriate investment environment, you then will need to go back in and do the appropriate level of drilling and study work to understand ultimately what the cost of returns will be. Wafi-Golpu and Red Chris are both block cave mines. We've got that technology in our portfolio. We've got that capability in our portfolio. The block cave mines to invest all of the capital on front before you get a return. So its pretty important that you understand the ore body and you understand the development costs before you [indiscernible]. So that's going to be an important part of Red Chris and Wafi-Golpu for new mine as we make a decision about which projects follow Tanami 2, Ahafo North the 2 block caves at Cadia.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Greg Barnes of TD Securities.
Greg Barnes: Yes. Thank you. Just on the dividend, returning to that again, I understand, obviously, your base dividend and the share buyback program. But as you bring costs down and production up, do you see yourself transitioning to a dividend policy, there's more progressive, i.e. you raised the dividend year after year, which some of your peers who have been more success on this front, that's the approach they've taken. Is that where you see this going?
Thomas Palmer: Greg, I think about how to model [indiscernible] returns. I'd put a fixed $1 a share dividend in the model and just run it forward. Any additional cash that we generate over and once we set the parameters on cash debt, were likely that variable component is likely to come through share buybacks. Just then through a major transaction, we have increased our share count and we would look to bring that share count back down again. So for the foreseeable future, bank on $1 share dividend and any variable components of share buyback.
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Carey MacRury of Canaccord.
Carey MacRury: Just a question on the balance sheet, the $5 billion of net debt target. Are there debt metrics you're specifically targeting behind that?
Karyn Ovelmen: Yes. Essentially, our goal is always to have a financial flexibility on balance sheet and to maintain our investment-grade rating that we currently have today. So that is absolute [indiscernible] yes, in terms of the main metric, looking at a 1x net debt EBITDA ratio as we go forward.
Carey MacRury: That's helpful. And then maybe one other question, if I can. During the transaction, as you guys talked about the potential in the Golden Triangle area, no plan set out here, but can you talk a little bit about how you see that? How that region evolves over the next few years?
Thomas Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Carey. Just a little bit so I'm pretty sure I heard to say how do we set the gold trial opening up over the next few years. That's just -- I actually have a couple of trips up there sadly over the last couple of months. Real potential at Brucejack to get a really solid understanding of that ore body in life and they have a contributing nice cash for quite some time to come from a nice ore body and exploration potential around that Valley of the Kings area. So a really nice, really nice gold opportunity there. As you then swing across Red Chris really important -- that spending some time in the call shot at Red Chris and again to appreciate the size and quality of that ore body. It is going to be an amazing block cave mine. So it's really going to be about ensuring that we work to understand how to build that mine to a high-quality, understand the cost, I understand the schedule, understand the various approvals to come with that and develop that line because that line will run for decades. The original can then the other opportunities around them. So that is going to be a real focus in terms of copper in that investment. And then we bridge off that up to the Galore Creek and the work we'll do with tech to go off. We increased [indiscernible] Creek and then ultimately develop Galore Creek as another great copper mines. So that it will be [indiscernible] potential the condition for both [indiscernible] underground that we really opened up the decades of Red Chris and then pivot off that into Galore Creek.  Natascha, did you want to...
Natascha Viljoen: No, I think that [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question today is from the line of Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Just wanted to come back to just a lot of information has come out today, and I'm sort of looking out to what else is coming out above and beyond what you put out? It looks like at your Investor Day, you mentioned new life of mine plans. We've got some Cadia news, Block Cadia news coming out in the second half of the year. Am I to assume that all of the reserves, Tom, are now done to your standard on the Newcrest assets, the life of mine plans are just going to be based on these new reserves? And will we get more information than just the chart that you've put out on the 2 charts on the 5-year production and cost for your Tier 1 assets? What are we getting beyond the [indiscernible] at this Investor Day?
Thomas Palmer: The reserves and resources are set to Newmont standard. I'm looking across the road [indiscernible] he's breathing aside relief because he saw a significant lift from November 6 to a few weeks ago to get that through our processes. So that's [indiscernible] new outstanding. And you're right, what we're doing now is doing the -- so [indiscernible], is great Head of our Mineral Resource Management Group is now running strategic mine plans and life of mine plans on top of those reserve resource statements to build out potential of that got forward portfolio on top of that 5-year outlook. We'll work that over the course -- over the months ahead. We've got an important strategy day with our Board in June. Our Annual Strategy Day is always in June and we'll spend some time with our Board looking at that longer-term potential, debating that and understanding that to then build towards an Investor Day in the second half. We will start to show you and share with you a picture beyond the 5 years what we see is the potential for this Newmont upgraded portfolio over the next 5, 10, 15, 20-plus years.  We're still debating the time frame for that, but the current thinking is we refer to our normal time frame, which is typically leading around that November time frame that we have our Capital Markets Day and also talking about doing one in New York and one in Australia, so we pick up both sides of our markets. But that's the work in front of us this year is to really get after the strategic lifeline plan. So we give you that -- with confidence to give you that longer-term story for this portfolio.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So what I'm understanding from you is that we are going to get above and beyond just the 5 years that you've provided for us here, so we would have a visibility for maybe 10 years plus in your Investor Day?
Thomas Palmer: That's correct, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then my second question, I just wanted to understand, I think, Tom, you mentioned that your certain that our 6 operating assets are going to be sold the noncore one in 2024. Does that mean that we are going to be seeing your financials going forward of having discontinued assets from Q1 onwards on all of these 6 assets?
Unidentified Company Representative: Tanya, the expectation is at the end of the first quarter, 2024, that these 6 assets will be held as assets held for sale.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. All right. So then you're reporting on your operating assets and the other ones will change a little bit as we look at what you're reporting on production costs, et cetera?
Unidentified Company Representative: Correct.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for some closing remarks.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, operator, and thank you all for your time, and I look forward to catching up with you soon. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Thomas Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Rob Atkinson and Karyn Ovelmen, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce Natascha Viljoen, who officially joined the Newmont executive leadership team at the start of this month. Natascha is a seasoned industry leader and brings more than 30 years of technical, operational and executive leadership experience across a diverse range of commodities, and we are very excited to have her join our team at Newmont.  Before we begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic plan, underpinned by a very clear and focused strategy. We are leveraging our leadership and collective experience, along with the strength of our global portfolio and operating model to build a resilient and sustainable future for Newmont.  Our pending acquisition of Newcrest is a significant event for our industry. It combines two of the sector's top senior gold producers to set the new standard for sustainable, responsible gold and copper mining. I think this Is a very exciting and transformational time for Newmont and all of our stakeholders. But before we provide an update on the Newcrest transaction and what's to come, I'd like to start with a review of our safety performance.  As a company, we have been on a very intentional and significant safety journey, and we are proud that Newmont has not had a fatality in 5 years. During this time, we redesigned our fatality risk management system to ensure our standards and critical control verifications were focused on risks and behaviors that could result in a fatality. We have completed more than 1.6 million interactions by our leaders in the field that were focused on the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities.  We modified the safety targets in our annual incentive program to deliberately move away from the traditional lagging personal injury rates to the leading metrics, focused on fatality risk reduction and fatigue management. And we focused on doing a few things really, really well, including pre-start meetings, pre-task hazard assessments and infield verifications. As a consequence of these actions, we have experienced a significant improvement in our safety performance, which is evidenced by the metrics you see here on this slide. Whether health and safety is an area where you must always maintain a sense of chronic we still experience at least 1 significant potential event every 8 days. Each and every one of these are an opportunity to learn from and improve because the safety of our workforce must be considered in everything that we do, every hour, every shift and every day.  Turning to our quarterly highlights. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 10,000 tonnes of copper, generating $933 million in adjusted EBITDA and over $1 billion of cash from continuing operations, a 53% increase over the prior quarter, and we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share from our established framework. Over the last few months, we achieved a number of important milestones at our key development projects, including fully mining the upper section of the new production shaft at Tanami in Australia, receiving full funds approval for the Pamour project Porcupine in Canada and reaching commercial production at the San Marcos deposit at Cerro Negro in Argentina.  Importantly, earlier this month, we also reached a resolution with the union at our Peñasquito mine in Mexico. And we are now focused on safely returning our teams to work and ramping up operations at its Tier 1 polymetallic mine. Throughout the negotiations to resolve this issue, we maintained a strong position and held steadfast to our values, honoring the collective bargaining agreement that we had in place and ensuring that we protected the long-term value for this mining operation, our workforce, local communities and all of our stakeholders.  This unnecessary strike has caused significant hardship for many, many people. And our focus this quarter, we are on the safe ramp-up of our operations, along with the seamless integration of the Newcrest assets into Newmont's global industry-leading portfolio.  Now that we have a resolution to the strike at Peñasquito, we are updating our outlook for the remainder of the year to incorporate the following 3 impacts. The first is to reflect the suspension of operations at Peñasquito for early June to mid-October. The second is to reflect the lower than anticipated production from both Nevada Gold Mines Pueblo Viejo. And the third is to reflect lower throughput at the Ahafo mill, and Rob will provide some more details on these matters in a moment.  So for 2023, we now expect to produce 5.3 million ounces of gold from the current Newmont portfolio, with a resulting all-in sustaining cost of $1,400 an ounce. As a reminder, our full year results for 2023 that will report in late February next year will incorporate around 7 weeks of production from the 5 acquired Newcrest assets with the transaction currently on track to close on Monday, the 6th of November.  I'll now turn it to Rob and then Karyn to take us through the quarterly results and the important work ahead to deliver a strong fourth quarter, then I'll provide an update on the Newcrest transaction and what will be the focus of our integration efforts from day 1. Over to you, Rob.
Robert Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my discussion around the high-margin Tier 1 assets in our portfolio today, starting with Boddington. During the third quarter, I had the opportunity to visit Boddington and spend time with the team as they continue to ramp up the planned waste movement in the North and the South pits and prepare for the planned mill maintenance shutdown in the fourth quarter. Laybacks are progressing well, and Boddington delivered solid production in the third quarter as expected.  The strong quarterly performance has helped to offset the impact from mill maintenance and unusually wet weather. Despite the heavy rainfall in the third quarter, effective utilization for the autonomous whole fleet has improved significantly compared to this time last year. Funds mined are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. And I'm pleased to say that we have successfully completed the commissioning of a further 5 new Cat autonomous haul trucks to accelerate stripping in 2024 and position this cornerstone gold copper mine to reach higher grades in 2025.  Turning to Tanami. Our Tier 1 mine in the Northern Territory continues to deliver consistently strong results. following the record wet weather and extended flooding experienced in the region during the first quarter of the year. We achieved record mill throughput in August, beating the previous record we set in March of this year. And we continue to expect to reach the year's highest rates and production levels in the fourth quarter.  However, we are closely monitoring the impact and the status of the very large wildfires currently burning in the immediate vicinity of Tanami and in the Northern Territory, and we will continue, as always, to prioritize the health and the safety of our workforce. We also continue to progress our second expansion project at Tanami, and I was encouraged to see the headway the team is making during my recent visit.  We've achieved a significant milestone in the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft, fully aligning the upper sections and removing the mid-shaft And as is typical with projects of this size, we will review the project plan as we commence the lining of the lower sections, taking into account the work that has been done so far, the current ground conditions and the overbreak needing to be mitigated in the lower section of the shaft.  Once complete, this project will deliver significant ounce and cost improvements, further strengthening the already strong margins at our Tier 1 operation at Tanami, and we look forward to providing an update with our guidance in February of next year.  Turning to Ahafo. As Tom mentioned, third quarter mill throughput was impacted by routine condition monitoring by our asset management team, identified hairline fractures to one of the large grinding mills at Ahafo. To reduce any further deterioration to the and to prevent a catastrophic failure, we made the decision to operate at less than full capacity, bringing throughput to around 60% for the third quarter. We have in October swapped the gut tiers between our 2 milling circuits at Ahafo to ensure our most productive milling circuit is able to run at 100%.  This will allow Ahafo to run at approximately 80% of until we again reached full processing rates in the second quarter of 2024 when we will install a brand-new Also, during the quarter, Ahafo accessed higher-grade ore from Subika Underground and successfully commissioned the replacement conveyor ahead of schedule and below budget. The Ahafo North project continues to progress as planned, and we have access to all critical parcels of land to commence construction of the processing plant and mine services facilities.  Airports are ongoing, heavy mining equipment is being assembled and commissioned, contractors are fully mobilized, and we remain on track to commence pre-stripping of the first mining area called the pit in the fourth quarter of this year.  Turning to Peñasquito. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, we reached a definitive agreement with the union and received approval from the Mexican Labor Court on October 13. We have safely restarted operations, and the ramp-up is progressing well so far. We are anticipating a return to full productivity in the next 2 to 3 weeks, and we have restarted waste stripping in the Peñasquito pit and are now feeding the crusher with ore from the Chile Colorado pit. We are importantly also continuing to strongly focus on the engagement with our workforce.  This unnecessary strike caused significant hardship for all of our employees, contractors communities, suppliers and customers. Peñasquito is the largest employer in Zacatecas with a direct workforce of more than 5,000 and another 28,000 people in neighboring communities who are part of the mines local and national supply chain, service providers and contractors. As we look ahead to the exciting and profitable future for Peñasquito, we will continue to honor our commitments, work closely with all of our stakeholders with the law and the collective bargaining agreement and work to protect the long-term value of this Tier 1 polymetallic mine.  Moving to our non-managed joint ventures. Through our joint venture partnerships, Newmont has an interest in 4 Tier 1 assets Cortez and Turquoise Ridge. The joint ventures are core to Newmont's portfolio and contributed 352,000 ounces or 27% of attributable gold production in the third quarter. As Tom mentioned, reported performance from our non-managed operations has been below expectations for the year, impacting our ability to achieve our production and cost targets for 2023.  We have adjusted our projections for both Pueblo Video and Nevada Gold Mines and look forward to an improved performance in the fourth quarter from our joint venture partners. On top of the 800,000 ounces of gold produced from our Tier 1 operations and joint ventures, the remainder of Newmont portfolio contributed approximately 500,000 ounces of profitable gold production, an increase of more than 100,000 ounces compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate solid results from these efforts through the rest of the year.  Before I hand it to Karyn, I'd like to take a moment to cover a few highlights from our development projects we are currently executing. On top of the achievements that I already noted at our second expansion at Tanami and Ahafo North, we also achieved key milestones at Cerro Negro, Porcupine and At Cerro Negro, we declared commercial production for San Marcos across the 6 ore bodies associated with this exciting district expansion. This opens up a further 650,000 ounces of high-grade gold, which will be mined over the coming 10 years.  This milestone was delivered on time and on budget, and we expect to start realizing the benefit from these high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter of this year. At Porcupine, the Pamour project has been approved for full funds by the Board. This opens up a further 2.1 million ounces of gold and will be mined over the coming 11 years, which helps extend the Porcupine complex operational life to at least 2035. Our mining team will commence pre-stripping in the fourth quarter and are tracking well to produce in 2024.  And finally, we advanced our underground project to Akyem to the feasibility stage, where drilling from the surface has already delivered results that are beyond our initial expectations. And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Rob. Let's get started with the financial highlights. During the third quarter, revenue was $2.5 billion at a realized gold price of $1,920 per ounce, and adjusted EBITDA was $933 million, was up 10% from the third quarter of last year, driven by higher gold prices and lower direct operating costs.  We also generated $1 billion of cash from operations and $397 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to move through a period of significant reinvestment back into our business. And we closed the quarter with a steady cash position of $3.2 billion in a leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.  From a financial standpoint, our goal is to maintain a best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet while funding value-accretive projects and delivering healthy returns. And in recognition of Newmont's ongoing balance sheet strength and financial flexibility, I'm pleased to say that we have received a first time A- rating from Fitch with a stable outlook. We also maintained solid margins in the third quarter, despite the challenges that Rob mentioned at Peñasquito, Ahafo and our non-management joint ventures.  Third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $157 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Adjustments this quarter included $0.14 related to revisions in reclamation and remediation plans at former operations, $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.02 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest and $0.05 related to tax adjustments and other items.  Taking these into account, we reported third quarter adjusted net income of $0.36 per diluted share. As a reference to those modeling included in our quarterly results are $131 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito. This quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis. This dividend was declared within our established framework calibrated at a gold price of $1,700 million per ounce and in line with our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share.  Newmont had paid over $5 billion in dividends since closing the Goldcorp transaction in 2019, demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders. On the close of the Newcrest acquisition, Newmont will integrate 5 new operations into our robust global operating model. February of next year, we expect to provide our 2024 outlook for the combined company with our fourth quarter and full year results.  Consistent with our process, our outlook will inform our 2024 dividend payout range, which we will calibrate within our established dividend framework. As a reminder, we assess the variable portion of our dividends annually in alignment with the business planning cycle, projected cash flows and the current macroeconomic environment. Similar to this year, our 2024 dividend payout range will apply to our fourth quarter dividend to be declared in February and will be reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors each quarter.  For a longer-term view of our portfolio, we will apply a disciplined and thoughtful approach to setting market guidance for the combined company. We expect to provide our long-term outlook after we've had some time on the ground with the Newcrest assets and following our annual strategy session with our Board of Directors, which typically takes place in June.  We look forward to and providing more information on the exciting opportunities ahead for both current and future stakeholders. And with that, I'll pass it on to Tom for an update on the Newcrest transaction.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. The combination of Newmont and Newcrest represents an exceptional value proposition for shareholders and all our other stakeholders. Through an unrivaled platform, featuring the industry's best talent, growing the highest concentration of Tier 1 assets in the most favorable jurisdictions, Newmont is uniquely positioned to generate superior returns for decades to come. Recognizing the strategic rationale to create the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets, 96% of votes cast by Newmont shareholders and 93% of votes cast by Newcrest shareholders were overwhelmingly in favor of this transformational transaction.  All of the regulatory approvals and shareholder votes now secured, we expect to close the transaction on Monday, the 6th of November, and set the new standard for gold and copper mining across the industry. Following the close of the transaction, the core of our portfolio will be 10 Tier 1 assets, representing more than half of the world's top-tier gold mines. And these assets will have the scale, mine life, cost profile and resilience to position Newmont to deliver strong and stable returns for several decades.  Leveraging the learnings from operating our current Tier 1 assets, along with our comprehensive asset strategy work, we will be applying the strength of our operating model, our people and our systems with the newly acquired Tier 1 assets in Lihir and Cadia as well as Brucejack and Red Chris in our emerging Tier 1 district of British Columbia. There is no doubt that Newmont will be operating the world's best gold copper portfolio under one umbrella, benefiting from our existing portfolio, operating model, sustainability practices and disciplined capital allocation process.  Every one of our assets is managed through our integrated global operating model, supported by a big bench of experienced leaders and subject matter experts with a track record of safely delivering value. And within this global operating model, we will have 6 regional business units, each led by a dedicated managing director. From the start of November, Natascha will assume accountability for our Australian business unit, led by Mia Gous, our North American business unit led by Bernard Wessels and Papua New Guinea, where we have Alwyn Pretorius returning to Newmont to head up this newly established business unit.  Through early 2024, Rob will continue to have accountability for our African business unit led by Dave Thornton, our Latin American and Caribbean business unit led by Mark Rogers, and our Peruvian business unit led by Rahman Amoadu. We are very fortunate to have Rob as a continuing member of our executive leadership team, particularly during this important integration period. Natascha and Rob will work together closely in the coming months, and both leaders will be pivotal in delivering synergies for the Newcrest acquisition and driving operational results that demonstrate our position as the benchmark gold equity.  In just a few days, we'll be welcoming our Newcrest colleagues to Newmont. And on day 1, my extended leadership team and I will be on site across every Newcrest location. As we begin our integration work with the Newcrest team, we'll be focused on 3 key systems that have been fundamental to our success at Newmont. The first is our fatality risk management program, which is at the very core of our safety approach. And put simply, great companies do not kill people.  Second is our Respect@Work program, a key benefit from bringing these 2 companies together is the alignment in our values and culture, in particular, around safe and inclusive workplaces. We have the opportunity to learn from each other with the programs we both have in place. Like many other companies in the mining industry, we know there are systemic issues that allow sexism, racism, discrimination, harassment and bullying to continue to be experienced in our workplaces.  These disrespectful behaviors have no place at Newmont. And we'll be working together to take actions to create a workplace with everyone is welcome and safe. The third key system is our full potential program, which will commence rolling out at both Lihir and Cadia in November to support the delivery of our synergy commitments. Full Potential is a program that I have led at the Newmont over the last decade. It is the most sustainable improvement program that I've worked with in my 35-year career in the industry, and it was key to delivering over $1 billion in synergies from our acquisition of Goldcorp some 4 years ago.  However, Full Potential delivers much more than just cost savings and productivity improvements. It sustains and improves our culture by breaking down barriers and encouraging active participation, global collaboration and sharing lessons learned across our organization.  During our due diligence work back in May, we identified and committed to $500 million in annual synergies across 3 categories: G&A, supply chain and Full Potential. As we look ahead to the closing of the transaction and the delivery of these synergies over the first 24 months, we are very excited about the long-term value and opportunities it will bring to both sets of stakeholders and our combined workforce. This transaction creates the best possible collection of Tier 1 gold and copper assets in the industry, all supported by the industry's best talent, technical capabilities, sustainability practices and disciplined capital allocation process.  We'll also increase our investor outreach, welcoming shareholders from Australia that will form an important part of our shareholder base as we look to establish and then grow our listing on the ASX. We have a long history and a shared heritage in Australia, and we will be strengthening our presence in this key mining jurisdiction. We're upon the close of this transaction, around 30% of our revenues will be derived.  We're looking forward to welcoming the experienced and talented team at Newcrest and providing our first integration update on the combined business for the first quarter of next year. And with that, I thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America.
Lawson Winder: You've all discussed the likelihood for the combined company to have lower production than a combined 8 million ounces annually. What is the urgency with which you intend to sell any noncore assets to reduce from that level and improve the overall combined portfolio?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Lawson, for the question. In terms of it, as Karyn talked about in terms of us taking time to work through the longer-term outlook with more like a midyear then we will run a Capital Markets Day to share that, what we'll look to do almost immediately after close is we have a reserve and resource, review team. We call it our 3R review. We have that team going in each of the 5 operations at Newcrest and establish the reserve and resources to the Newmont definition. And then with that reserve and resource review done, we're going to establish Newmont-based resource models. and then start to develop our mine plans based upon previous best demonstrated performance and then have those start to convert into business plans, and then we'll iterate and work those.  So we'll certainly work to reduce a 2024 budget for the combined portfolio, but we're going to take our time to really understand and work those mine plans to understand the potential of those operations, ensure we can deliver on those operations, but also understand projects across that portfolio and how they together. So that's going to be work will do diligently over the -- starting in early November for the first few months of next year.  In terms of the full portfolio of 17 managed operations, as I've described in my remarks, Lawson, we can very comfortably manage those operations within our global operating model. Listen, this is an intensive purposes is a bolt-on of 5 operations in the Newmont's operating model. 2 operations in the Australian business unit. When I was running the Australian business units some years ago, I had that number and a couple more from memory, 2 operations into North American business unit. Bernard Wessels is very capable to accommodate those 2 operations and manage them and then standing up our new business unit in Papa New Guinea.  And as I mentioned, one of the very best leaders I've been work at Newmont, Alwyn Pretorius, who retired to go work on his family farm in South Africa, is coming back to Newmont and stand up that business unit. So someone who's very experienced having run very successfully our business unit in Africa some years ago and then our Latin American business unit.  He understands developing world, he understands Newmont and he is really well placed to stand up that new PNG business. So we will capably run those 17 operations and his team will look at where the opportunities might be to optimize our portfolio. We have a commitment of $2 billion over the first 24 months. That will be a combination of project resequencing, come part of that business planning work that we'll do, but we'll also be looking to where the opportunity is to rationalize our portfolio.  And we'll be looking at those operations that are Tier 2, and we have a number of Tier 2 operations in our portfolio. Several has a potential to grow to Tier 1, but we have a number that include in Tier 2 and work through a very structured process to think about how we might rationalize the portfolio. But we are very comfortable also to be able to run 17 operations in our business.
Lawson Winder: And if I could follow up just one final question on your Full Potential comments in your prepared remarks and synergies. Can you comment on which assets might get the greatest attention for that program post closing on the NCM side? And put another way, is there a Peñasquito in the NCM portfolio that could materially exceed expectations included in the initial synergy guidance?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Lawson $500 million, $200 million is attributable to our Full Potential work. There are 2 Peñasquitos in the Newcrest portfolio, Lihir and Cadia. That's where we're focusing our time and attention of the $200 million we see the order of $90 million coming out of Lihir as we think about the opportunities to improve the work we do around the mine, the basics of mining from and blast and maintenance asset management work. So we're presenting the best ore consistently the in that processing plant. We'll have people on the ground next month to start really getting in and understanding those opportunities that we saw during due diligence.  I think we certainly plan to tell a story out of Lihir very similar to the story we've told out at Peñasquito. And then Cadia, the other very large Tier 1 operation in the Newcrest portfolio. We see opportunities in the processing plant. Big block cave mine, roughly 35 million tonnes a year coming out of that underground mine. The opportunities we see are to work the bottlenecks in the processing plant, the availability, the reliability, getting consistent throughput through the crushing and grinding circuit so that we've got consistent to the service and then improve both throughput and recovery.  Again, very similar to where we've worked Peñasquito with a big mill, crushing and grinding circuit with multiple plantation service. So Peñasquito story and the Boddington story in terms of work in the mill is where we see the analogy or the analog to Cadia and then working on mine at Cadia is very similar to the work that Rob and the team led at Peñasquito to deliver significant improvement out of that mine to present a very hungry mill at Peñasquito.
Lawson Winder: Fantastic. I look forward to further updates and congratulations.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Morgan with Barrenjoey.
Daniel Morgan: My first question is about the issues that you had this year, how much all of the issues you've had that has led to the production downgrade today? How much does that follow into 2024? Obviously, Peñasquito doesn't. But can you just run through some of the assets and whether some of the issues run into 2024?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Daniel, and good morning to you. I think it and thank you for staying up in Australia to listen in, and thank you for your coverage. But if you look at the big assets in the Newmont portfolio today, Peñasquito is now that we're up and running, we're very confident that there's been a reset of expectations with our workforce and the union that them. So we go into '24 very confident about the ability to the cost and productivity improvement safely at that operation.  The impact on '24 is the mine sequence. So where we were in the mine sequence when the operations were suspended means that what we thought would happen in '24 will be different now. So polymetallic mine, so we're in the Chile Colorado pit, which is more on the other metals and gold. So we won't swing back into Peñasquito now to therefore, it will be the balance of metals that come out of Peñasquito that will be different in '24, and the gold equivalent ounces large  At Ahafo, we will be nursing the girth gear that's now on the mill. So there's 2 big SAG mills at Ahafo. The girth gear on the main feed to the process plant is 2/3 and the throughput for the mill is now and that can run at 100%. We'll now nurse the girth gear with the hairline cracks on the small amount, about 1/3 of the throughput until the end of the first quarter, start of the second quarter of next year. So the processing plant at Ahafo will run at around 70%, 80% of throughput as we get through that very managed transition.  There are probably the 2 impacts on our big Tier 1 operations we think in the '24. We still to see plants out of our non-managed joint ventures, they like about 30% of Newmont's portfolio today. At Pueblo Viejo, we're commissioning a very significant expansion to a pressure oxidation circuit. So as that is understood and plants are built in '24, that will reflect the latest information from that commissioning exercise. And then 3 big mines in Nevada and as you work through '23 and then understand impacts on '23 performance and what that means for mines other things in '24 potentially some impacts there that we'll learn about in the next couple of months as we work with our joint venture partners on those plants.  So hopefully, Daniel, that gives you some color as to how we think about the impacts from '23 into '24. I think the important thing is that were all of the events we've had this year, all of that metal is still in the ground. And this is just a process of the time at which that metal present. None of those issues have any impact in terms of the reserves that we have, and it's just the timing at which they can be converted into metal and sold.
Daniel Morgan: That's probably a good segue, Tom, into my next question, which is the market can sometimes get fixated on short-term issues and forget that the gold is still there. So if the market does do that in the share price underperforms as it has year-to-date, is it an opportune time at some point soon to look to a buyback to maybe communicate to the market that there is long-term value in the share price and the market may not be pricing in?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Daniel. That's certainly say for anyone looking at Newmont's stock today, there's some tremendous buying out there in terms of the transaction we're about to close and the portfolio that we'll be in less than 2 weeks' time. Daniel, the process we'll work through. We'll diligently work through our business planning for what I was mentioning in the answer to the previous question, we've got 5 new assets to develop Newmont base mine plans to and work through a process of determining our 2024 budget and continuing in parallel work on the longer-term plans.  That will then inform our capital allocation process, which for us is ensuring we're maintaining a strong balance sheet, ensuring that we're directing appropriate levels of cash towards reinvestment back in the business to extend life and the growth and ensure we've got returns available to our shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy as returns first and foremost been through our dividend framework. So we'll work through our business planning process, particularly for 2024 year and look to how we calibrate our dividend framework when you think about assumptions about gold price, the cash flow we generated and some of the other macroeconomic events that will be impacting our business in our world at that time.  That will be the primary debate and discussion we'll have. But as we have that debate and we present those numbers to our Board and we look at the cash we're generating, we look at our share price, it is an area that we will continue to debate as a second order capital allocation element returns to shareholders and whether there would be some benefit in terms of how we're seeing the business and whether there will be any benefit in seeking permission from the Board to establish a buyback program. So it'll be part of the debate. But our first order returns to our shareholders is through the dividend framework.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank.
Tanya Jakusconek: Just have a couple that I just need some clarity on. Tom, can we just go back to the Newcrest merger that is pending. Can we just talk about Newcrest's reserves and resources? When you report your guidance in February of 2024 for the year and your reserves and resources, will you be adjusting those reserves and resources based on your inputs just like you did with Goldcorp when you took over, you've made adjustments from the reserve to the resource category? And if so, can you review with us some of the mines that we may see some shift. That's my first question.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. Yes, you can expect something very similar to what took place when we acquired Goldcorp. So we'll have a team -- a technical team on the ground across those 5 operations through November and December assessing the reserves and resource at each of those operations and assessing those against our Newmont definition. So we obviously report under SEC rules and Newcrest report under So there will be some differences in terms of what is classified as a reserve and resource and then we also have a very high standard at Newmont, right? A Newmont reserve is a higher standard in the industry. So you will see some back and forth.  The various announcements we've made since we announced the binding agreement, you'll see us talk about a couple of instances about reserves and resources, and you'll see us report them separately for the 2 companies because there are 2 different definitions for those. So we are working towards with our February time frame to update reserves and resources for the combined portfolio.  And in terms of any sort of signaling, we haven't -- and I think it's important that everybody is we had access to a data room for 4 weeks back in April and May to assess and to submit a binding offer and to determine our synergy values and to make some judgments about portfolio optimization. Since that time, both companies are required to run as independent companies. And so we have had an integration team working on planning for integration, but we have not had any access to any additional Newcrest information since that time.  We get the keys to the car on Monday, the 6th of November. That's the first time we get access to reserves and resources, mine plans and the can start that work. So it's in front of us, Tanya, in a couple of weeks' time.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So there isn't anything that you can think of, for example, the Lihir where some of those reserves, I think, is about 3 million ounces or thereabouts in the reserve category that need the additional layback from the, I think, the dam wall to be included, whether something like that could shift from reserves to resources given Newmont's stricter definition. Have you -- I'm just giving that as an example. I'm just wondering if there's anything between the 2 accountings, the 2 IFRS and U.S. GAAP on the reserves just is glaring to you at this point.
Thomas Palmer: Nothing is that level of granularity, Tanya, but our expectation is similar to the Goldcorp experience. You will see -- without going into specifics, you will Newcrest reported reserves in some instances move into Newmont reported resources. You've also seen -- I think many people fully understand as we move from interest reporting to accounting to U.S. GAAP accounting, our definitions for the stockpiles and for sustaining capital and other things can change. Our coproduct, byproduct accounting will which change. There'll be some moving parts around all of that as well. But we don't have that granularity yet, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So -- and then just on the long-term guidance, I think I heard that, that will be provided after the Board strategy meetings in June. So should we be thinking midyear for a 5-year guidance outlook?
Thomas Palmer: That's what we're planning to do, Tanya. And what do we want to get through that good working session with our Board and then really look to set up the Capital Markets Day where we can come together and work through that longer-term view, certainly the 5-year, and certainly with the portfolio on where will be looking to show the 5- to 10-year view of the strength of this portfolio. But we certainly want to work with those mine plans over the first few months of next year in order to really have a wrap-up story to share with the market.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then just maybe on any more severance and/or restructuring costs that we are going to be incurring in Q4? Or have these all been taken in Q3?
Thomas Palmer: The severance costs in Q3 largely unrelated to this transaction that was associated with the reset work happening down at Yanacocha as we're ramping down there, and we've got folks taking some voluntary redundancies. So we will start to see the transaction-related severances flow in the fourth quarter, and then they'll flow into the third quarter of next year where you'll see that probably the larger numbers will be in the first quarter of next year than the fourth quarter of this year.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So more cost in Q4 and Q1 to come. And then my last question is I just kind of would like...
Thomas Palmer: [indiscernible]
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes. Okay. With the transaction, yes. And then just my last question is just your view on sort of all of these index rebalancing from now until year-end. Could you give us some overall qualitative information in terms of what quantitative do you have in terms of how you see all of these index rebalancing occurring or what your view is on year-end? Too hard with all this movement in the share prices as we look at the stock, yes.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. Lots of moving parts happening at the moment, certainly with the in that process at the index rebalancing as Newcrest coming off the ASX and our secondary listing coming on the ASX and all of that work happening as well as the volatility in terms of gold price movements. And so there's lots of moving parts affecting stock performance at the moment. When we look at the -- we look at our modeling getting thrown out the other side of the rebalancing between the -- our head stock in the New York Stock Exchange and the secondary listing in the ASX, it's likely to be a month or 2 for that to settle out.  So we anticipate -- and certainly as we've had conversations with shareholders in Australia and describing what we're going to anticipate happening quite a bit of volatility in liquidity before things start to settle out in terms of New York Stock Exchange and ASX. We think there'll be some movement of potentially up to AUD 10 billion that could flow the other. We also anticipate that we'll have something in the order of AUD 10 billion to AUD 15 billion market cap sitting on the ASX, representing 20% to 30% of our market cap. That where the starting point will lean into and then look that secondary listing, alongside our primary listing. So we get some modeling that sort of shows some scenarios as to where we may land between New York Stock Exchange and ASX. and that -- and we fully anticipate that it will be volatile and liquid for a month or a couple of months before it settles down and get a line of sight on the Board.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So what I take on that is some outflows from now until year-end with all of this rebalancing and then settling in and then obviously on a positive side with the Australian listing.
Thomas Palmer: The positive side of the Australian listing with a very savvy mining investment community and some very sticky funds with the big super funds there and lots of interest as we then go to that investment community. And then you'll also see -- I think you'll see positive trends is from a passive standpoint with our larger market cap as things settle out, I think you're going to see some of that flow as well. So noisy, but there's some very good signs as to what this portfolio is going to be able to attract.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson with RBC.
Joshua Wolfson: I understand there's a lot of moving parts here. But is it possible to provide some goalposts or some indication of what the cost structure looks like even just for the Newmont portfolio going forward? When we take a look at the numbers, fourth quarter, based on guidance, looks to be an annualized rate of 6 million ounces, which is, let's call it, average for the company, and the implied AISC is closer to about $1,350, which would be quite a bit higher than where the company was discussing costs at least for 2024 under the old structure. So I understand a lot of moving parts, but just anything on inflation or costs for some the Newmont portfolio going forward.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Josh. I mean it's a tricky one this year because of some of the events we've managed, which are really impacting ounce production. There has been slowing impact on cost. But when we look through that to our direct cost base, it's very much in line with what we're expecting for this year. And then as we look into next year, that direct cost base is looking pretty steady. So it's sort of staying at the levels that we've seen and the sort of stabilizing out of inflation very much as we look into next year is doing a planning work, at least the direct cost base looks very similar this year.  So for us, it will be working through the ounce profile for this combined portfolio. But thinking about -- we'll think about our portfolio in a couple of different chunks as we we're doing our plan. What will be the Tier 1 operations and the emerging Tier 1 operations that we manage and how we think about those. We'll be thinking about 3 non-managed joint ventures that will have in our portfolio, Nevada Gold Mines, Pueblo Viejo And then we'll be thinking about those Tier 2 assets and how we manage those Tier 2 assets and those that would be more likely to be part of that portfolio optimization.  So we think about what's our cost base for the Tier 1 operations, emerging Tier 1 portfolio that we manage. We will be challenging our non-managed joint ventures around their cost base. And then we're looking at how we manage our Tier 2 assets going forward. So we'll be having those debates in and build our business plans. But the high-level answer to your question is our direct cost base is very consistent with what we see this year, and we'll be working to ensure that we've got some of those that we're throwing out the other side of some of those challenges that we've had with bush fires and flooding, a strike and manufacturing with So we'll certainly be looking at the plan for '24 being pretty consistent in that profile for those operations a pretty consistent cost base.
Joshua Wolfson: Got it. Okay. And then another question, I'm not sure if you can provide any details or review of this. But following the Newcrest recent operating update, I'm just wondering the performance of these assets, has that affected your views on maybe some of the complexity or the strategy for integrating this portfolio or maybe how you're going to manage that process?
Thomas Palmer: No, Josh, nothing's changed from our due diligence. We are crystal clear on how we will manage those operations and how we will integrate them into our operating model, and we're well advanced in -- well advanced in planning in terms of what we'll do on day 1, week 1, month 1 and the first 100 days. So there's nothing about anything happened in the sort of the more recent times that changes our long-term view on those assets and how we integrate
Operator: Our final question today comes from Anita Soni with CIBC World Markets.
Anita Soni: So the first one I think was -- is related to capital allocation. When you deliver on the $2 billion in portfolio optimization, can you give us an idea whether or not that could be used to support a dividend, if needed? Or do you think you have uses for that capital in terms of reinvesting in your portfolio?
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Anita. So the portfolio optimization will come from 2 categories. One will be resequencing the projects of the combined portfolio. And so the -- you match the 2 portfolios together, that would have been the cash going towards development projects and reinvesting, that will change, and that will then lead to free cash flow that we're generating be informing the decisions we make around calibrating our dividend framework. So that portfolio optimization will actually lead to generating free cash flow for support of the dividend.  Then the portfolio optimization with the proceeds that we received from divestments of assets. First and foremost, we would bring that on to our balance sheet -- to strengthen our balance sheet and then make judgments about how we use the cash on our balance sheet. And certainly, as we did with the Goldcorp, we look back to our Goldcorp experience and we look at where our -- to the answer of the earlier question, we look at where our share price is trading, we have a robust view of where we value.  And if we thought that there was some opportunity to buy back some shares, so that would be a debate we would have with our Board. But the first and foremost, that cash will come on to our balance sheet and be used to strengthen and bolster the balance sheet of the combined organization.
Anita Soni: Okay. Second question, just more a little more on the nitty-gritty. Looking at Boddington, is that an appropriate run rate this quarter? Is that kind of what you'll be doing in terms of throughput in grades as you go into 2024 and continue with that layback? Or will that become more, I guess, exacerbated and more stockpile use and more waste stripping happening?
Thomas Palmer: Certainly, as we -- a bit of a high sustaining capital, Anita, was around getting our hands on 5 trucks to get after the -- and we had access to those 5 trucks are getting in early, I think, after the waste movement in the North pit to really start to open up the North and South pit to the high-grade ore. So we'll move through '24 and '25 into some more waste movement, some run of mine ore coming into the plant, but also starting to supplement that stockpile. So you will see a movement into in that normal cycle of and moving into more waste and some stockpiles and so some lower gold and copper in that normal band that Boddington operates through. So you will see a bit of that dynamic playing out in '24, '25 before get back into the high-grade ore
Anita Soni: Okay. And then the final question is with regards to the projects, particularly Tanami, where I think you pared back some -- revised your development capital number citing the rainfall events that you had. I just wanted to understand when you guys review the projects and the capital? And where you basically -- do you think you're okay on your capital at Tanami expansion to right now? Or should we be expecting to see an update there? And I ask this because we've seen unit cost escalation across the board, and we just haven't had an update on those capital numbers for about a year or so.
Thomas Palmer: Thanks, Anita. So we've reached an important milestone at Tanami, where the mid-shaft the upper part of the of the shaft and now we're at that mid-shaft level setting up the infrastructure and then get after the lining of the lower part of the shaft. So it's an important milestone for you pause and understand the working -- what you've learned from mining the top part of the shaft, how you're going to apply those learnings to the bottom half of the shaft and what the condition of the bottom half of the shaft as now going to the run That work is happening right now.  As we're seeing in the Australian market, I think the key cost pressure in capital projects is labor. And so just ensuring we understand the labor. We have a favor there and full crews as we get set to go for that second round of shaft lining. That work is live as we're working that through as part of our planning processes and doing our cost and schedule for the run that would certainly be something that we would be expecting to provide an update with our 2024 guidance in the latter part of February next year. So we're at the milestone of the project and it's nice to lined up with '24 -- February 24 update.
Anita Soni: Okay. So just on that note, can you just go versus February 2024, you will provide guidance for the combined portfolio for 2024 -- sorry, for 2024 only. And then June, you will provide the combined portfolio -- or midyear, you'll provide a 5-year for the combined portfolio. Is that correct?
Thomas Palmer: That's correct, Anita.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then lastly, on the dividends, what you had said it for next year, that would be in February as well, right?
Thomas Palmer: 2024 dividend would be -- the dividend would be calibrated for 2024, and we will be sharing that information with our guidance in February 2024.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
John Tumazos: Thanks, operator, and thank you all for taking the time to our call today, and please enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-20 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy. And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value, and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations. There were four important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Peñasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the Union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the Union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The Union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor. At Newmont, Peñasquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important time for Peñasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers, and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the Union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleón Gómez to cease this strike action and return their members to work. The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Éléonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance. Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for two weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there. And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months. As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed at Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our two non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business. We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp four years ago as we build out our integration plans. We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, making the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years. At Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business. It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability. In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last five years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular, in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination. I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with five additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset. Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami. Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months. As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges. At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year. And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well and with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year. Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Éléonore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was, and will always be, the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis. Moving to Porcupine, we delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well-positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the premarket and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024. At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase scope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift stope [ph]. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter. And finally, Cripple Creek and Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities. And now moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian Pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance. Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tonnes mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of six new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023. Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Peñasquito on June 7, as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Peñasquito. And now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our two non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half. And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.
Karyn Ovelmen: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have. Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success. Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed our initial expectations. Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle. Turning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables. We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years. In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and margins in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction cost associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest, and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items. Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito since the strike commenced and at Éléonore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires. As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well-positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last two quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. Over the last two months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions, whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood. Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government. Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister, James Marape; Deputy Prime Minister, John Russo; and Mining Minister, Sir Ano Pala. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project. We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results. With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Greg Barnes: Yeah. Thank you very much. Tom, I just wanted to ask about inflationary pressures and how you see them evolving into the second half of 2023 and 2024 ex any volume improvements you're going to get, which obviously will help on a gold per ounce basis?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Greg. Good morning. What we're seeing in our direct cost is largely consistent with what we expected as we guided this year, and I just step through that in a little bit more detail. About half our cost base is labor, about 50% is labor made up pretty evenly between employees and contractors. Employees largely stable and expect that to remain largely stable through the rest of this year and into next. Certainly, seeing some settling down in Australia, Canada, United States. Contracted services also have stabilized. So still at a higher cost that we saw with the inflation coming through last year, but largely stabilized, maybe a little bit of easing into the second half of this year, but certainly seeing the volatility come out of that, and that's at 50%, that's a pretty important driver. 30% materials and consumables. So it's the various reagents, particularly cyanide, explosive, steel for grinding media and the like. We're seeing those largely consistent with what we expected. Natural gas prices have come off, which is then flowing through to the prices that we're seeing for both cyanide and explosives. So a little bit of relief tailwinds with those consumables and would expect that to flow through the second half of this year. We'll see supply of natural gas may be tighten a bit, which may put a bit more tension on those prices, but certainly expecting to see that stable or a little bit of an improvement and still pretty much holding its own as we look at the grinding median to remove around the place. And then the next big category is fuel and energy 15% and that's driven by diesel. And we've certainly seen some relief in oil prices relative to what we've assumed. And we would expect to see that carry on through the second half of this year, but a volatile commodity and one that we'll continue to be conservative as we think about our assumptions for that. So a few tailwinds reg some stability and consistent with what we expected for 2023.
Greg Barnes: Great. That's very helpful, Tom. And just a follow-on. In the presentation, you talked about the guidance you're going to provide in February. I'm just wondering how detailed do you expect to be in February around Newcrest and your expectations for how that's going to fold into the company in 2024?
Tom Palmer: We're certainly working towards being in a position where we can give you a view of 2024 for the combined portfolio, which would include our view of the five Newcrest assets being folded into our operations. So if things continue to go to plan in terms of regulatory approvals, shareholder votes and close, integration planning busily being done. We'll receive the keys to the car so to speak in early November, I would hope, and that gives us time to work through those mine plans, apply the Newmont lens on those mine plans and the assumptions we make for some of the key input assumptions and certainly working towards being in a position to provide the 2024 guidance for the combined portfolio in the February timeframe.
Greg Barnes: And what about the three to five-year guidance beyond that, will that wait?
Tom Palmer: We will monitor that. And see how those numbers come together. We'll certainly be looking in the 2024 timeframe to provide as much information as we think appropriate, certainly for 2024 in that February timeframe and then -- and look for a logical time for a Capital Markets Day to share some more information on the combined portfolio and maybe even look to try and include some sort of site visit with that. So, that's still work in progress, Greg. But certainly, 2024 is in our side for the February timeframe.
Greg Barnes: Great. Okay. Thank you, Tom. That’s it from me.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Greg.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question goes to Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead, your line is open.
Anita Soni: Hi, good morning Tom and team. My first question with regards to the transaction, could you tell me, did the independent adviser or the independent expert for Newcrest reach that conclusion yet?
Tom Palmer: Good morning Anita and thank you for dialing in. I think that might be a little vacation period for you. So, good to hear your voice, and hopefully, you can get off this call and back to some better years of time. They're still working through that process. So, that's their working -- it's in train working through, but not finished yet. So, it's -- but it's on schedule in terms of when we need that information in order to be able to proceed for the time line we had in the deck.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then the second question, and then I'll go back into the queue. I'm just trying to get some of the grades that Rob quickly went through in terms of -- so let's start with Musselwhite. I think they said 30% improvement in tons mined and then grades by 40%. Is that a Q3 or Q4? If I do that in Q3, I get well above your guide.
Tom Palmer: We're certainly starting to see a step-up in grade in both Q3 and Q4, pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4 for Musselwhite and it -- we're opening up with a nice double lift stope coming on, which is going to give us both some improvement in grade and volume. And then we've got some grades and some high-grade material also coming on as a result of the work in the first half. So, pretty consistent grade. Rob through the second half and certainly seeing a step-up in volume coming out. That will ramp up over the third and fourth quarter. So, the highest volume through the mill in the fourth quarter rate pretty consistent.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then just in terms of -- I think at Ahafo where you were talking -- or maybe it was achieved a 35% uptick in grades in Q3. Is that correct?
Tom Palmer: That's right, Anita. So, in Akyem, we stepped out into stockpiles, got the -- I mean, if those of you who know Akyem's a long, narrow pit and so is where as we're getting the last of the ore from the bottom of the pit and the current layback and wanting to bring down the next layback. We want to make sure that we maximize that also. We stepped out of the pit, made sure catch benches and the like rolling good shape. And swung into the stock -- the stockpiles we would have been in, in the fourth quarter. And now we're back in that ore. And so we basically got right of mine grade ore from the bottom of the pit coming through. You'll see most of that through the -- as now you see a good portion of that through the build through the third and fourth quarter now. It's the highest grades in the fourth quarter, building up through the third.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then lastly, at Cerro Negro. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So 30% increase in tons mined and 50% increase in grade. But I don't think Rob said which quarter it was. Is that -- does that start in Q3, or is it Q4 weighted?
Tom Palmer: We see the step-up in grade at Cerro Negro pretty consistent through the third and fourth quarter at Cerro Negro. And then you'll actually see -- you see quite a step-up in tons mined as we've got more ability to access ore, particularly as we start to extract ore from San Marcos for the first time. So pretty consistent second half across Q3 and Q4, in terms of material coming through the mill and the grades looking pretty consistent through those two quarters from correct to the back.
Anita Soni: Okay. Thanks. I’ll leave it there. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Anita, probably one other on Ahafo. We've got the -- we've got the stars really lining up in terms of the real sweet spot in the Subika open pit as well as now having the third level of Subika underground open more than 20 draw points open. So we've got both the combination of high grades and tonnes coming out of open pit and underground at Ahafo. So it's another important one to be thinking about as you think about second half of the year. But that's certainly fourth quarter weighted as that comes through building through the third or the fourth quarter is a strong one at Ahafo with the stars lining up in both open and underground with mine sequences.
Anita Soni: Okay. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Mike Parkin of National Bank. Mike, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mike Parkin: Yes, thanks. Can you just give a bit more color in terms of the background on pausing at Cerro Negro in mining? And does it have with what you've kind of investigated and decided on a go-forward basis, does it have any material impact on the cost structure of that asset going forward?
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Mike, certainly, absolutely no impact on cost structure going forward. It was from time to time, certainly, my experience and Rob's experience you'll get an event, and we had a significant potential event in the underground mine and involved a loader that we weren't happy that we had the control environment in to be managing as the standard that we'd expect around -- basically, it was a piece of equipment involved in an incident. It's a remote mine. As you know, Cerro Negro is in a very remote part of Argentina and Patagonia. And we wanted to ensure that the standards that we expect, we're clear across the four crews that were there and that we went through the underground mine and did the appropriate inspections to make sure that equipment and conditions underground were well understood. You're obviously working underground in a remote location. So it's briefly important that we can be satisfied that the expectations are well understood and the conditions underground are well understood. We're also entering into a second half, which is a step-up in both grade and tons. So we're moving into a period of time where we're going to be asking the team to step up and be working more fronts. So we took the time to ensure that conditions were clear and expectations were set. There's nothing in terms of additional cost base. It's more about just ensuring that the leaders at all levels and their mining teams are understanding the standards that we expect and that we can confidently move forward with mining what will be a strong second half at Cerro Negro.
Mike Parkin: Okay, great. So pretty much to sum up, it's more kind of ensuring operational best practices of Newmont being executed at that site?
Tom Palmer: That's right, Mike. We will do that from time-to-time in my experience. There are times when you must always maintain a chronic unease with safety, and there will be events that come from time-to-time and part of maintaining solid safety performance is recognizing when you may need to just pause and ensure everyone's got their mind on the game, understand what's expected and then move forward with confidence. And so that's something we do from time-to-time. Certainly, Cerro Negro we cited that this needed a couple of weeks down. I'd expect as we do our integration planning for Newcrest and think about five new operations coming into our portfolio, think about the work we might do through November and December. That's certainly one of the debates we're having in terms of how do we ensure that the standards that we expect at Newmont are there in place in day one of those new crystal operations. So it's something that certainly both Rob and I have done in our careers from time-to-time when we see a need to reset expectations.
Mike Parkin: Okay, excellent. And just one question on Peñasquito. With respect to the stream, is there any minimum delivery of silver that you're tied to, or are you fully free to shut down and not deliver sulphur when you're not producing?
Tom Palmer: That's correct. That's my understanding, Mike, we'll get the team to just run that to ground. And it's different from that, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.
Mike Parkin: Okay. That’s it from me guys. Thanks so much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Tanya, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Peñasquito, just to get some clarification just from so many news articles that keep coming out. I'm just trying to understand with the union being on June 8th. I just want to make sure that I understood some of the articles that came out. Has the union gone to paying the workers? Because my understanding was the workers aren't being paid being on strike that the union has gone into pay the workers. Do we know if that's a correct statement from some of the papers I was reading?
Tom Palmer: Tanya, that's correct. The members, the union members who are on strike are not being paid by the union that they're members of. And as part of our position at the negotiating table, we're not paying back pay.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So the union is not paying and you're not paying. So they haven't been paid since June 8th.
TOM PALMER: That's right. So workforce of some 2,000 people aren’t being paid. You've got a much bigger contractor workforce that aren't being paid. You've got an extended community, there's some 28,000 people that rely upon those wages to receive some benefits. They're not being paid. We're the biggest taxpayer in the state of Zacatecas. They're not getting taxes. And our contributions are close to $2 billion a year to the Mexican government through both taxes and royalties are not currently being paid. So our message to the union leadership is we have a fair and equitable agreement. We paid in accordance with that, and we strongly encourage them to get their members back to work so that we can start paying wages again.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Yeah, it's just there was an article, Tom, that's saying that the union leader -- the union was taking money from their coffers and paying the workers. I just wanted to clarify that. And just how should we think about the cost of the -- on a monthly basis, being on care and maintenance as we go into July, how should I think, number one, what sort of cost should I be thinking about you incurring on care and maintenance? And number two, would that be coming through the operating costs, or would you take that out and put it under other? Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Yeah. Thanks, Anita. So we -- you'll see -- and I'll get Daniel to catch up with you after the call, but we've got something in our earnings release. If you think about those costs through the month of June, at Peñasquito, we incurred $23 million of operating costs, another $15 million in depreciation due to the suspension of operations. So it's down for most of June. That's a pretty good indicator of what that's going to look like.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And I would run that through the cost. You're not going to take it out separately. Sometimes you've taken it out and included it out of operating costs into other items.
Tom Palmer: No, we don't plan to do that, Tanya. So what you described is how best to model it.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Thank you for that. And then if I could just go back to Anita's question on just the second half performance with some of the mines that I think Cerro Negro would be evenly distributed Ahafo and Mussel are going to get higher Q4. Is there any other operation that going to have a higher Q4 because when I look at the numbers, you're looking at a production profile of Q4 being significantly stronger than Q3. Is that how I should think about it?
Tom Palmer: That's right. Tanya, we're building towards a strong fourth quarter you've got -- you'll have across some of the parts of the world in which we operate, you tend to get a bit more wet weather in the third quarter. So you typically see us have those drier locations that really bring it home in the fourth quarter. Pueblo Viejo ramping up with 40% of Pueblo Viejo. That's an important part of H2, Nevada Gold Mines guiding to a strong second half. That's an important part of our H2. Tanami, we have got pretty consistent tons through the mill in the second half, but we move into our highest grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So that's an important story. And I think we probably covered the most of the Merian certainly got a stronger second pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4. So I think we've covered the sort of the key drivers of H1 versus H2 and where the higher fourth quarter would come from.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. No, I appreciate that. It's just when you look at the production profile, excluding Peñasquito depending on what happens there, it is looking at the fourth quarter is the one that is going to carry quite a bit of weight for your -- in order to get your guidance.
Tom Palmer: That's right, Tanya. And were -- 
Tanya Jakusconek: If I could just do one final question.
Tom Palmer: Go ahead, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Sorry. Just 
Tom Palmer: Go for it, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Sorry, I cut you to say something else. Just another follow-up on Greg's questions on the inflationary release that you are seeing. I just wanted to confirm because some companies are not seeing exactly the same thing. Would be also fair to say that you are seeing cyanide pricing coming down relative to what you have? And I just kind of wonder in your agreement, do we restock your inventories on these lower level prices that are out there. Some contracts for some come up in three months, six months. I'm just wondering how -- when we are expecting you to renegotiate at these lower levels, so we can see when those would go through your cost structure?
Tom Palmer: So, Tanya, we -- our supply chain strategy, particularly with our key commodities is to have strategic contracts that are long-term based upon the size of our portfolio, and we built into those rise in full calculations. So, we pretty much then become a price taker, but at a competitive price. And, then we -- and then we'll have flowed through the -- as you see prices go up and down, we have some relief in terms of the volatility about price increases or price decreases. And then with the inventories we have at sites, and it takes a little while for that to flow through. So, we are -- on the back of natural gas prices coming off, we are seeing ammonia prices down, caustic soda prices are also down, and we are seeing improvement in both cyanide cost and explosive costs. So, that is flowing through and it's linked to -- linked back to that key commodity price, and it's flowing through our contracts. It will wash through our inventories and we just continue to, through those contracts, take the prices as we have agreed in those contracts, and that then takes normally a month or two or three to flow through our inventories.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And so those you could see them coming in, in Q3 and into Q4?
Tom Palmer: Yes, yes, we'll see some of that benefit in Q3 and Q4, absolutely.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Great. Thank you. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya.
Operator: Thank you. The next question goes to Brian MacArthur of Raymond James. Brian, please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian MacArthur: Good morning. Can I just follow up on Peñasquito. Tanya covered the ongoing cost, but where is the concentrate situation? Is there concentrate in transit that's off-site that's provisionally priced and you're going to have some sales in Q3 if nothing happens, or I was looking at your sales versus your production, and I know it varies quarter-by-quarter and lead versus zinc, where are we on that? Is there actually a cash inflow to you from concentrator? Is it all stuck at side, or where is that situation at the moment?
Tom Palmer: Hey, good morning Brian. So, there's nothing left to put in all the sales being recognized in the second quarter. So, there's nothing in the supply chain from the mine site to the smelters that hasn't been sold and recognized. And then we have a small amount of concentrate stockpile on site, but not much. Sites been put into care and maintenance in very good neck and everything is safe and secure onsite. So, the expectation that common sense prevails and we've got a workforce back at work. We can ramp up very quickly with a lot of experience in being able to ramp up from the pandemic days. So, we know how to get that big mine back up and running and producing concentrate very quickly. So, it's pretty clean in terms of where we sit with the concentrates.
Brian MacArthur: Great. Thanks very much, Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Brian.
Operator: Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anita Soni: Sure. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So a few more questions in terms of the details. At Tanami, could you just go over what you're looking for in terms of grades and tonnes in the Q4, Q3?
Tom Palmer: No problems, Tanya. The Q3…
Anita Soni: Anita.
Tom Palmer: Sorry, sorry. I live in the flow.
Anita Soni: And you called Tanya, Anita.
Tom Palmer: Daniel was writing me notes, Tanya, if you're still listening, my apologies, and I needed my apologies. Obviously, I need a holiday, sorry, how embarrassed. The high grades are in the fourth quarter. You'll actually see a little bit of a step up in the third quarter from what we were able to see in the second, and then we get into some nice high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So pretty consistent through the mill and a step-up in the in third and fourth quarter as they're free and clear of some of the disruption from the weather in the first half. So you see a step-up in volumes through the mill but the real grades flow in the fourth quarter. Nothing outrageous. Certainly, well within the grades that we've seen historically.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then in terms of the project, I was noticing the spend at the different projects. And Tanami looks -- I mean, I don't really -- we don't really have sort of like the -- or maybe I've lost track of the amount of time that it's going to take to build out these projects, we are in the process like a percentage just from a time standpoint. But Ahafo North, it seems like the spend is not -- it's got the same start-up at Tanami expansion and I only see about 30% of the -- 3% of the spend and where Tanami's that has to spend. So could you just give us a little color on the time frame and the cadence of spending at both Tanami and Ahafo North?
Tom Palmer: Sure. I'll start off Anita, and Rob might want to build on this. But Ahafo North has really been a first half or a quarter of just getting the work fronts opened up. So a lot of clearing of land, bringing equipment in. And so gearing up with positioning ourselves to really get stuck into doing the pre-strip work and then the civil works will then start constructing the processing plant and other infrastructure. So it's in a process of gearing up and then be able to accelerate up in terms of an open pit mine with a processing plant. Tanami, where is probably -- we're in that serious process of stepping through the shaft, doing those -- doing the concrete line and then bringing in the various facilities that get attached to that concrete wall. So that's in now starting to get a pretty steady state for that critical path item. The other thing that's largely the surface work in terms of most infrastructure is largely done. So clearly, there's a whole bunch of winding equipment to install at the appropriate time on surface and not completely done. But at Tanami, we've got the underground excavation, it's all done, but you're really in that process now mobilizing those construction crews underground to start building out the conveyors and the crushers and all the supporting infrastructure for that. So gearing up to get that work front really going ahead. So quite different projects in terms of infrastructure underground, shaft lining and then building an open pit mine and the associated infrastructure. Rob, anything you add on that?
Rob Atkinson: Anita, I would just emphasize what Tom said, a number of fronts that we're actively working on at Tanami is far larger than Ahafo North. So every part of that project is getting worked on. And as Tom said, Ahafo North and seeing it just a month or so ago, the civil works is progressing very, very well. And in the coming months, that's when we will see significant spend, whether it be the contractors coming in. It's the steel getting erected. It's the hiring of cranes, it's the digging of tranches, et cetera, it's the construction of the tailings dams. So as the next few months passes, the number of fronts that we start working on at Ahafo North significantly increases. And as such, we'll see that increase in spend as well.
Anita Soni: And then in terms of that work, how much has been sort of like, I guess, committed or how much of that work in the next -- in the back half of this year and early next year, do you have a visibility on the cost level?
Rob Atkinson: In terms of, Anita...
Anita Soni: I guess I'm just trying to understand that if you haven't – yes, what I was trying to understand is if you haven't really started getting into the guts of it, how certain are you that the CapEx guidance range is still good?
Rob Atkinson: The key thing, which I'd certainly see, Anita, is that on the procurement side of things that we have basically secured just about all the supplies for both the projects. And I think that protects us enormously. The engineering that we've also done on both projects is at a significant level as well. So we've got a large degree of confidence. The biggest thing is always is with shaft building. We progressed down there. And at the moment, we're aligning that very well. We've got patches of overbreak, which we'll deal with. But at the moment, because of the engineering, the procurement, we're still very much on track.
Anita Soni: Thank you. That’s all my questions.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, operator. Just a quick one for Mike Parkin's question. Just confirm there's no minimum payment on the silver stream, Mike, if you're still listing on the call. Thank you all for making the time for the call this quarter, and please enjoy the rest of your day, and thank you for your time. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's first quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Brian Tabolt, along with other members of our executive leadership team and will all be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont continues to lead the gold industry in safety, sustainability, profitable production and shareholder returns. Our solid first quarter performance is underpinned by our unmatched portfolio of world-class assets, our proven operating model, a balanced, disciplined approach to capital allocation and most importantly, our values-driven commitment to leading sustainability practices. With a strong outlook, combined with the strength of our team and the quality of our assets, we remain on track to continue safely delivering long-term value to all of our stakeholders. During the first quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 288,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and all in line with the expectations we provided in February for Q1. We continue to expect the gold production for this year will be weighted 55% to the second half and we remain firmly on track to achieve our full year guidance ranges. With $6.5 billion in total liquidity, we continue to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet providing the financial strength to sustain our business throughout the price cycle as we continue to invest in our most profitable growth projects and return cash to our shareholders. Through our established dividend framework, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and the confidence that we have in our business. During the first quarter, we further rationalized Newmont's portfolio with the sale of our interest in Triple Flag, generating $179 million in cash proceeds. And we remain on track to deliver an incremental $440 million of full potential cost of productivity improvements this year. A key part of Newmont's continued efforts to deliver stable production and strong margins from the industry's best portfolio of world-class assets. Our core values are safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility. They have been developed and embedded over a long period of time and through multiple generations of leaders at Newmont. Together, they are fundamental to how we run our business, where we choose to operate and how we conduct ourselves on a daily basis. Last week, Newmont launched our 19th Annual Sustainability Report and our second Annual Taxes and Royalties Contribution Report providing a detailed and transparent look at our values-driven approach to sustainability and an overview of our tax strategy and economic contributions. And next month, we will issue our third annual climate report, outlining Newmont's climate risks and opportunities, our strategic planning around various climate change scenarios and the specific actions we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint. Each of these reports are part of a robust set to detail our company's management of the sustainability areas that matter most to our stakeholders and to our business. At the very core of Newmont's leading sustainability practices is our commitment to driving a fatality, injury and illness-free workplace. And this begins with a disciplined, laser focus on safety fundamentals. In the first quarter, we completed more than 172,000 interactions by leaders in the field that were focused on the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. To highlight one of the direct consequences of this work compared to the same quarter last year, in Q1, we experienced a 56% reduction in potentially fatal incidents or what we call significant potential events. This improvement could not have been achieved without our dedicated workforce and the supporting systems that we have in place to maintain and improve our safety culture. Last month, we recognized several members of our team through our Annual CEO Safety Awards, acknowledging those teams and individuals that set the standard for high-quality build and safety practices. From a pool of over 50 nominees, we selected winners in three categories: safe lead up, safe team and partner in safety. We are really proud to be able to recognize the dedication demonstrated by our team members each and every day. We are also proud of our heritage as a values-driven organization with a clear purpose. We have learned that achieving our purpose requires strong governance and a commitment to accountability and transparency. As part of that commitment, Newmont has been disclosing our sustainability performance since 2004. Among the key highlights shown on this slide from our 2022 sustainability report is one of the most important focus areas for the mining industry today, creating a safe, healthy and equitable workplace, one that values our differences and ensures that everyone feels safe and is safe working at Newmont. Over the last 18 months, the mining industry has come under significant scrutiny following a West Australian Parliamentary inquiry into issues of sexism, racism, harassment and bullying in the workplace. I'm disappointed to acknowledge that Newmont is not immune to this unacceptable behavior that is taking place in workplaces across the world. And it is vital that its leaders, we make sustainable changes to address and eliminate these behaviors. To manage our response last year, I appointed a senior operational leader reporting directly to me and tasked with listening to our workforce to better understand what is being experienced so that we can make lasting and meaningful change. Over the last few months, more than 1,000 people have provided thoughtful feedback and personal experiences through 100 focus groups and more than 150 one-on-one interviews, assisting us in understanding the extent, nature and root cause of these behaviors in our organization. We will remain transparent in our acknowledgment of these behaviors. Andrew provided an overview of the emerging themes from these conversations in our annual sustainability report. This ask and listen process is helping us to identify the improvements required in our systems, the symbolic actions that we can take and our changes in our leadership behaviors that will drive a sustainable change in our workplaces. I'll now turn it over to Rob and then Brian to take us through each of our operations and key development projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Then I'll wrap up with a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Newcrest.  Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Since the start of the year, I visited three of our four regions at Newmont. I spent underground with the team at Tanami, reviewing the status of our expansion project to this world-class asset with Mia Gous, our Senior Vice President in Australia and our experienced leadership team. I traveled to Ghana to see firsthand progress at our Subika Underground mine and our Ahafo North project with Dave Thornton, our Senior Vice President in Africa. And I also traveled to each one of our sites in Canada, Éléonore, Musselwhite and Porcupine to review the productivity improvements we are achieving under the leadership of our North American Senior Vice President, Bernard Wessels. And as Tom just described, our site and regional leaders are very focused on safely delivering their plans, whilst continually working to create a safe and inclusive environment for each person working at our operations. So turning to the next slide. Let's begin with an update from South America. Peñasquito continues to deliver strong mill performance largely due to the implementation of our full potential program over the last four years and with the ongoing support from our operations support networks. With more than $300 million in annual synergies from processing, improvements alone, our team has been hard at work further debottlenecking Peñasquito's processing circuit, improving flotation and filtering capacity as well as optimizing maintenance schedules to increase mill availability. And as a direct result, Peñasquito processed 9.9 million tonnes in the first quarter, putting us on track to mill an impressive 37 million tonnes of ore in 2023. Mining continues in the Chile Colorado pit as planned. And whilst gold production was lower when compared to the fourth quarter, it was completely in line with the expectations that we had previously communicated due to mine sequence at this very large polymetallic mine. Linked to this sequence, coal production was strong this quarter, generating $266 million in revenue due to higher silver, lead and zinc grades being delivered from the Chile Colorado pit. And also, please note that 55,000 gold equivalent ounces in finished goods inventory at Peñasquito was built up at the end of the quarter as a result of planned timing on concentrate shipments. This concentrate has since been sold and the revenue will be realized in the second quarter. Also in Q2, we expect both gold and silver grades to decline by around 10% compared to Q1 due to the planned mining sequence with the full expectation that higher silver, zinc and lead grades in the second half and resulting gold equivalent ounces will offset the planned lower gold grades in 2023. We expect gold and coal production at Peñasquito to be weighted around 55% to the second half of this year. Turning to our leach-only operations in Peru. Yanacocha delivered steady results in the first quarter. Production is expected to increase by more than 20% beginning in the second quarter when we start to realize the benefits from our continued use of our injection leaching technology combined with our re-leaching programs. At Merian, our team has begun the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and as reflected in our guidance, this will result in higher waste tonnes being mined and lower ore tonnes in ore grade being processed this year. And finally, in Argentina, Cerro Negro delivered another solid quarter due to higher underground mining rates and mill throughput. Gold production is expected to steadily increase each quarter from a combination of sustained productivity improvements and the progression of the first wave of our district expansions at Cerro Negro. We anticipate production will be weighted around 56% to the second half of this year, with the site on track to add high-grade ounces from San Marcos beginning in the third quarter. Now turning to Australia. Boddington continued its momentum from the fourth quarter, delivering strong gold and copper production in the first quarter, whilst also completing a planned 7-day preventative maintenance shutdown of the processing plant. And as we look ahead, the site is expected to deliver improved results during the second quarter, supported by steady ore grades and strong mill performance. And as we ramp up waste stripping in the South pit in the second half of the year, we expect to increase total material amount to around 20 million tonnes per quarter helping to maintain steady gold and copper production despite planned lower ore grades being delivered to the mill. Now moving up to Tanami. And as previously discussed, the Northern territory in Australia experienced record wet weather and associated extensive flooding during late 2022 and the start of 2023, which resulted in the complete closure of the main route for supplies to Tanami from late December with the Tanami track only being fully unable to transport normal loads in late February. As described during our last earnings call, this road closure impacted our ability to move key consumables to site, resulting in the depletion of all of our wet weather stocks on site and the [cessation] of milling operations and gold production for 32 days during Q1. However, during this period, our team remained agile and responded to this event with mining operations continuing and ore being stockpiled in front of the mill. Scheduled maintenance was moved forward to reduce downtime in subsequent quarters. And in partnership with the Northern territory government and local contractors we successfully repaired and reopened the Tanami track. Due to these efforts, Tanami expects to recover most of the ounces from this event over the course of 2023 and is on track to more than double gold production in the second quarter. It's also important to note that all our key consumable stocks at site have returned to normal operating levels and we have continued to progress our second expansion at Tanami. The team has now completed more than 565 meters of the concrete shaft lining in addition to account expansion to accommodate our current and future workforce. And despite the temporary closure of the main access route during the quarter, the project remains on track to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements in the second half of 2025. And now moving to Africa. Akyem delivered lower ore grade in the first quarter as our team commenced stripping of the next layback in line with the expectations previously communicated. Strip ratios will remain high throughout the year as planned with stronger gold production expected in the second and third quarters due to higher grades coming through. At Ahafo, we delivered a solid quarter, a strong mining rates and plant throughput partially offset lower grades due to planned underground rehabilitation that impacted access to high-grade material at the Subika Underground. During Q1, the site experienced a conveyor failure that impacted one of the two conveyor systems transporting ore from the secondary crusher to the mills. However, the team was able to put a system in place to bypass conveyor and offset any impact to production. As a result, the hassle remains on track to achieve its annual guidance range with steady increases to production each quarter still expected as we open up additional draw points on the Subika Underground. We anticipate gold production at Ahafo will be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year due to higher mining rates and the delivery of more high-grade ore to the mill over the course of the year. Our Ahafo North project continues to progress well with approximately 85% of the total land area available for construction. And as you can see in the photo on this slide, we have transported a large portion of the necessary civil construction and mining equipment from Ahafo South to Ahafo North as we prepare to develop this next important phase of our Ahafo complex in Ghana. Now moving across to North America. As discussed during our last earnings call, our North American operations have made tremendous progress due to the guidance from our experienced team of leaders, the strength of our integrated operating model and the support from our proven full potential program. Starting with CC&V, our leach-only operation remains a solid contributor with slightly lower production compared to the previous quarter due to waste stripping in the Global Hill pit as planned. At Éléonore, the site delivered another strong quarter, driven by improved mining rates and mill performance compared to the fourth quarter. And these improvements, combined with the progress we have made in workforce stability, will enable Éléonore to continue generating daily production levels throughout the year, more than offsetting planned lower oral grid. Musselwhite delivered lower ore grade and mining rates compared to the fourth quarter as the team focused on backfill activities to expose higher grade stopes. And when combined with the efficiency improvements achieved through double lift stoping, Musselwhite is expected to deliver increased production each quarter in 2023 with nearly 56% of production anticipated in the second half of the year. And finally, Porcupine delivered higher ore grade and improved tonnes mine, largely offsetting the impact on planned mill maintenance during the first quarter. Pamour project continues to progress well as we prepare for an investment decision in late 2023. Collectively, our Canadian sites have improved production by 26% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to continued focus on closely managing labor vacancies and absenteeism, whilst improving productivity and reliability with greater access for our leadership and full potential teams post the Canadian border restrictions. Éléonore, Musselwhite and Porcupine each achieved the highest quarterly performance in terms of development meters. And for comparison, this is an overall improvement of 37% versus Q1 2022. And also as a direct consequence, tonnes mined improved 26% and ore tonnes processed also increased 7%. These very pleasing results are a true testament to the power of our operating model and its ability to replicate leading practices across our global operations. And these improvements will be on just the ounces delivered, we have also seen the significant potential event frequency rate in our four North American operations cut in half due to an increased focus on critical control verifications, proving once again that a strong safety culture is key to delivering on our commitments. Finally, to our two non-managed joint ventures, our 38.5% ownership of Nevada Gold Mines and 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 321,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter, representing 20% of our combined non-managed joint venture production guidance for the full year. As highlighted at our full year earnings presentation in February, a tragic workplace fatality occurred in our joint venture in Nevada Gold Mines. The fatality occurred at the Carlin Gold stream underground operation on the 23rd of January and a detailed investigation was carried out by our JV partners, which included one of Newmont's most senior safety leaders as a key member of the investigation team. And Newmont's executive leaders have also met to discuss and share safety strategies, interventions and tactics to help ensure tragedies of this nature do not occur again at NGM. Both of these joint ventures are core to the Newmont portfolio, and we look forward to continuing to work with our managing partner to help ensure a safe and productive future for Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo. And with that, I'll pass it over to Brian to cover our financial results. Over to you, Brian.
Brian Tabolt : Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the financial highlights. In the first quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,906 per ounce, driven from 21% of our anticipated full year production and including $376 million from our copper, silver, lead and zinc coproducts; adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion and cash from operations of $481 million, which includes $360 million of unfavorable working capital movements, partly due to the timing of concentrate shipments at Peñasquito. As stated previously, we are currently in a period of meaningful reinvestment with capital spend for the first quarter of $526 million as we continue to progress our near-term projects and position our portfolio to be profitable and resilient for decades to come. Additionally, through the continued rationalization of our portfolio, we sold our stake in Triple Flag, which generated $179 million of proceeds, contributing to Newmont's strong liquidity profile at the end of the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This investment-grade balance sheet continues to be an integral part of our capital allocation strategy, maintaining financial strength and flexibility, while balancing sustainable reinvestment and meeting shareholder returns. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $339 million or $0.42 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to a gain from the sale of our interest in Triple Flag as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization, $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and $0.08 related to tax adjustments. Taking these into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.40 per diluted share, relatively in line with the previous quarter despite lower production as planned and previously communicated. These results also include the impact from higher average realized price, lower sales volumes, including the impact from the timing of concentrate sales at Peñasquito, as mentioned earlier, and lower total cost applicable to sales driven by lower overall production and higher oil prices. And as a reminder, this higher gold price environment results in both favorable inventory adjustments as well as higher royalties and production taxes. As the year progresses, we anticipate that unit costs will decline as production increases and inflationary pressures stabilized, improving margins and strengthening our financial position. As a reflection of the confidence in our business and our strong financial position, this morning, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, set within our established framework and in line with our fourth quarter dividend. This continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector and remains within the top 20% of large-cap dividend payers in S&P 500. With this dividend declared, Newmont will have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends since introducing our framework in October 2020. And we have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 10 consecutive quarters. And with that, I'll pass it back to Tom.
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Brian. I'd now like to provide an update on our potential acquisition of Newcrest. To briefly recap the key events and milestones over the last three months, on February 5, Newmont confirmed that we had submitted a nonbinding proposal to acquire Newcrest. Then on February 15, Newcrest advised that they had rejected our proposal, but offered to provide us access to limited non-public information. After negotiating an appropriate nondisclosure agreement, we were provided access to this information. As part of this process, my executive leadership team and I, along with some of our key subject matter experts, held a face-to-face meeting with the Newcrest management team. After reviewing this additional information, we submitted a revised nonbinding proposal to the Board of Newcrest with the following terms: a proposal to acquire 100% of the issued share capital by way of an Australian scheme of arrangement under which Newcrest shareholders would receive 0.4 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share. Newcrest would have the right to fund and paid shareholders special dividend of up to US$1.10 per share to realize the value of franking credits and that the Newmont offer is best and final, subject only to no superior proposal emerging. On April 10, the Newcrest Board then agreed to grant Newmont access to confirmatory due diligence to enable us to put forward a binding proposal. Newmont has been provided exclusivity for a four-week due diligence period that ends at midnight on May 11. Our proposed acquisition would combine the assets and talent of two of the sectors of senior gold producers and set the new standard for safe, profitable and responsible gold mining. Newmont has a long history and a shared heritage with Newcrest, establishing our Australian subsidiary way back in 1966, a subsidiary that would become Newcrest some 25 years later. And as part of that share history, our companies also have shared commitments to a strong safety culture and leading sustainability practices, which is in addition to the complementary portfolios of world-class assets located in low-risk mining jurisdictions. Our proposed acquisition would strengthen our established position in Australia, creating efficiencies and value with a shared workforce, technical expertise and large-scale supply chain optimization and it would build upon the district potential in British Columbia's highly prospective golden triangle through a combination of operating mines and development projects that would deliver value through shared technology, mobile capabilities and ore body expense. With our scale and track record of successfully managing some of the world's top Tier 1 assets, this transaction would leverage Newmont's experience from the Goldcorp acquisition, where we have demonstrated over the last four years that we can generate meaningful improvements to performance, stability and profitability, especially at large open pit and underground operations. Since we closed the Goldcorp acquisition just over four years ago on April 18, 2019, we have delivered more than $1 billion in annual synergies, significantly exceeding our initial commitment of $365 million. More than 3/4 of this synergy value was generated by focusing on the fundamentals of mining and processing, and achieved for the disciplined application of our proven full potential program and leveraging our Newmont operating model with an experienced team of leaders and subject matter experts.  Peñasquito, as the only Tier 1 asset in the Goldcorp acquisition, has been the main driver of this value, generating more than $700 million in annual synergies. At this very large open pit mine, we have increased the average payload on our fleet of 85 large 330-tonne haul trucks by 17 tonnes per load with scope for further improvement. This translates to an additional 12 million tonnes of material moved per year for next to zero cost. Combined with other load-and-hold improvements, we have increased the annual total material moved at Peñasquito by more than 20% compared to 2020 with no additional equipment.  Then turning to the processing plant at Peñasquito, we have worked to understand and then address the bottlenecks in the crushing, grinding and flotation circuits of this complex polymetallic operation, delivering a 7% increase in annual throughput compared to 2020, which translates to around $300 million in free cash flow improvements each year from this operation. The Goldcorp acquisition involved the integration of five new operations, of which one Peñasquito was a Tier 1 asset. It also involved the entry into three new jurisdictions. By comparison, our proposed acquisition of Newcrest would also involve the integration of five new operations; but importantly, only one new jurisdiction. And notably, two of the operations, Cadia and Lihir are Tier 1 assets with Red Chris and Brucejack representing a Tier 1 district in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. In the four years since April 2019, we have delivered on our value proposition and exceeded the commitments that we made. We have strengthened our position as the industry's recognized responsible gold leader. We have enhanced our portfolio through the successful integration of the former Goldcorp assets into our Newmont operating model delivering over $1 billion in annual synergies. We have optimized our portfolio, generating over $2 billion in proceeds from the divestments of Red Lake, our share of both KCGM and Continental Gold, along with the continued rationalization of our noncore equity portfolio. Notably, $1.5 billion of the proceeds from these divestments was delivered within the first 12 months of the acquisition closing, and we have led the industry on capital returns, returning more than $5.5 billion to shareholders over the last four years, while also completing over $1.5 billion in opportunistic share buybacks. Finally, our successful integration of the Goldcorp assets goes far beyond the synergies, assets investments and leading shareholder returns. We have led the alignment of the former Goldcorp organization with Newmont's purpose, values, experience and culture. We have fully implemented Newmont's safety systems and processes. We have integrated our sustainability goals and targets. Through our disciplined capital allocation process, the former Goldcorp assets have significantly benefited from the combined entity's free cash flow generation capability, and we have learned to operate in three new jurisdictions and forge lasting community and host country relationships. So in closing, I'm not able to provide any further details on the Newcrest proposal at this time as it is a live engagement. But I want to be clear with everyone on today's call that we will continue to be disciplined as we work through the due diligence process and determine synergies, and we will act in the best interest of our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. And with that, I now turn it over to the operator to open up the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jackie Przybylowski from BMO Capital Markets.
Jackie Przybylowski : Thanks very much for taking my question and I'm going to apologize because I acknowledge that you've just mentioned you don't want to give more information about the Newcrest transaction. But if I could ask on that anyway. Let's say, you finished the due diligence on the schedule where the exclusivity period is still intact and it's approved by all shareholders, can you talk a little bit about the time line for sort of when the earliest transaction closing would be and sort of what your thoughts would be for integration of the assets?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Jackie. I tend to answer that question as best I can, whilst respecting the need for that the ability -- the restrictions on being able to comment. We will certainly, in due diligence -- so first and foremost, we'll go through that due diligence process is exclusivity period for four weeks, but we remain disciplined in terms of understanding that information and assessing that and making our judgments and decisions. And it is a core capability of Newmont. We have a -- part of our operating model is the capability of our operating and technical teams. And so when it comes to due diligence, we have a very strong team who are very experienced in doing this work. So we're applying the full force of the Newmont organization on this due diligence exercise and we will work diligently through that process and then make our judgments, assuming that they will work well and -- sorry, Jackie.
Jackie Przybylowski : Sorry, Sorry, sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Tom Palmer : Sorry, Jackie. Assuming that progresses well, and we were -- we reached a binding agreement, then there would be the regulatory approvals to work through. We've got the Australian, the Papua New Guinea, the United States and Canada. And so it really becomes an understanding of those approval pathways and ultimately, moving to close is dependent upon that. That's still a little bit into the future and work in progress. So that normally takes a few months to work through those steps. In terms of one of the real strengths of -- and the strategic rationale of this deal of which there are many, one of the real strengths is that we already have an operating model and an infrastructure in Australia and in Canada. So if you think about an integration exercise, we already have meals and a full business unit operating out of Australia. General managers report to me. We have a finance team, an HR team, a legal team, a sustainability and external relations team and technical team. So an integration in Australia involves two operations becoming part of Mia's team. She currently has Boddington and Tanami. When I was RSVP down in Australia, we had Boddington, Tanami, we had Waihi over in New Zealand, we had Jundee, we had KCGM. So we're scalable in terms of being able to accommodate additional operations, exactly the same circumstance plays out in Canada, where we already have Éléonore, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Cripple Creek and Victor reporting through to Bernard Wessels and his North American leadership team. So again, Brucejack and Red Chris can fit very comfortably into that scalable organization. For Lihir, Papua New Guinea is a new jurisdiction, very similar to when we're in Indonesia with Batu Hijau. I joined Newmont over nine years ago as the Senior Vice President for Indonesia, based in Jakarta, managing the external relations with Indonesia and the Batu Hijau operation. And I think there are some analogies between how I think about or how we think about Lihir and PNG and what we did very successfully for many, many years in Indonesia.  So Jackie, hopefully, that gives you some flavor of how we think about integration.
Jackie Przybylowski : No that's helpful. Tom, I mean, I think when you talked -- or when the media talked about this transaction initially, the thought was sort of a year-end or early '24 closing. But I would expect that as this process has gone on, that gets pushed back. Is that fair like you'd be kind of mid-2024 at the earliest third time frame? I'm just thinking from a modeling perspective.
Tom Palmer : Yes, Jackie, I think that's too far into the future as best you can look into the crystal ball the work of those approval process. It's still -- we're in the hands of working through appropriate those approval processes, but I think it's a shorter time frame than what you just articulated.
Jackie Przybylowski : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up question or a related question. You mentioned maybe potential sanctioning decision or investment decision for Pamour in late '23. And I know previously, you've talked about Yanacocha Sulfides investment decision as well. Can you talk a little bit about like what your what you're going to be looking for either independently of this Newcrest transaction or potentially in light of this Newcrest transaction? What you're looking for in order to make a positive sanction decision on the projects that you've got in your portfolio today?
Tom Palmer : Yes. Thanks, Jackie. Maybe I'll talk specifically to Pamour. I mean Pamour is a layback of an existing open pit. So it's really -- as we deplete the ore out of Hollinger in the middle of Timmins and we move across to Pamour, that we're already dewatering as part of the closure plans, then Pamour is really Hollinger's replacement in terms of the provision of the lower grade ore to supplement ore -- on -- it's a high grade underground ore through the mill of Porcupine. So it’s a very straightforward layback open pit replacement investment decision. We are just working through the diligent process of reaching -- working towards full fronts at the end of the year. We got some early long lead items coming in in terms of getting some fleet on the ground as the water comes out of that pit to able to get a good start at that. So that sort of sits there independent of anything else that maybe happening. It’s just natural progression of the veins in that mine and that decision -- assuming it continues to meet our hurdle rates, we will enable Porcupine to run for many more years to come profitably.  Yanacocha Sulfides, we have got Dean Gehring, still dedicated to that, Chief Development Officer Peru, focused on understanding all options for the Yanacocha Sulfides through to and including, not presenting with the project and putting it into care or maintenance and Dean is still diligently working through that process with the team in Peru. And we have got a second half of '24 decision to be made there. So that is also independent of already a team that maybe happening externally, that is a process that Dean will continue to work through with that timeframe in mind.  More generally, if we were to be successful in the acquisition, I would point you to our track record with Goldcorp where within the first 12 months we did work to rationalized the portfolio and to look to resequence projects so that we stayed true to our capital allocation strategy in terms of the strength of our balance sheet, a steady reinvestment in the business and leading returns to our shareholders. And that would be the same strategy that we would apply if we were in a situation where we were working through an integration of a combined portfolio.  The mantra at Newmont which has been a key philosophy of how we approach our work for well over a decade is value over volume and value over volume would apply if this transaction would have been successful. 
Operator: We now have Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. 
Tanya Jakusconek : Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I am just going to circle back Tom if I can just on the Newcrest potential acquisition. Just wanted to check with you, do we not require also Mexican approval for that as well or is that not needed?
Tom Palmer : No, I don’t believe there Mexican approval is needed, Tanya. I think it’s the jurisdictions in which they are operating. So I am just looking to Peter, I don’t believe that…
Peter Toth: I don’t believe too, Tom. 
Tom Palmer : Yes. 
Tanya Jakusconek : Okay. So it’s only other four that you mentioned. Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks. Just one last country to deal with. And then just on the shareholder vote, just to confirm that you need 66 and 2/3 votes of the Newcrest shareholders and 50 point, plus 1 for Newmont? Just want to make sure that I have those right.
Tom Palmer : Tanya, just checking with the team, you break a little bit on this, Tanya. So we are just checking the percentage wise. So it’s 50 plus 1 for Newmont. We believe that is the case. And it’s 2/3 for Newcrest, we believe that’s the case. If that is incorrect, we will circle back and clarify that. 
Tanya Jakusconek : And just wanted, just talk about your coproduct guidance for the year. We were quite low -- sorry we are a bit too high I think on Q1 and so you came in a bit lower. Can you just kind of guide me through and I know Rob did this and I think I missed some of it. But just on the -- overall for Newmont how should I think about the coproducts going through the year? I know we talked about it at Peñasquito that I think we were supposed to have improvement second half weighted for the year. I just want to know 55% weighted for the year. But I just want to know Newmont for a whole, how should I be thinking of the coproduct?
Tom Palmer : Certainly -- starting point in the coproduct will be certainly within guidance. There’s no changes there. Then in terms of the weighting, if I look across the Boddington and Peñasquito is where we have the coproducts Tanya, copper at Boddington, Boddington were in the high grades in the first half, maybe into lower grades, part of mine in the second. So copper production 52 first half, 48 second half copper production out of Boddington.  And then when you look at Peñasquito we are weighted to the second half for silver, lead and zinc. Silver 44-56 first half to second half. Zinc, about 40-60 first half to second half. And lead about 45-55 first half to second half. The geo for the year certainly within the guidance ranges that we provided. 
Tanya Jakusconek : And then if I could just finally ask just maybe your thoughts about the Mexican law or changes thereof and what your thoughts and how you are reading into that please? And thank you. 
Tom Palmer : Yes, thanks, Tanya. Maybe for others on the call that might not be following Mexico as closely. Just in the last week or so the Congress in Mexico approved an amendment to a version an initiative that’s around the forming a legal framework for the mining industry. So it’s got through Congress and in a legislative process that now continues through and to the Senate for further debate discussions. So there's still some uncertainty around the scope of the reform. So it's difficult to speculate on what the impacts might be on the mining industry or specifically on Newmont. So as this is working its way through, we're certainly going through our process of doing our regular reviews of what's been proposed in that initiative and closely monitoring that process, but working also through the Mexican mining chamber, who has taken the lead with this matter on behalf of the mining industry in Mexico. It's an important legal reform. And so we would expect and hope that the Senate promotes some open and constructive dialogue with all parties that are involved. And that's just not the mining companies, that's the communities, the local and municipal governments and the lawmakers responsible for analyzing this initiative. So it's in that stage where we would hope and expect that there is a very active discussion and debate on this reform. There are some -- when you start to review mining frameworks that there is an opportunity to promote greater competition, to promote greater transparency in the sector, to work towards better safety and compliance standards provide more job opportunities and have benefits in terms of social and economic benefits. So I would hope that, that debate is conducted and with the full group of stakeholders involved and looking to improve circumstances in Mexico as a consequence. So early days, a long way to go. Our expectation and our hope is that there is a critical debate that takes place in Mexico.
Tanya Jakusconek : And is your understanding that whatever claims you have in effect would be grandfathered for any changes on tenure, et cetera?
Tom Palmer : That's our understanding, Tanya. As I say, we -- that's our understanding, but we're working through to make sure we fully understand that. It's more about -- it's more about future concessions as opposed to current.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq : Both related to the Canadian operations. Maybe first, Rob, you were talking a little bit about improvements in labor availability. Can you just give some more color as -- is that more or less resolved now? Do you have the right number of people on site across the Canadian operations?
Rob Atkinson : Yes, we do that we're really focused in two areas, very strong recruitment and we've been able to do that very successfully across the three operations. And also just really making sure that our current workforce are turning up for work. So a very strong focus on absenteeism and lead management, and those are both paying off a very significant dividend. So the situation we had last year is vastly different this year. So we're in good shape.
Fahad Tariq : Okay. Good. That's good to hear. And then as a follow-up on the Canadian operations, it sounds like the milling operations, mining operations, lots of productivity improvements year-over-year, but the ASIC remains elevated. Is there something that's part of the equation that maybe we're missing? Is it just higher sustaining CapEx this quarter?
Rob Atkinson : I'll touch on the first issue that you mentioned is that, without a doubt, the performance in Canada has been very, very positive across the board in terms of the development meters and also the material movement, et cetera. So we're very, very pleased with the physical performance. And that also goes into the way in which the plant operates, our recovery, solution losses, et cetera, as well as the underground. So across the Board, we're very pleased with the productivities. But Brian's got some detailed answers in terms of the ASIC.
Brian Tabolt : Yes. Thank you, Rob, and thanks for the question, Fahad. I think as it relates to Musselwhite, I think if you look at our earnings release, our ounces sold were lower and our sustaining capital is a bit higher for the quarter. And that's just largely in line with what we expected for Musselwhite for the period. So that's what drove the higher ASIC.
Operator: You now have Anita Soni from CIBC Capital Markets.
Anita Soni : I guess my first question is with respect broadly to strategy and the acquisition of Newcrest. So you were talking about how your operations are scalable and I was just trying to understand, are we to understand that when you -- if you were to acquire Newcrest, that your intention would be to basically run the 2 million ounces of assets that they have and add that to the 6 or so million ounces and you'd be a, I guess, 7 million-ounce producer or would there be some asset rationalization in there in your going forward plan?
Tom Palmer : Anita, I think the two parts to answer that question. We have an operating model that is scalable to be able to integrate the existing 5 operations at Newcrest with our 12 managed operations and manage those operations safely and effectively. But our focus is on value over volume. We still got a lot of work to do in the context of Newcrest will be inappropriate to comment specifically on Newcrest given it's a live engagement. But we certainly look back at our playbook and our experience with Goldcorp where we divested KCGM, Red Lake, Continental Gold within the first 12 months and brought in the $1.5 billion in proceeds. So as we work through our due diligence on this live transaction and we think about portfolio rationalization, value over volume and synergies, we've got 4 years of experience on muscle memory capability within our team that we draw upon. And we look to that experience to then think about this potential opportunity. So I know I'm being a bit vague because it's a live engagement. But hopefully, you can see the playbook that we have followed over the last 4 years with value over volume being front and center.
Anita Soni : Sure. Okay. Remind me of the divestitures that you did with the Goldcorp transaction. I think there were just two, right? Red Lake and...
Tom Palmer : So as Red Lake, our 50% share in KCGM. And if you recall, we had an interesting Continental Gold in the Buriticá project in Colombia. So we completed those 3 divestments within the first 12 months. That was $1.5 billion. And then we spent the last 4 years cleaning up the noncore equity portfolio, which Triple Flag was the last -- one of the last pieces of that. And that's actually brought in over $700 million of proceeds over the last 4 years.
Anita Soni : Okay. And then I guess my next question would be, I mean, it's been about 4 years since the last major transaction. If this deal were to close, do you think you'd be done for a while? Or would you be looking to do something else, I guess, I thought I'd ask.
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Anita. I probably -- this is a live engagement. We will remain disciplined in terms of decisions we made as to whether it proceeds or not. And we know we have -- we know very, very well if we were successful, that's involved in integrating and delivering synergies. This is -- if this were to come off, it's a transformational transaction. And our focus would be on delivering on our commitments, and we have the experience of knowing what's involved in that. And we will be applying all of that experience for some time to deliver that value.
Anita Soni : Okay. I just want to ask one more question. So the -- not with related to this transaction, but a little bit more on the operations. So I did notice that you mentioned in your ASIC commentary that costs were higher as a result of lower volumes and royalties on higher gold price. So that's the world is a good problem to have. But the comment about lower consumables and inputs, is that -- could we read into that, we're starting to see some input cost pressure is alleviating? Like how should we think about that over the course of the year from a unit cost perspective, not necessarily from the volume perspective?
Rob Atkinson : Sure. Thanks, Anita. The lower consumables, primarily the fact that Tanami was down for 32 days with the weather impacts in the Northern territory. That's the main contributor to that Q1 explanation for consumables in terms of the cost base. As you said, the Q1 unit cost is driven by the 21% weighting in the first quarter. As we look at the end of March and then thinking about the remaining 9 months, the assumptions we made around inflation across our cost base, 50% of our cost base is labor, both employees and contracted services, next 30% is consumables, the next 15% is fuel and energy. The assumptions we have made after the 3 months of the year are holding true. So not seeing any alleviation on our assumptions yet. We're watching that very closely, but not seeing anything that's particularly different from what we've assumed.
Anita Soni : Okay. So you're good for the ending up at [9.20] at the midpoint of the guidance range for the year at this point?
Tom Palmer : Yes. Still on track for landing on that midpoint of our guidance, as you say.
Operator: We now have Greg Barnes from TD Securities.
Greg Barnes : Tom, I just wanted to ask about your views on the safety culture at NGM and what in your perspective, perhaps improvements that could happen there.
Tom Palmer : Good morning, Greg, I'm going to kick off and Rob spends -- Rob will talk to Peter at NGM every couple of weeks. And so we -- there's a very close working relationship and often that is about less around ounces and costs and also around how we can work together on safety, improving safety performance. And there's probably a couple of comments I mean, Greg, is -- it's important. We always have a chronic unease around Sage performance, although we've had a period of time where we've been fatality-free as an organization, I've certainly in my 35 years in mining live through some tragic fatal accidents. And we still have, on average every 10 days, a significant potential event that could a bit vitality. So it's a sensor chronic ones and the things you need to be doing to understand your fatality risks and those critical controls that need to be in place. We don't spend a lot of time on the ground in the operations that we don't manage. So we don't have that in-depth knowledge of what may or may not be happening on the ground at an operation that we don't manage, but we do have a whole bunch of things that we do and we look to share. And I think that's the best thing that we can do, whether it be with NGM as a not joint venture, whether it be with a mining company that we've got no working relationship with, but we're in the same industry. But Robert, maybe give you a flavor of how we think about supporting whether it be NGM or anyone else when it comes to some of the things we try and do when it comes to improving safety performance.
Rob Atkinson : Thanks very much, Tom. And just building on that, Greg, is that we certainly are very, very open to sharing that we've been on a journey, which has had an awful lot of lessons in the past. And those lessons have led to some of the systems that we've developed, and we're very open to sharing those. And we have shared those with our colleagues at NGM. There's certainly very good people at NGM who are working very hard and the tragedies have really shook them to the core, and they're really doing a lot of work in terms of the planning. And when I referred to the discussions that we had, it was about just bouncing off on another what we've done, what's worked for us and what they believe could work there. But they certainly had some challenges, major turnover, et cetera, a lot of new people at Nevada Gold Mines. And they are very committed to changing there. But we have shared our fatality risk management system. We have shared our methodology in terms of the importance of the prestarts, the importance of visible and felt and engage leadership. We have shared our views on very much a caring culture. And those are the things which I'm absolutely sure will be duly considered and taken on board. But the conversations we have performance.
Greg Barnes : And Tom and Rob, perhaps your views on the safety culture at Newcrest, if you have any. I can talk about idea.
Tom Palmer : Yes. Thanks, Greg. We -- it's something that is part of the -- when we think about the confirmatory due diligence, there's all the stuff you do going into data rooms and pouring through resource models and mine plans and the like, an important part of confirmation due diligence is getting on the ground. So whether it be Newcrest or any other potential acquisition we might be looking at, what's very important for us in making our judgment about whether it's a fair value and a transaction we proceed with is getting on the ground with our technical people, but also senior leaders. So as we think about due diligence and site visits, folks like Rob, Aaron Puna, Dean Gehring, all on my team with the Bernard Wessels, Mia Gous, the Francois Hardy, so all very senior operational leaders. As I say, whether it be in the context of a live engagement or any other due diligence we do, having senior leaders on the ground, spending -- you need to spend a day, but you learn a lot walking around an operation within a day in terms of the culture of that operation, in particularly the safety culture. And that is a very important part of our due diligence process and certainly part of a due diligence process that we would be doing in this live engagement. So I can't comment specifically on this particular engagement, but rather that -- it is an important part of our decision-making process, and we send our most senior people to site and safety and safety culture is a fundamental part of that due diligence process.
Operator: We now have Mike Parkin of National Bank.
Mike Parkin : All my questions have been answered. Congrats on the good quarter.
Operator: We have a final question on the line from Anita Soni of CIB Capital -- CIBC World Markets.
Anita Soni : So I just wanted to talk about the issues you talked about in Western Australia. I feel that it was important enough to make your conference call, we should probably delve into that a little bit more. And I do recall meeting the gentleman that you appointed, I can't recall his name, but to head up that initiative. But it's no secret that Newcrest has been at the center of some of these issues. So I'm just trying to understand how ultimately you propose to improve some of their operations, but also deal with the hot roll issues that Newcrest has around sexual harassment and -- in respect of work, they have a program in place called respect at work, which I'm not sure if it's yielded any results yet or not. But I just wanted to see how you guys were thinking about that and would approach that. Obviously, you acknowledged that you've had some issues yourself, but I just want to see how you're thinking about that in the context of a larger company that is now far more focused in Australia.
Tom Palmer : Yes. Thanks, Anita. Really, really important question. And Alex Bates is the name of the person who you're remembering who was the Senior Vice President of our Australian operation and has been working directly for me over the last year, spending time on each of our sites in, as I say, those small focus groups in one-on-one discussions. These are issues that exist in society. So it's every workplace, whether in mining or every else and around the world. And I can say that with confidence now because we're in 8 countries around the world and Alex has completed his engagements at every one of our operations and the consistency and the stories and the personal experiences reflect that these issues exist in every society and certainly in the countries that we work in. So it exists in every workplace, including ours, and I'm confident to say every other mining company as a result. When we think about the work we need to do to change behaviors and improve workplace culture, very deliberately asked Alex to do the work, one, because he has the operational experience. He understands operations and what happens on Saturday nights on back shifts on night shifts and all the rest of it. He also is representative of the group of people whose behaving needs to change in order for us to change the culture and workplace. It's those people with power and privilege. It's people with power and privilege you need to change their behavior. And typically, in our mining industry, certainly in the Western world, it's a lot like Alex, they look a lot like their middle-aged white meat. And so it is about creating dissidence in terms of whose behavior needs to change, how do we change our behavior to create a more respectful workplace. When I think about any potential transaction and integration, whether it be Newcrest or any other company I would -- our approach would be to apply the same things that we're going to have to do within our own operations in terms of setting expectations for what is acceptable behavior to be equipping our leaders with the skills to understand what is inappropriate behavior and address it early on to ensure that we are creating safe work environments many mining operations have accommodation caps. How we're thinking about safe work environments and our accommodation camps, not only for the men and women who work in our mining operations, but importantly, for those people who cater and clean in those accommodation villages. How do we ensure that we have the person at the center of any event that occurs. And we're supporting the person as we work through any particular issue that may present in terms of billing harassment racism and the like. So the actions that we're looking to develop and take at Newmont if we were successful in acquiring Newcrest would be exactly the same actions that we would be applying at a set of Newcrest operations. So nothing specifically that we do. We have a lot of work to do. The industry has a lot of work to do, or frankly, society has a lot of work to do to improve the behavior that's in or places around the world.
Anita Soni : Okay. Well, thank you for that work. There's a woman in mining and one who spent some time in the field. It's definitely important work for sure.
Rob Atkinson : Thanks for the question, Anita. I think, operator, is that it for questions?
Operator: Yes, I can confirm. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for some closing remarks.
Tom Palmer : Thanks, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your time this morning, and please enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks all.
Operator: Thank you all for joining. I can confirm that does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont’s Fourth Quarter Results and 2023 Guidance Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining Newmont’s fourth quarter results and 2023 guidance call. Today, I’m joined by Rob Atkinson and Brian Tabolt, our Interim CFO along with other members of our executive team. And we will all be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. We have quite a bit to cover this morning. So, I wanted to give you an overview of the topics we’ll be sharing. First, I’ll cover the highlights for ‘22 and our strong finish to the year. Then I’ll pass to Brian to take us through the financials. Next, Rob will walk us through our operational results for the fourth quarter and give a preview of what to expect this year from each of our operations and our two key projects. I’ll then summarize our 2023 and longer term outlook, along with our capital allocation strategy, and the expectations for our 2023 dividend. And finally, I’ll wrap up with some comments on our proposed combination with Newcrest. So, with that, let’s get started with our 2022 highlights. Newmont finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, leveraging our scale, our teams and our unmatched portfolio of world class assets to deliver industry-leading ESG, operational and financial results. We are well positioned to continue leading the sector, whilst remaining firmly grounded in our values and driven by our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable responsible mining. At Newmont, when we talk about being a values driven organization, we have at the very core of this work, the protection of the health and safety of our workforce. This simply must be at the heart of any sustainable and responsible mining business. And perhaps the most important thing to share with you today is that we have remained fatality free for over four years. We remain committed to continuously improve our disciplined and dedicated approach to safety, maintaining a clear focus on eliminating the risks that could lead to a fatality. We do this through the globally consistent management of the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent a fatality. Last year, we completed more than 620,000 interactions by our leaders in the field that were focused on these controls, a process that we call Critical Control Verifications. This was an increase of more than 30% over the previous year, demonstrating the importance that we place on visible felt leadership to maintain a safe environment at every one of our 12 managed operations, our major projects and our exploration sites around the world. We also continue to work to improve the effectiveness of our critical control verifications, through increased coaching and development of our frontline leaders. And last year, more than 50 Newmont leaders from across the world participated in field based fatality risk and culture reviews at sites that they do not typically work at. The purpose of these reviews is to identify any systemic issues or improvement opportunities at our managed operations. As a direct consequence of all of this work, in 2022 we experienced a 36% reduction in the number of significant potential events from the previous year. However, health and safety is an area where you must always maintain a sense of chronic unease. We still experience at least one significant potential event every 10 days, and each and every one of these are an opportunity to learn and improve. At Newmont, we recognize that a strong safety culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well run business, it is fundamental to sustainably delivering on our commitments to our employees, our contracted partners, our local communities, and all of our stakeholders. Newmont delivered a strong fourth quarter, safely meeting our commitments in ‘22 and finishing the year in a position of strength with momentum coming into ‘23. We met our original guidance for production set back in December ‘21, producing an industry leading 6 million ounces of gold and 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. We ended the year in line with our guidance ranges for unit costs, as we continued to manage our exposure to the global pressures on input prices and labor costs that have impacted the entire mining industry. These results generated $4.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $3.2 billion in cash from continuing operations, with $1.1 billion in free cash flow after reinvesting $2.7 billion into our business last year. As a key part of that reinvestment, exploration has always been and continues to be a core competency at Newmont. It is a critical component of our long-term strategy. This morning, we announced that our global reserve base now sits at 96 million ounces. And we have successfully replaced depletion for the year. In fact, in the almost four years since we acquired Goldcorp and established the joint venture in Nevada, we have replaced all of our depletion with strong reserve additions. As well as our robust base of gold reserves, we also reported nearly 600 million ounces of silver reserves and 16 billion pounds of copper reserves, providing natural exposure to a metal of growing importance, reducing carbon emissions. Throughout 2022, we maintained a strong, flexible, investment grade balance sheet, whilst continuing to reinvest in our future and providing shareholder returns of more than $1.7 billion through our established dividend framework. These results, along with our stable financial position and strong free cash flow from the world’s largest attributable gold production base has Newmont positioned to safely deliver on our commitments in 2023. And with that, I’ll hand it across to Brian to take us through our financial results for the fourth quarter.
Brian Tabolt : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let’s start with the financial highlights for the quarter. Newmont had a strong finish to the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $3.2 billion in revenue driven by higher sales volumes and strong gold prices, adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.2 billion and an impressive $4.6 billion for the full year, despite historically high and industry wide inflationary pressures, and strong free cash flow of $364 million. It is worth noting that fourth quarter free cash flow included nearly $650 million of capital spend, an increase of more than $200 million from the fourth quarter of last year, as we are now firmly in a period of meaningful reinvestment. This demonstrated commitment to reinvestment is a core component of Newmont’s clear strategy to progress the most profitable projects in our industry-leading organic pipeline, further strengthening Newmont’s portfolio for the long term. Compared to the third quarter, Newmont delivered strong top-line performance with a 16% increase in gold sales driven off the back of a strong fourth quarter production and an improved realized gold price of $1,758 per ounce. However, fourth quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million or $1.87 per share, driven by approximately $2 billion of non-cash accounting adjustments. These adjustments which are further detailed in our earnings release and 10-K include $700 million of non cash reclamation adjustments, primarily related to higher estimated closure costs at Yanacocha and Porcupine resulting from cost inflation, and increased water management costs at operating portions of the sites and $1.3 billion of non-cash impairments which were comprised of approximately $500 million of asset impairments at CC&V and $800 million of goodwill impairments that Cerro Negro and Porcupine. The site specific goodwill announced originated from the Goldcorp purchase price allocation four years ago, which was based on best estimates of each site’s value and country risk assumptions at that time. It should be noted that incrementally more value has been generated at Peñasquito that was originally allocated at the time, as Peñasquito alone has since delivered more than $700 million in annual synergies, far exceeding the value of these non-cash charges. Taking these adjustments into account along with other immaterial items, we reported the fourth quarter adjusted net income $348 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, which, despite slightly higher costs from inventory write-downs and royalties, represents an increase of $0.17 from the previous quarter. Delivered by our balanced global portfolio, these strong results demonstrate Newmont’s continued financial strength and stability, enabling us to be flexible and resilient as we continue to generate long-term value for our shareholders, heading into 2023. Now, I’ll hand it over to Rob for an update on our operational results for the fourth quarter and a preview of 2023.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, our team safely delivered an exceptional finish to the year, and we’re very proud of what our 30,000 strong Newmont team was able to achieve during 2022, despite the very-challenging and volatile operating environment that the whole mining industry was navigating. Today, I’ll cover the site level highlights for the fourth quarter, along with an overview of what to expect in 2023 from each of our operations and our two key development projects. So turning to the next slide, let’s get started with Peñasquito. When we acquired Goldcorp in 2019, we committed to delivering synergies of $365 million per year by applying the Newmont operating model to deliver value from G&A, supply chain, and most importantly, the implementation of our proven Full Potential continuous improvement program. Peñasquito alone has blown that target out of the water, delivering more than $700 million in annual synergies since we closed the acquisition nearly four years ago. Our core capability at Newmont is safely operating Tier 1 open pit and underground mines, and over 80% of this value is delivered from mining and processing improvements. And we have not stopped yet. Peñasquito delivered a strong fourth quarter, setting a new record in December for the tons we moved ex pit and exceeding our full year production guidance for the third consecutive year under the Newmont operating model. During the fourth quarter, mining was primarily from the Chile Colorado pit as planned, resulting in lower gold grades and higher levels of silver, lead and zinc contents. And as we progress this year, we expect this mining sequence and trend to continue at our two-pit polymetallic mine as previously communicated and in line with our long-term mine plans. In the first quarter, we expect gold grade to decline more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter due to this mine sequence. And for the year we expect gold production to be around 25% lower than 2022, whilst our gold equivalent ounces will be steady year-on-year. In South America, Yanacocha delivered slightly higher production during the fourth quarter compared to quarter three. With higher production expected in 2023 from higher leach recoveries due to the continued use of injection leaching, we continue to progress our review of the scope and the pace of the Sulfides project and expect to spend approximately $300 million to $350 million of development capital in 2023 and again in 2024. This spend is related to advanced engineering, procurement and completing camp construction. At Merian, the site delivered its highest quarterly production in two years due to record mill performance combined with higher grades mined from both the Maraba and Merian II pits. Merian is expected to deliver lower production and higher unit costs in 2023 as we begin stripping the next phase of the Merian pit, resulting in lower grades presenting to the mill as part of our planned mine sequence for the site. In particular, in the first quarter, we expect grades to decline more than 15% compared to quarter four as we enter the stripping campaign. And finally, at Cerro Negro, the site delivered another solid quarter due to higher grade and strong mill performance. Production from Cerro Negro is expected to steadily increase each quarter in 2023 due to sustained productivity improvements from our Newmont operating model. This will result in progressively higher tons mined and processed throughout the year. We continue to progress the first wave of district expansions at Cerro Negro, which will contribute to the higher production this year. And we just hit an important milestone with the first blast to commence development at the Silica Cap portal. In December, this project received approval for $200 million that will be spent over the next two years to develop Cerro Negro’s future through both the Marianas and Eastern Districts. And these funds will primarily be spent on underground development activities. This investment will extend mine life beyond 2030, and we expect to see annual production increase to above 350, 000 ounces beginning in 2024. Since we acquired Cerro Negro nearly four years ago, we’ve improved underground development rates by more than 50% and doubled the size of our land package to over 1,000 square kilometers, demonstrating both our operating capability and our confidence in the untapped growth potential from this highly prospective gold district in Argentina. In North America, our Canadian operations all delivered higher production in quarter four, a combined increase of 30,000 ounces compared to quarter three due to strong grades and improved productivity. At Éléonore, we finished 2022 with the strongest quarterly performance of the year. And importantly, key roles are all filled, and the team is ready to deliver higher ounces in 2023. This increase is largely driven by sustained productivity improvements as higher underground mining rates and strong mill performance will offset the lower grades coming through. At Musselwhite, we delivered our best quarterly performance in terms of gold production, development meters and total tons mined in more than five years. We anticipate production in 2023 to be weighted around 65% to the second half of the year, steadily increasing each quarter as mining continues in the PQ Deeps area. Porcupine delivered its strongest quarterly performance of the year and annual production is expected to slightly improve in 2023 due to higher tons mined and higher grade. We continue to progress the project to replace production from the Hollinger pit production with a layback of the Pamour pit. An investment decision is now expected in late ‘23 as we’ve been able to implement improvements to extend the life of the Hollinger pit. And at CC&V, we achieved our highest December production in over three years, resulting in a solid fourth quarter from higher tons mined and placed on our leach pads. Production in 2023 is expected to decrease slightly due to lower grades as we extend mine life through the stripping of a layback in the Globe Hill pit. In 2023, our four North American operations are expected to deliver nearly 1 million ounces of gold. This increase over 2022 will be safely delivered by a strong leadership team of experienced general managers who are in place, a stable workforce and without the challenges and constraints from COVID that we had to navigate through during the first half of last year. Boddington delivered an exceptionally strong quarter with 20% higher gold production and more than 50% higher copper production compared to quarter three. We set two important records in the fourth quarter, a new all-time monthly production record in December for both gold and copper on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance, and the best quarterly performance for our autonomous haul truck fleet for the tons moved per hour, a key metric for every open pit mine. Reaching these important milestones at a cornerstone operation like Boddington is a tremendous achievement, and we are proud of the hard work and dedication that our team has demonstrated in implementing leading technologies to promote both safety and productivity. The lessons we have learned will benefit not only Newmont but the gold industry as a whole, and we will look to leverage this technology and our experience at Boddington as we expand the use of autonomous solutions across our global business. In 2023, gold production is expected to remain steady compared to 2022, as continued strong mill performance and tons mined offset lower grade associated with further stripping in Boddington South pit. Tanami maintained strong production throughout the year and reliably delivered a solid fourth quarter from higher tons mined combined with higher grades despite an extreme weather event and record rainfall across Northwest Australia late in the quarter. Gold production is expected to be lower in 2023 and 2024 due to lower grades from the planned stope sequencing to allow for the underground construction of the crushing and conveying infrastructure associated with the Tanami Expansion project. Due to the extreme weather events and associated flooding, the main access route for supplies to Tanami and Tanami track has been closed from late December through mid-February. And although our fourth quarter was largely unaffected by this event, critical consumables such as cyanide, explosives and other reagents that can only come to site by road have not been able to be delivered over the last 6 to 8 weeks, and we have consumed the stocks that we maintained on site. As a consequence, we had to cease milling operations at Tanami over the last few weeks, and this will have an impact on gold production for the first quarter. However, the bottleneck at Tanami is the mining operation, not the milling plant, and mining has continued throughout this period with the ore being stockpiled in front of the mill. We restart the mill tomorrow and expect to recover the ounces that will be delayed from Q1, but that now means that we will have a production profile this year that will be strongly weighted to the second half. And with this impact, we expect only around 10% of Tanami’s 2023 gold production to be delivered during the first quarter. We also continue to progress the expansion at Tanami. Overall progress is now at 50% with engineering and procurement effectively complete, protecting the project from any new inflationary or supply chain challenges in the coming years. 373 meters of concrete lining has now been installed in the upper part of the 1,500 meter deep shaft, and this furnishing of the shaft continues to be the critical path work for the project. Underground development for the project has largely been completed with crusher and conveyor chambers, all fully excavated and ready for construction of infrastructure to commence. And as I signaled last July, following the completion of the four important project milestones of shaft reaming, head frame construction, underground development and the opening of state and international borders in Australia, we would assess project capital cost and schedule. We are expecting total capital costs of between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion and the project completion in the second half of 2025. This is consistent with the direction we provided last July. Tanami Expansion 2 remains a key project in Newmont’s portfolio and underpins Tanami’s future as a long-life, low-cost producer well into the 2040. Turning to Africa. Our two operations in Ghana delivered this year’s strongest quarterly performance in Q4, increasing production by more than 45,000 ounces compared to Q3. In December, Akyem delivered its strongest monthly production in seven years on the back of higher tons mined, higher grades and strong mill performance. In 2023, Akyem is expected to deliver lower production as we progress stripping of the next layback in the pit. And as a consequence, 2023 gold production will be around 20% lower than last year as a result of lower grades. Ore grade is expected to decline by more than 40% in Q1 compared to Q4. Moving across Ahafo, the mill achieved record throughput during the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher grade and mining rates as Subika underground really starts to hit its stride. In 2023, gold production from Ahafo is expected to steadily increase each quarter as we open up more draw points in the Subika underground, lifting mining rates and resulting in the delivery of more higher grade ore to the mill over the course of the year. As a consequence, gold production will be strongly weighted to the second half of the year with around 15% of the year’s production to be delivered in the first quarter. And I’m pleased to announce that we are making great progress with our new mine in Ghana, Ahafo North, where we gained land access and have commenced construction and highway relocation activities. Ahafo North expands our existing footprint in the Ahafo complex, adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. And when combined with Ahafo South just 30 kilometers away, we expect to deliver an average of 850,000 -- I beg your pardon. 350,000 -- sorry. We expect to deliver an average of 850,000 gold ounces per year through until at least 2030 from our Ahafo complex. Leaning into one of Newmont’s core capabilities, we have conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements to ensure that from the very start of this project, we earn and maintain social acceptance. The process of engagement is critical work that cannot and must not be rushed. There’s an African proverb that we consistently apply at Newmont. “If you want to go fast, you go alone. If you want to go far, we go together.” And as I signaled last July, gaining land access and commencing construction activities was a key milestone for us to reach in order to assess project capital cost and schedule. We are expecting total capital costs of between $950 million and $1.05 billion in project completion in the second half of 2025. This is consistent with the direction we provided last July. We remain very excited about Ahafo North and look forward to bringing you updates as we develop this new mine over the next two years and create value from the best unmined gold deposit in West Africa. Finally, to our two non-managed joint ventures. Our 38.5% ownership of Nevada Gold Mines and 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 1.45 million ounces of attributable gold production in 2022. For Nevada Gold Mines, disappointingly, fourth quarter and full year production fell below the lower end of the guidance range and above the higher end for costs that were provided by Barrick in November 2022. However, most concerning was that these two non-managed joint ventures have experienced three tragic fatalities over the last 12 months. As for the 2023 guidance provided last week by Barrick, gold production is expected to increase by around 10% from both Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo in 2023. Both of these joint ventures are core to the Newmont portfolio, and we look forward to our managing partners safely delivering on their 2023 commitment. And with that, I’ll hand it back to Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Rob. So bringing everything that Rob just covered together, we finished ‘22 strongly, and we are bringing that momentum into this year. As we’ve been signaling for some time, in 2023, we are expecting to produce around 6 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of around $1,200 an ounce. Sustaining capital lifts to around $1.1 billion. Exploration and advanced project spend will be around $500 million. And we will see our highest development capital spend in a generation at around $1.3 billion. At Newmont, we developed our business plans with discipline around the assumptions we make. In 2023, we anticipate that the current economic environment will continue to be volatile, and with this context believe that it is particularly important to understand the sensitivity of our free cash flow and all-in sustaining costs to the key assumptions we have made. We have taken a conservative view of gold price for 2023 and are assuming $1,700 an ounce. This table provides our sensitivities to other metal prices, oil as well as the Australian and Canadian exchange rates. For ‘23, we have assumed normalizing levels of inflation as we progress through the year with an assumption that the year-over-year escalation rate will be around 3%. And as we do each year, we expect that this escalation will be offset by our ongoing discipline in delivering on full potential improvements. This year, we are also including a guide on the sensitivity to our three main cost areas. 50% of our direct costs are labor, an area under continued pressure in our mining industry. We have assumed our labor costs will increase 4.5% compared to last year before returning to more historical levels, and we are keeping a close eye on contract labor, which tends to be much more volatile. Materials and consumables account for the next 30%. We are seeing input prices for cyanide and explosives beginning to normalize with improvements in global supply chain performance. In addition, the price of the steel we use for grinding media and spare parts is now in line with last year’s average prices. These two categories, along with fuel and energy, remain highly volatile and impacted by the many macroeconomic events the world is experiencing. High levels of inflation have a material impact on our unit costs, and we will continue to remain transparent with the market as we monitor the inflationary environment over the coming months. Turning now to seasonality on the next slide. We anticipate that gold production this year will be weighted 55% to the second half, driven by Ahafo, Tanami, Peñasquito and Cerro Negro, as Rob just explained. Q1 is expected to be our lowest gold production quarter with approximately 21% of annual production. However, we expect to have relatively steady spending for both, our sustaining and development capital throughout the year. We anticipate that production will increase and unit costs will decline each quarter as the year progresses. Turning to our five-year outlook on the next slide. Supported by the industry’s most robust, balanced and diverse portfolio of operations and projects, we expect to deliver strong gold production and improving unit costs over the next five years, bringing our all-in sustaining cost to around $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce by 2025. This cost improvement will be driven by strong production from our world-class assets, Boddington, Tanami, Ahafo and Peñasquito, combined with the delivery of new low-cost ounces from our investments in Ahafo North, Tanami Expansion 2 and the district expansions at Cerro Negro. Our near-term cost reductions are also supported by the delivery of full potential cost and productivity improvements across our 12 managed operations. This solid outlook, combined with the strength of our team and the quality of our assets, has the ability to generate substantial, attributable cash flows throughout the gold price cycle, allowing us to confidently execute on our capital allocation priorities and maintain our position as the world’s leading gold company. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear and balanced strategy, first and foremost, to maintain the industry’s strongest balance sheet with financial strength and flexibility; second, to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth; and finally, to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends. I’ll take a moment to step through each of these priorities, explaining their significance to Newmont and how they work together in order for us to deliver a long-term stable outlook. Starting with our first priority. Newmont has maintained an investment-grade balance sheet with financial strength and flexibility to ensure we have the right balance between resilience, returns and the ability to react. We have made deliberate efforts over the last few years to build the industry’s strongest balance sheet, growing our cash balances to $3.7 billion with total liquidity of $6.7 billion and no debt due until 2029. This robust platform has allowed Newmont to enter the current phase of the commodity cycle in a uniquely strong financial position, enabling us to be resilient and agile in times of market instability. Our second priority is to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth, ensuring that our current and future reserve and resource position can continue to support our industry-leading portfolio of operations and projects. Our long-term outlook assumes annual investment of around $1 billion to $1.2 billion in sustaining capital, around $400 million to $500 million in exploration and studies, and around $800 million to $1 billion in development capital. Combined, this is an average annual investment of around $2.5 billion, a critical component in Newmont strategy to sustain strong production levels and improve margins over the long-term. [Technical Difficulty] we are currently [Technical Difficulty] Due to the higher capital spend anticipated this year, Newmont expects to reinvest approximately $2.9 billion in 2023, which is around $400 million higher than our average annual investment. And it’s also important to note that these numbers exclude our equity method contributions to support the Pueblo Viejo expansion. [Technical Difficulty] to maintain our [Technical Difficulty] profile for the next 10, 20, 30 years. Our portfolio of operations and organic project pipeline will produce more than [Technical Difficulty] of attributable gold each year, through [Technical Difficulty] in our industry. This profile [Technical Difficulty] production of approximately 1 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Importantly, the majority of this metal production comes from the most favorable mining jurisdictions, balanced across 12 managed operations two non-managed joint ventures in nine countries around the world. And it is this strength and scale that enables Newmont to confidently execute on a clear and consistent long-term strategy to deliver value to our workforce, our local communities and to our shareholders. Then our final capital allocation priority is to return excess cash to shareholders, which is primarily done through our industry-leading dividend framework. Recognizing the importance of shareholder returns, 2.5 years ago, Newmont was the first in the gold industry to introduce a structured dividend framework. This framework provides shareholders with a stable base dividend of $1 per share, centered at gold reserve price of $1,400 per ounce and a variable component based on incremental free cash flow above that base assumption. As we do each year, we have evaluated the 2023 dividend payout in conjunction with our annual business planning process. The expected range for dividends to be paid this year is $1.40 to $1.80 per share, and this range has been calibrated at a conservative $1,700 gold price. Anticipated incremental free cash flow in 2023 has been adjusted to incorporate the current input costs being experienced across the mining industry from unprecedented levels of global inflation, the $400 million of higher capital spend above our long-term average, and considering the strength of our balance sheet during this period of meaningful reinvestment. Taking all of these considerations into account, and in line with what we have been discussing since our last earnings call in October, this morning, we declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis. This continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector and within the top 80% of large cap dividend payers in the S&P 500. With this dividend declared, Newmont will have returned over $4 billion to shareholders through dividends since introducing our framework in October 2020, maintaining a dividend yield above 3% for nine consecutive quarters. Our proven track record of returning cash to shareholders clearly demonstrates our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and the balanced long-term approach that we apply to our capital allocation strategy, ensuring that Newmont is well positioned to create value for many decades to come. So, I’ve just taken you through the gold industry’s strongest business. Now from that solid foundation, let me walk you through the value proposition for our potential combination with Newcrest. Before I begin, please understand that other than these prepared remarks, I’m not able to provide any further details about the Newcrest proposal at this time as this is a live engagement. Our proposal would combine two of the sector’s top senior gold producers and set the standard for sustainable and responsible gold mining. Newmont has a long history and shared heritage with Newcrest, establishing our Australian subsidiary way back in 1966, a subsidiary that would become Newcrest some 25 years later. As part of that shared history, our companies also have shared commitments to a strong safety culture and leading ESG practices, which is in addition to the complementary portfolios of world-class assets located in low-risk mining jurisdictions. Our proposed combination would strengthen our established position in Australia, creating efficiencies and value with a shared workforce and large-scale supply chain optimization opportunities. And it would build upon the district potential in British Columbia’s highly prospective golden triangle through a combination of operating mines and development projects that would deliver value through shared technology, local capabilities and orebody experience. With our scale and track record of successfully managing some of the mining world’s top Tier 1 assets, this combination would leverage Newmont’s experience from the Goldcorp acquisition, which demonstrated that we can generate meaningful improvements to performance, stability and profitability, especially at large open pit and underground operations. We have delivered more than $1 billion in annual synergies from our Goldcorp acquisition in 2019, far surpassing our initial estimate of $365 million and improving the ongoing performance of the acquired assets through Newmont’s operating model. At Peñasquito alone, we have generated over $700 million of annual synergies by optimizing the processing plant and mining fleet while sustainably addressing community relations issues that have disrupted that site for over a decade. And as a reminder, upon completion of the Goldcorp acquisition, we focused on optimizing the combined portfolio, completing asset sales of more than $1.5 billion from that combined portfolio within the first 12 months. And given the challenges that the mining industry is currently facing from a volatile macroeconomic environment, there has never been a better time for Newmont and Newcrest to come together. We are disappointed that the Newcrest Board rejected our proposal, and we are currently engaging with the Newcrest team in relation to their offer to provide us access to more information. And if we can reach an agreement, this combination of industry-leading talent and decades of collective experience would create significant value across the global business with an ideal mix of gold and copper, strengthening Newmont’s overall position as the world’s leading gold company. As I indicated, I will not be able to make -- provide any further details on the Newcrest proposal at this time as this is a live engagement. But I want to be clear with everyone on today’s call that we will continue to be disciplined as we assess all of the options to move forward, and we will act in the best interest of our shareholders. Thank you. And with that, I’ll now turn it over to the operator to open the lines up for questions.
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs.
Emily Chieng: My first question is just around the two expansion projects that you have going on, Tanami 2 and Ahafo North. I know you’re targeting first gold by the second half of 2025. But can you talk through what perhaps are the key constraints that you may face in achieving that timeline? Is it labor? Is it supply chain? I guess how much buffer is being built into that construction period there?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Emily, and good morning. Both those projects have hit, as Rob was describing, important milestones that allow us to assess both schedule and cost to complete. So for us, at Ahafo North, it was achieving land access, which we have achieved. So, that means we can now essentially pin our ears back and build a mine that we’ve built 3 times before. It’s the same mine is Ahafo. It’s the same mine as Akyem. It’s the same mine as Merian, and our EPCM contractor is like a podium who have been our key partner in Ghana for over 20 years. So, we know how to build Ahafo North very well. We’ve hit the key milestone in terms of land access. Our communication towers are going up, lands being cleared. We’ve got CAT gear on hard stands, temporary fuel facilities in place. And the schedule and the cost we provide, we are highly confident in delivering because we’ve hit that critical milestone. For Tanami 2, the critical milestone for us was completing the reaming of the shaft, completing the development underground. So, some massive chambers underground that our mining team has very successfully completed and safely completed. The installation of the head frame above that shaft and the mobilization of the key team, a very specialized team that will spend the next two years in a Galloway, heading down that shaft, forming concrete and then installing pipes, infrastructure and then a separate team that will get underground to install conveyors and crushers. So with that key milestone, we have confidence in both the schedule and the cost to run that project to complete. Engineering is done. Procurement is done. We’re 50% complete. So those -- we are at two important milestones, which is why we held back to now before we provided the update. So Emily, you should have a high degree of confidence in the Newmont team to deliver those projects within schedule and cost.
Emily Chieng: Great. That’s very helpful. And just a follow-up around the cost outlook for the next couple of years there. I know you’ve mentioned we should expect to see costs come down by 2026 on some increased production. But, as we think about the 2024 and 2025 outlook, is the step down there from ‘23 through ‘26 also attributable to some production increases, or is there any sort of baked in expectation for the labor and consumable costs also coming down in that period as well?
Tom Palmer: We’re certainly expecting costs and inflation levels for this year to be the same as ‘22. We do assume a little bit of easing in ‘24, ‘25, ‘265. So that is partly a driver. In ‘24, there’s also the work we’re doing on productivity improvement and the additional ounces that you see coming through in that production profile. I think a big mine there is -- that contributes to that is Peñasquito. It’s a polymetallic mine. The gold equivalent ounces stay pretty stable. But depending on which pit we’re in, the gold ounces change quite significantly year-on-year, as you’re seeing ‘22 to ‘23. So, if you have a year of high gold ounces, that obviously helps your all-in sustaining costs for gold. So, there’s some easing of inflation in ‘24, productivity improvements in ‘24, some more ounces from lower-cost operations coming through. ‘25, ‘26, ‘27 is really driven by the low cost ounces coming in from the investments we’re making, Cerro Negro, Tanami, Ahafo North and from our non-managed joint ventures. We’ll see some low cost ounces coming through from the Pueblo Viejo expansion. So, there’s a number of factors there.
Operator: The next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski with BMO Capital Markets.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks very much, and congratulations on the quarter. The first question I want to ask is regarding a press release you came out with a little while ago. I’m sorry, I’m going to mess this up. But you announced that Natascha Viljoen, I think it is, is going to be joining you at some point, maybe in about a year or so as your COO. Can you talk a little bit about what she’s going to bring to Newmont? And maybe what Rob Atkinson is going to be doing in his new role? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Jackie. And it’s Natascha Viljoen, and maybe the operator feels better try to pronounce his name. We’re part of a well-governed company. I think part of a hallmark of Newmont for many, many years is the work we do to ensure that we continue to develop our internal talent. We continue to strengthen our team by looking for opportunities to bring in external talent. And as I do the work with our Board and with my executive team, we’re constantly challenging ourselves to where can we continue to strengthen what is already a strong team, ensure that we are positioned to address the -- both the risks and opportunities out in front of us. So over the course of these last 12 months, we have strengthened our general manager team. Across our 12 managed operations, we have the strongest set of general managers in my decade with Newmont. And there’s a mixture there of internal promotions and bringing in some external talent. We have strengthened our -- our 4 -- 5 Senior Vice President team. So David Fry coming in to run our projects, one of the best in the industry for project delivery and a future leader of Newmont joined us last year. Four Senior Vice Presidents have come in, all internal appointments and promotions within our organization. And I would argue, we have our strongest operational team in my 10 years at Newmont. We’ve brought in Aaron Puna joining us from Anglo American, who was running Anglo’s copper business in Chile, strengthening the leadership of our technical team, to be able to take us to our next chapter in Newmont’s journey. And Natascha’s appointment is a continuation of looking to continue to build on what is already a strong team. The nature of these sorts of appointments is very long term. You’re looking to understand how you strengthen this business over the long term. So, as you saw in the announcement, Natascha could be up to 12 months before she joins us. And there will be a very orderly transition at that time with Rob. And then Rob, after more than four years in the COO role, will then turn his mind to working with me on the next opportunities that we have within our portfolio. So, this is about looking at where we want to place our organization strategically, ensuring we’re looking to continually build a strong team and ensuring that we’ve got a well-governed stable team for the long term.
Jackie Przybylowski: And if I could ask a second question. Your dividend sits at around $1,700 gold price. I know you’ve noted that it looks fairly conservative today, although these things are obviously very volatile. Can you talk a little bit about how you plan to either smooth that dividend, or if there’s any upside if full price stays over around current levels through the year. Could we see that dividend range that you mentioned earlier maybe go up or be exceeded by year-end?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Jackie. I think we’ve -- we take a conservative view to gold price, as I said, and setting it at $1,700. We are in a volatile world. There’s a lot of experience that we bring in to our consideration of ‘23 based upon how ‘22 played out and even a couple of years before that. So, there are certainly lots of upside risk on gold price as you look into 2023. Equally, there are a lot of factors that present downside risk to gold price as we look into 2023. You only have to go back to late October to see the gold price was sitting down at $16.50. We’re enjoying it sitting above $1,800 at the moment. But when we sit here in February, we maintained a fairly sober view as to how 2023 might play out, both in terms of gold price and in terms of inflation. And we’re ensuring that we are positioning Newmont to be strong and resilient through what I anticipate will be a volatile year. We’ve set up our range at $1,700 gold price at $1.40 to $1.80. And the dividend we declared this morning is set at $1.60. So that gives us some opportunity within that range to assess how the year plays out, and I’m confident that every quarter, we’ll have some good robust debates with our Board around what the appropriate debt payout is. But we certainly built a range that allows for some potential upside in gold price to play out through the year. But we’d want to see that play out rather than attempt to predict what gold may do or inflation may do in a, what I anticipate to be a very volatile year.
Jackie Przybylowski: Am I allowed to sneak in one more question?
Tom Palmer: Go for it, Jackie.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thank you. So, we had dinner together in December in New York, and you talked about growth and meaningful growth at that point and talking about how that would help your relevance or maybe introduce you to some new shareholders or new funds on the generalist side. And so, this Newcrest proposal seems like it’s very consistent with that. If for whatever reason the combination of Newmont and Newcrest doesn’t end up working out, do you look to another growth vehicle, another M&A transaction to achieve that growth, or what would be your -- what would be your response to your plan going forward if this transaction does not happen?
Tom Palmer: Thank you, Jackie. Let me attempt to answer this question by staying away from the comments I made. As we spent most of the call covering, we have the best gold business in the industry by a long shot. We are very comfortable with the foundation that we have, and we will continue to act with discipline, both in assessing any opportunities and ensuring that we’re running -- safely running our business to deliver on our commitments. As part of your first question, when we think about how we continue to strengthen a strong team, we do think about our strategy. We have -- Peter Toth’s been with us now for 6 or 9 months, supporting me and the Board and my executive team and thinking about our strategy. And as part of that work, we have a very clear eyed understanding of our capabilities as an organization today in 2023. I think we’re an ESG leader. And we believe that we run very large open pit and underground mines very well. We understand our capabilities. We then look at what are the megatrends impacting the world, and our company, and those mega trends are coming from society and investors, they’re coming from technology, and they’re coming from geopolitical events around the world as we’re seeing playing out. So, we understand and assess those megatrends and determine what set of capabilities and what sort of organization we need to be 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now. And we can do that because we transformed our business back in 2019 with the acquisition of Goldcorp and the establishment of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture. From that knowledge and that understanding, we then look to what it means to continue to be the responsible gold leader. We then look for what it means in terms of our gold industry that’s subject to those same megatrends that has to consolidate. And then, we look to what it means in terms of diversification, particularly as you think about copper. And we have, as I said in my opening remarks, 16 billion pounds of copper in our organic project pipeline. If we do nothing else, we are diversifying in the copper as we shepherd that project pipeline through. So Jackie, that’s the lens with which we look at our organization. That’s the lens with which we look to try and bring in talent to ensure we’ve got a team that can lead this organization for the next 10, 15, 20 years. And that’s how we assess our business today, and that’s how we assess any external opportunities that may present.
Operator: The next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity.
Carey MacRury: Just in your comments on capital allocation, you didn’t mention share buybacks. So I’m just wondering is that something you still consider as an option, or is the focus really on the dividend going forward.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Carey, and good morning. Our primary vehicle for returns to shareholders has always been, since we introduced that dividend framework back in October 2020, to return cash through dividends. That’s a primary vehicle. We don’t have an approved buyback program at the moment. If you look back at the majority of the share buybacks that we have done over the last two or three years, it’s been linked to asset sales. So, when we sold KCGM, Red Lake and our share in Continental and the Buriticá project in Colombia, those proceeds were primarily the vehicles that we used for share buybacks. And that’s typically what we do, otherwise, dividends is our primary vehicle.
Carey MacRury: Got it. And then, without trying to ask about Newcrest, just wondering if you can just share more broadly how you think about Papua New Guinea. I know you were in Indonesia quite a few years back. Just any thoughts on Papua New Guinea as a mining jurisdiction?
Tom Palmer: Again, Carey, I’ll avoid the direct question, but maybe answer more broadly. When we think about a balanced, diverse portfolio, think about our capabilities, we have demonstrated. If I look at Peñasquito in Mexico, look at what Newmont have done going into Peñasquito in that first year in 2019 to be able to work with government communities to address a decade-long issue and then deliver sensational performance out of that operation, beating guidance in three consecutive years since we’ve had that operation. We have a core capability that’s running very large open pit and underground mines. We also have a core capability around social responsibility and being able to engage with communities. And in a balanced portfolio that has as a foundation top-tier jurisdictions, we can afford to balance some other jurisdictions that wouldn’t fit the top-tier category. We, today -- our portfolio today has us in Ghana, has us in Suriname. We’re down in Argentina. We’re in Peru. We’re exploring in French Guiana. So for us, it’s about understanding your core capabilities, understand the foundation of your business and then ensure you’ve got a balanced diverse portfolio that allows you to take some managed risk.
Operator: The next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC World Markets.
Anita Soni: I had a lot to ask about the deal, but I guess I won’t be able to, particularly since I cover Newcrest. But, let me focus in on the dividend and ask, given the seasonality that you have that you mentioned this year about the development CapEx and sustaining capital are relatively flat, could we see that dividend sort of change over the course of the year quarter-to-quarter, like maybe hitting the bottom end at the $1.40 and then perhaps the top -- closer to the higher end at $1.80 as you progress through the year? Or would you be more inclined to smooth it out? And I guess I’m just trying to understand how you would -- what gets you to the $1.40, what gets you to the $1.80?
Tom Palmer: Thanks. Good morning, Anita. And apologies, I can’t cover your questions you want to cover. Maybe one day. The dividend is -- our dividend is about being stable and predictable over long term, and it is about using the strong balance sheet and the cash that we’ve generated from higher gold prices over time that now sits at our strong balance sheet. So, as we have those discussions and debates around the free cash flow that you might generate there in any given quarter or the level of investment in any given quarter, we don’t look to have our dividend whipsaw quarter-to-quarter. We look to give our shareholders some ability of confidence sand stability in our dividend as we move forward and not have it jumping up and down quarter-to-quarter, so. And we’ll use -- we will use our balance sheet to support that stability and predictability.
Anita Soni: Okay. So then, I guess, the second part of that question was basically then like in what instance would you be inclined to use the $1.40 rather than the $1.80?
Tom Palmer: So thanks, Anita. If you think about the world we’re living in and the volatility around gold price and inflation. As best we look at this year, conservatively, we think our unit cost is going to be $1,200 and $1,700 gold price. And we have picked the dividend for the first quarter at $0.40 or $1.60. Now I preface this by saying our Board have the authority to approve every quarter. So, I would then point to those key assumptions, point to our sensitivities that we’ve provided. And so there is a circumstance here where the world could jump to $1,600, costs can go to $1,300. That would be a circumstance where we would then look at do we need to think about the lower end of our range? Equally, there’s circumstances where costs could be a little bit better than $1,200, and gold could sit stubbornly above $1,800. That would give cause for us to have a discussion with our Board around what we might do over the course of this year. And we’re making decisions around that range for the 2023 year. We’ll come back and revisit it for 2024 much later in this year.
Anita Soni: So, the $0.40 you declared for Q4 is probably a good guide post borrowings, borrowing changes, right, to what we’re looking at. Is that fair to say?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I think we’ve put a marker out there for you in terms of as we sit here in mid-February, $400 gold, $1,700-- $1,200 unit costs, $1,700 gold price, $0.40 per share dividend is a good marker for you.
Anita Soni: I’m going to ask this question. It relates to the deal, but -- or the bid on the table or the indication. But how -- I mean, how does the dividend change and evolve given that Newcrest, and I happen to cover Newcrest, is a negative free cash flow more -- vary dramatically. The best way -- they’re in a very heavy capital reinvestment cycle. And how does that impact your -- how stable is the dividend post this year if this -- given the offers that are on the table right now?
Tom Palmer: Nice try, Anita. I’m sorry. But let me maybe come back and answer. I’ll try to answer your question. We spent a lot of time talking about our capital allocation hierarchy. And the tension between balance sheet strength, reinvesting in our business at the right level of spend, and that’s -- the cash you’re going to afford to do, but also your ability for execution and ensure that you can have a successful project. And we understand the importance of industry-leading returns to shareholders. So, for us, in whatever scenario we’re in, it’s that triangle of tension between balance sheet strength, reinvestment, leading shareholder returns. And that doesn’t change. That’s part of what Newmont is.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then one last one, in terms of the capital outlook, you’ve noted that it doesn’t include Yanacocha Sulfides in the out years. Just trying to get an understanding. The development capital, we have a conversation every year. But development capital, I mean, when you look at the development capital in 2026 and 2027, it’s probably going to come up to the level of 2025 and 2024. You mentioned 2023 is a little higher than normal, but it probably should come up like we should be using the 2024, 2025 levels as the out years as well.
Tom Palmer: Yes. I’ll just clarify that for you. What we’re trying to -- be very, very disciplined with what the guidance we provide on development capital, but I’d point you to that long run average. $800 million to $1 billion is what I’d encourage you to use if you’re modeling out into the future. And this year and next year, some of the biggest reinvestment we’ve done since we’ve built that back in the early 2000s. So this is an extraordinary period of reinvestment. The long-term average is much more like it.
Operator: Next question comes from Cleve Rueckert with UBS.
Cleve Rueckert: Tom, well done on managing all the information, I feel like we could spend the next year discussing the slides and everything that’s been presented. So, I have just a couple of follow-ups. Previously, just on the guidance, you had provided kind of two sets of guidance, one at your base case kind of explaining the assumptions behind that, and then another one with mostly different cost assumptions at kind of the spot scenario. And then, that framework was obviously incorporated into the dividend and cascaded down the line. Is the costs -- I mean, the cost structure that you’ve presented today, is that the base case, or is sort of that base $1 dividend at $1,400 an ounce gold, assuming slightly lower cost basis?
Tom Palmer: Certainly, we’ve tried to simplify what we provide in terms of our guiding information. And it’s taken the lessons we’ve learned from the volatility that we’ve all experienced over the last couple of years. And really just saying as best you can predict this year at $1,700gold, and here are numbers for this year. You look -- as you look forward into the out years, we are building mine plans on a $1,400 reserve price. And then, we will make assumptions around what the gold price will be for revenue and therefore, what that means in terms of taxes and royalties and those sorts of things. And linked to that is what do we assume for costs of producing that. So, that’s all flowing through more on an environment of what we predict the world to be. And we look to consensus numbers to drive that rather than have some sort of arbitrary gold revenue price number. But we build our mine plans on $1,400. And we expect to have -- you should expect from Newmont a $1 share base dividend year in, year out. It’s the variable component that will move year in, year out, depending on what’s happening in the gold price, what’s happening to input costs. And we’ll take consideration in terms of what the best we’ve got in the business. But $1 a share-based dividend, put it in the bank. That’s what Newmont would deliver at a $1,400 gold price.
Cleve Rueckert: All right. Just to clarify, I mean you’ve got the sensitivities on the guidance. Is that $1 base case dividend? Is that assuming kind of like $900 cash cost, $850 to $900 cash costs, or is it a lower level?
Tom Palmer: It’s -- the numbers, all the sensitivities you see there are linked to my $1,700 gold price assumption of moving around that. Our -- one, if gold went to -- if the price of gold went to $1,400, as a revenue Newmont would pay $1 a share dividend is what the base dividend is.
Cleve Rueckert: Yes, yes. All right. Okay. That makes sense. And then, I just wanted to follow-up. Emily asked the question earlier, but I just wanted to clarify on the declining costs, the costs decline specifically from ‘24 to ‘25. And I appreciate that you’ve got some volume growth built into the plan and that helps with the cost, but there isn’t any volume growth really at the midpoint from ‘24 to ‘25. So, is that mix -- you trading sort of higher cost volumes for lower cost volumes in the plan between those years?
Tom Palmer: That’s right. That’s where you’re starting to see lower cost ounces coming -- the more lower cost ounces coming into that profile from the investments that -- the investments we’re making in start to see ounces coming in from Tanami, ounces coming in from Ahafo North, ounces coming in from Pueblo Viejo, ounces coming in from Cerro Negro. So, it’s lower cost ounces coming into that production profile.
Cleve Rueckert: Yes. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. And then, just one last quick one for me. I just wanted to ask an operational question about Boddington. It had a good quarter. There’s been some volatility there around weather and around the autonomous fleet and obviously some learnings with the deployment of that fleet. I guess, are there any risks that you see around the autonomous fleet that you’re still monitoring? Or what’s the level of comfort there that you’ve kind of been able to iron out some of the -- I guess, some of the growing pains and really around the weather and some of the variables that the autonomous fleet might be a little bit more susceptible to?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Cleve. Bulletproof, 100% confident in autonomous haulage, is reliable. I implemented the first autonomous haul fleet in 2011. This is proven technology. It’s just new in the gold industry. This is bulletproof proven technology in the future of mining. And it’s safer, fundamentally safer and you do risk -- in a major cost area. So there was some fine tuning last year, some -- it’s some tight areas of the pit you’re mining in but that conventional trucks would have had similar issues with. So, let me just spell any myth about autonomous haulage. It is proven technology bullet proof at Boddington. And you can expect to see more autonomous fleets open pit and underground across the Newmont business going forward.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq: There is a sentence in the press release that talks about Yanacocha Sulfide and the different options up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. Can you just provide more color on what that would look like and what specifically that would mean for CapEx? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: So certainly, since we made the decision to defer the full funds approval by two years out to the second half of ‘24 and appointed Dean Gehring to Chief Development Officer focused on Peru and Yanacocha, Dean’s scope is to look at every option around Yanacocha Sulfides, including not proceeding with the project and putting the operation into care and maintenance. And that -- as we’ve talked about before, that is about making sure you go to the edge and understand the art of what might be possible in terms of a profitable project for Yanacocha Sulfides, because Yanacocha is one of the great gold and copper districts of the world. It is a huge sulfide deposit with both gold and copper, and it’s right next door to Conga, which is one of the great copper deposits. So strategically, long term, copper and gold will be produced from this part of the world. But part of Dean’s scope is to look at the full spectrum, and that could include us making a decision to move the existing operation into closure. The spend you see in our guidance is reflecting the spend that we would make this year and next year to get to full funds decision. We continue to -- the procurement of long lead time items and engineering and the construction of the camp. That camp will be necessary for closure, and it will be necessary for closure activities, in particular, the construction of a water treatment plant. So, those funds will be essential anyway. So, if we were to have a scenario that Yanacocha moved into closure, then you would see us building, which we would be doing in any event, water treatment plants to process the mine-affected water that contains acid and to treat that water to neutralize it and discharge it into surrounding systems. And that would be a lot at Yanacocha forever. We are at Yanacocha forever. Our closure liability estimates 50 years of water treatment. And that’s appropriately accounted for in our balance sheet, and we would steward that operation in the closure, if that was the decision that we recommended to our Board.
Fahad Tariq: That’s very clear. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad. And look, we’re here until we’ve answered all questions. So we’ll just keep working through everybody. If you’re able to stay with us, we’ll -- people in the queue and we’ll answer everybody.
Operator: The next question comes from Lawson Winder of Bank of America.
Lawson Winder: Thank you, operator, and good morning, Tom and Rob. Nice quarterly result. And thank you for remaining on the call to fit in these additional questions. I’d like to ask about your thinking around potential noncore assets. And so, in the context of when you acquired Goldcorp, you highlighted a few of the assets as potentially noncore. That would need to prove their worth to remain in the portfolio. So, in light of some of the impairments, I wanted to get your thoughts on whether any of these assets might now be under consideration for monetization.
Tom Palmer: Maybe just a quick bit of color over some of the impairments, which I think you’re seeing flow through the mining industry in general, just the -- when you’ve got the macroeconomic environments and country discount rates are playing into that. We’ve got some redistribution what we assumed for synergy value add of the Goldcorp acquisition where it came from, as Brian talked about, it’s a bit different. So, you’ve got some of that activity going on as we balance some of that out. And we strategically chose to move CC&V to a leach-only operation, and there’s some adjustments associated with the strategic decision around CC&V. Any well-run organization should have a very clear-eyed view on the assets that they manage, where the opportunities are to run them, where the opportunities might be to transform them, where the opportunities might be to grow them and ultimately, where there might be a time where those assets are better in someone else’s hands. And any well governed organization should have a clear view of each of their operating assets and their portfolio as a whole and ensuring that they are then taking decisions that are in the best interest of the shareholders of that organization. We do that work. That doesn’t mean that we have a whole list of assets set up for divestment. But similar to the answer I was just giving to Fahad around Yanacocha sulfides, it is essential as part of an exercise to go to the edge and say what would the world look like if that asset were divested? And what would we do if that was -- what would happen if that was in someone else’s hands? And what does that then mean for us in terms of what we could do with that operation in terms of improving its performance? So, we are constantly working through that process, challenging and debating. And with that set of 12 managed operations we have today, we have a very clear idea of the improvement opportunities that we want to get after. In Canada, the border has really only opened up 6 or 7 months ago. As Rob said, we have got three very experienced general managers now in place across those operations. And Rob and I are focused on delivering the value from those operations that we haven’t had a full license to do because of not being able to get across the border into Canada, having the operations shut down at different times, having covered protocols in place, ‘23 is the year where we start to demonstrate what those assets can do. So clear eyed view, Lawson, about our portfolio. But in terms of ‘23, we are very much focused on delivering value from our 12 managed operations.
Lawson Winder: Okay, fantastic. I’d like to also ask about Ghana sort of as a jurisdiction. So, two of your African-based peers have had some sort of minor tax disputes. But from a Newmont point of view, outside of the requirement to sell gold to the government in [indiscernible], I mean I’ve seen nothing similar, perhaps a reflection of your excellent local relationships there. Do you see any signs of fiscal regulatory environment changing in Ghana at all? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. We’ve obviously been in Ghana for 20 years. I think we’re the largest taxpayer in Ghana, and we pay our taxes in U.S. dollars. So, we’re a pretty important player in the Ghanaian context. And we have long-term robust relationships with all stakeholders in Ghana, including the government. You’ve only got to look at the coordinated process that we have been going through to get full land access to Ahafo North, involving the traditional leaders, youth and traditional leaders at the -- around the mine site, working with the [indiscernible] working with several levels of government to productively and sustainably work through that process. Those relationships also apply to when you sit down and talk about how we can support the government to pay fair taxes, but also to support investment in the country and to help manage through that process. So, we are very confident of our position in Ghana, the relationships and our standing to be able to navigate through some of the noise that you read about at the moment.
Lawson Winder: Excellent. And if I could maybe ask a very similar question just on Argentina. So, thinking about Cerro Negro and the somewhat difficult financial regulatory environment there. Is Newmont currently successful extracting profits from that operation? And that’s it for me. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. The phase of -- that we’re in at Cerro Negro is actually reinvesting back in the business. So, as we’re generating a profit from a mine, as Rob said, it’s getting more and more profitable, we’re sinking that money back in to some pretty significant expansion at Cerro Negro with several underground mines being developed. That will, in future years, increase production with lower cost ounces. So, at this point in time, we’re in a position where that profit we’re generating, we’re putting back into that Cerro Negro business.
Operator: The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for operator for getting my name right. That’s great. Just wanted to ask in a different way, it is about the Newcrest offer. I just wanted to confirm, Tom, that you did say that you are in negotiations with Newcrest right now. You’ve taken their proposal on providing you with the nonpublic information or a nonexclusive basis. And obviously, they wanted a signature, a non-compete on that. I just wanted to confirm that that’s what you said.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. We haven’t been going that long. I think it’s still morning in Toronto somewhere...
Tanya Jakusconek: Well, I’ve been up very early.
Tom Palmer: It’s lunch time. Look, Tanya, the best thing I can do is just repeat what I said, which is we are disappointed that the Newcrest Board rejected our proposal, and we are currently engaging with the Newcrest team in relation to their offer to provide access to more information. And I better leave it at that in terms of repeating that statement.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. From a bigger picture then, you talked about Newmont taking pride in their ESG record and ESG focus. So, I guess, I have a question that does pertain to this deal, but just how do you think about submarine tailings disposals? Is that something that meets your filter for ESG on how you look at that?
Tom Palmer: Thank you, Tanya. And again, I’ll attempt to answer this question without straying into those specifics. Newmont are actually experts in submarine tailings. We use that technology at Minahasa in Indonesia and at Batu Hijau, very successfully. And I was -- if you remember, I was the Senior Vice President for Indonesia and accountable for Batu Hijau when it was in Newmont, and I kept that accountability as I became Senior Vice President for Asia Pacific and then the Chief Operating Officer. So within the Newmont organization, there is a lot of knowledge and capability around submarine tails. So, if I then answer your question more broadly, as I’ve said many times before, our radar is turned on. And if we see opportunities to pick up a Tier 1 asset that we believe is a core capability, whether they be open pit or underground, we will look at that that opportunity irrespective of where it is in the world is a first instance. And if an asset had submarine tailings or some other aspect, one of the questions we would ask is we then step through those filters, is is that asset better in the Newmont portfolio or someone else’s, and can a sustainable performance be delivered by the Newmont operating model and the Newmont capability? Now with discipline, many times, we might say, no, not prepared to do that. But we wouldn’t -- not have our filter trip because it had some aspect such as submarine tails or some other aspect that may be an environmental or social aspect. Again, if I bring it back to Peñasquito, we’ve got to look at Peñasquito and say, goodness me. I don’t think anyone can resolve the community blockades. That’s a big risk for Newmont. We backed ourselves and our capability to go on their and resolve that social issue sustainably. So, we wouldn’t stop us looking at a particular opportunity because of a particular social, environmental issue, but we would we will reflect upon our capabilities and whether that asset is better in Newmont’s portfolio or not.
Tanya Jakusconek: Now that’s a fair answer. And then, just maybe finally for -- because I do also cover Newcrest. Just maybe on the -- any dealings with Australia usually takes a lot in terms of closing a transaction. So hypothetically, if the deal was to occur, could you just review and walk through us what is needed, obviously, shareholder approvals, and then obviously, what [Technical Difficulty] would be?
Tom Palmer: Sorry, Tanya. I’m not able to get into that detail because of where we sit. I’d just say Australia is a jurisdiction. We’ve been basically in Australia by a few years in the ‘90s for almost 60 years. We’re a taxpayer in Australia. We’ve got two big gold mines in Australia. We’re exploring in Australia. It’s our backyard. So, I can’t talk about your particular question, but Australia is literally our backyard.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Greg Barnes of TD Securities.
Greg Barnes: Hi Tom, sorry to drag this on. On the variable portion of the dividend on the old framework you paid out 40% to 60% of free cash flow with it. I don’t see mention of that this time around. Is the variable really just at your discretion, or is there a formula behind that?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg, and good morning. We can certainly get Daniel take you through that in detail. But it does -- the numbers do add up. So, for every $100 increase in gold price above that $1,400, we generate $400 million of free cash flow out of our portfolio on average over the -- as you look at that portfolio going forward. So, to do a notch up from 1,400 to 1,700 is $1.2 billion. But for ‘23, we’ve got to take off $400 million of that because of the reinvestment this year. That gives you $800 million. And we’re returning between 40% and 80% of that amount through that dividend range we provided. So that ratio still holds with the map, and we can certainly jump into the detail with you offline, if you want.
Greg Barnes: No. That’s fine. That works. Thanks, Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg. Is that it for questions, operator?
Operator: Yes. This actually concludes the question -- oh, go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Sorry to jump across you. Thank you, everyone, for staying on to answer all the questions. And please have a good day. And look forward to -- for those investors on the call, look forward to seeing some of you next week. Okay. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Newmont’s third quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team. And we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.  Newmont delivered a solid third quarter, and we remain well-positioned to respond to the challenging market environment that our industry faces today. As we have done for more than 100 years, Newmont continues to leverage our leadership, collective experience and the strength of our global portfolio with the size and scale to build a resilient and sustainable future. Supported by our clear long-term strategy, we continue to focus on doing what we do best, delivering stable production from our responsibly managed portfolio of world-class assets, while investing in our future and creating value for all of our stakeholders. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and nearly 300,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, as improved productivity and higher grades helped to offset the typical wet season impacts we experience every third quarter at our operations in the Southern Hemisphere. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance ranges as we build momentum for strong production in the fourth quarter. We continue to reinvest into our business, advancing our near-term projects, including the construction of the production shaft at Tanami and the development of our new mine, Ahafo North, along with the layback of the Porcupine and the first wave of District expansions at Cerro Negro. With $6.7 billion in total liquidity, we have maintained an investment-grade balance sheet with the financial flexibility to balance steady investment into our most profitable growth projects with strong shareholder returns. Last week, we declared a third quarter dividend of $0.55, set within our established dividend framework, which is calibrated at an $1,800 gold price. This dividend demonstrates our confidence in our diverse global portfolio and our commitment to providing leading returns to shareholders. During the third quarter, we published our inaugural Tax and Royalty Contribution report, providing an overview of our tax strategy and economic contributions. As the world's leading gold company, we have a responsibility to generate shared value through our contributions in taxes and royalties, as well as job creation and economic development in the host communities and countries where we operate. And we believe that transparency is a prerequisite for building and maintaining trust with all of our stakeholders. You can find this report on our website along with several others that provide details around our non-financial reporting and leading approach to environmental, social, and governance matters. In early 2020, Newmont made a symbolic change around how we manage our safety performance. Stepping away from the mining industry's traditional use of a lagging personal injury rate in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. During the third quarter, we completed more than 160,000 interactions by our leaders in the field that were focused on these controls. This is a process we call critical control verifications. Since we made this change more than two years ago, our leaders have now completed over 1 million critical control verifications, proactively identifying and managing the risks that could lead to a fatality, and helping to ensure that our workforce returns home safely to their families and friends after each and every shift. At Newmont, we have a diverse global portfolio of operations that we are managing to safely and responsibly deliver steady production over the long-term. This year, we again expect to produce 6 million ounces of gold and 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Consistent with our full year outlook, and the most of any company in our industry. This year is very similar to last year with higher production expected in the fourth quarter to bring home a strong finish to the year. This production will be driven by higher grades at both Boddington and Merian, in addition to improved mining rates and mill performance, increased production from Subika Underground at Ahafo as mining rates improve with access to additional drill points, which, in turn, would deliver higher grade ore to the mill, improved productivity at our Canadian operations, where each site is positioned to deliver higher grade during the fourth quarter, and higher production expected from Nevada Gold Mines, driven by both higher grade and higher tons mined from open pits at Carlin and Cortez, along with improved auto claim performance at Turquoise Ridge. In addition to higher production volumes, we also expect to have lower unit costs in the fourth quarter, as we continue to take action to reduce or offset our exposure to elevated input prices and labor costs. We are working on improving productivity through increasing and optimizing truck payloads in both our open pit and underground haul truck fleets, improving underground development rates through increased equipment effectiveness, and the implementation of jumbo bolting and operations where this machine has not been used before. And leveraging our asset management operation support network, which is now remotely monitoring 3,500 fixed and mobile assets on a continuous basis. Through this work, we have seen full truck lives increase by 85% and truck engine lives increase by 40%. We're also working to reduce our consumption of high-cost input materials through the use of new technology and alternatives. For example, we are on track to achieve a 25% reduction in grinding media consumption through the use of high chrome specialty forge falls which have a much lower wear rate than the traditional steel bowl. We are also reducing our consumption of cyanide through the use of best practice process control logic across our 12 operations. Importantly, we are continuing to drive to lock in best-in-class prices, reduce volatility in our long-term contracts, and manage our supply chains to ensure that we have key materials and consumables in sufficient quantities, across all of our operations. The impact from these cost and productivity measures, coupled with higher production volumes, have us on track to deliver lower unit costs in the fourth quarter, giving us the confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance for 2022. I'll now turn it over to Rob for a more detailed look at our performance during the third quarter, and what we can expect this quarter from our 12 managed operations and near-term projects. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, between Tom and I, we had the opportunity to visit 6 of our 12 managed operations, including Penasquito, Tanami, Merian, Porcupine, Cerro Negro and Cripple Creek & Victor. It's been very impressive to see firsthand the resilience and the dedication that our people continue to demonstrate each and every day. Last month, I was also able to spend some time in Nevada meeting with the new leader of NGM, Peter Richardson, and his extended team. It was a good opportunity to review the important work NGM is doing to further strengthen our culture and continue to improve operating performance. And as Tom just described, across our global business, we are putting a significant focus on and the effort into improving safety, cost and productivity. So turning to the next slide, let's get into my update, starting with our operations in Africa. Akyem remained a solid contributor in the third quarter, with higher tonnes mined, steady grade and sustained mill performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see an 8% increase in grade and a 30% increase in ore tonnes mined as we re-sequence our mining resources from the current layback due to being significantly ahead of our planned phase positions. As a result, Akyem is on track to deliver its strongest production performance of the year in the fourth quarter. Moving Ahafo South. Grade and mining rates continued to improve through the third quarter, increasing gold production by 20,000 ounces compared to the second quarter. We expect production at Ahafo to increase yet again in the fourth quarter on the back of higher grades from the Subika open pit, combined with an increase of high-grade ore tonnes from Subika Underground. We now have up to 20 draw points available in the Subika Underground and with similar numbers expected in Q4, we are in a strong position to deliver on the increase in ore tonnes. We also continue to ramp-up development work in Subika Underground, achieving record production drill meters, while continuing to advance the development of the third production level in the mine. An additional underground production drill arrives in November, further assisting the delivery of the planned development for the fourth quarter and the resulting ore tonnes in 2023. And finally, we continue to progress the development of our new greenfield mined Ahafo North. Engineering is more than 90% complete and procurement sits at 70%, with the first wave of heavy mining equipment having been delivered and assembled on site and is now ready to commence work. We are continuing to progress towards gaining full land access with approximately 75% of all the required activities now complete, including crop and land compensation and resettlement negotiations. Important stakeholder engagement work with local communities, traditional leaders and regulators continue, and we remain on track to gain full land access for this important project in early 2023. And now turning to our operations in South America. Cerro Negro delivered another solid performance in the third quarter, as lower ore grade was largely offset by strong mill performance compared to the second quarter. Productivity from this remote site continues to improve in particular, development meters, which have allowed us to access higher grades from the Amelia deposit. And I'm also pleased to announce that Cerro Negro is the first mine in Argentina to implement the automine technology, a tele-remote operating system for underground loading and hauling. The implementation of this technology has eliminated safety risks associated with operator exposure underground, has allowed for the recovery of more ore from each of the stopes, has reduced equipment damage, and really importantly in the Argentinian context, increased underground working time. We've had tremendous success with tele-remote operations at our Australian and Canadian underground mines, and this is yet another example of the value-added through the rapid replication of leading practices across our global operations. Turning to Merian. We delivered slightly lower production compared to the second quarter due to very heavy rain in the third quarter and a mill maintenance shutdown. Merian is well-positioned to deliver a strong finish to the year as we sequence into approximately 5% higher grades in the Maraba pit and delivered improved mill performance versus Q3, as a result of improved availability from the maintenance work that was performed. And finally, Yanacocha continued to deliver solid results. We saw improved recoveries from the use of a richer leaching solution helping to offset lower tons mined and placed on the leach pads. And now over to our operations in North America. Penasquito delivered another very strong performance in the third quarter, increasing gold production by more than 50% due to higher grade from the Penasco pit, whilst maintaining steady levels of silver, lead and zinc production. It is important to note that 60,000 gold equivalent ounces and finished goods inventory at Penasquito was built up at the end of the quarter, as a shipment of gold bearing lead concentrate that was produced at the end of September was not sold until the fourth quarter, partly due to impacts on shipping logistics from earthquakes and heavy rain in Western Mexico. Looking ahead, and it is important to note, gold production from Penasquito is expected to decline in the fourth quarter as we mine around 35% lower gold grade ore from the Chile Colorado pit, which is part of our planned mine sequence in this large polymetallic mine. Moving to CC&V. We delivered steady production from higher tons mined in the third quarter. We expect production to remain consistent into the fourth quarter, as we continue to optimize ore placement and reduce unit costs at this leach-only operation. And turning to Canada. Eleonore, Musselwhite and Porcupine all delivered improved production in the third quarter, a combined increase of more than 20,000 ounces compared to Q2. At Eleonore, we continued to increase staffing levels, especially those associated with critical roles and improved productivity amid a very competitive labor market, delivering improved production from higher ore grade in the third quarter. In Q4, we will see an increase in the number of available stopes ready for ore extraction, improving our mining flexibility with four stopes available at all times. And we continue to increase our staffing levels. And importantly, we expect to be back to full complement by the end of this year. At Musselwhite, we delivered higher grade ore from the PQ deeps area in Q3 and expect an improvement in grade in the fourth quarter as we mine our first double lift stope in PQ Deeps. And finally, at Porcupine, we mined higher grades from both the Hoyle Pond and board and underground mines in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Hoyle Pond has a strong pipeline of stopes available, which will contribute towards a 10% higher grade compared to Q3. And in addition, as a result of the optimization of our maintenance plans, work on the primary crusher of Porcupine has been moved into 2023, allowing for higher mill availability during the fourth quarter. And we continue to progress work on the Pamour project, a layback with the ability to extend mine life at Porcupine through to 2035. The work to dewater Pamour has commenced, with the interim water pumping and treatment plant successfully starting up after receiving all of the necessary permits. And now turning to our two operations in Australia. Boddington delivered lower gold and copper production compared to the second quarter, as the site was impacted by very significant rainfall associated with some extreme winter weather in Australia Southwest, some network outages, which impacted the autonomous haul truck fleet, and lower mill throughput due to crusher and conveyor maintenance in August were also contributors to Boddington's third quarter performance. Boddington is well positioned to finish the year strongly, as we sequence into a section of [indiscernible] with higher gold grades, approximately 12% higher than those in Q3. We have also resolved the network issues and Southwest Australia is now moving into the typical hot, dry summer weather pattern. And turning to Tanami, we delivered solid production results compared to the second quarter due to sustained ore grades, tons mined and mill performance, and we expect production to remain relatively consistent in the fourth quarter. We continue to progress the second expansion project at Tanami, and we have now reached an important project milestone, completing the reaming of the 1.5 kilometer deep production shaft and the installation of the head frame and hoisting infrastructure. Lining of the shaft has commenced. And in the photo, you can see it being lowered into the shaft, what is called the stage or a Galloway. And that will be used to conduct this specialized work. Shaft lining will take around two years to complete and will be conducted in parallel with the installation of the major underground infrastructure such as crushers, conveyors, orbans [ph] and pumping stations. The underground development work is largely completed, and we are now commencing the associated civil and structural works and we look forward to providing further details on this important project during our 2023 guidance webcast. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.
Nancy Buese: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a look at the financial highlights. In the third quarter, Newmont delivered $2.6 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,691 per ounce, and adjusted EBITDA of $850 million, with our free cash flow being impacted by unfavorable working capital movements of more than $300 million in the third quarter. These items included a $95 million payment associated with the previously communicated Penasquito profit-sharing agreement reached during the second quarter. An $83 million payment of accrued severance related to the planned Canadian employment model change, and $80 million of sales value from the buildup of inventory at Penasquito, as Rob has mentioned. In the third quarter, we invested nearly $700 million through capital, exploration and advanced project spend as we continue to progress our near-term projects, make progress toward achieving our climate targets and orient the portfolio for the future of Newmont. Last week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share for the eighth consecutive quarter, in alignment with our dividend framework and calibrated at an $1,800 gold price. Compared to the second quarter, adjusted net income declined $0.19 despite relatively consistent production and direct costs. This was due to lower metal prices for copper, gold, silver and zinc, as average realized gold prices decreased nearly $150 per ounce in the third quarter. In addition to lower metal prices, we also experienced lower sales volumes during the third quarter, driven by the timing of concentrate sales at Penasquito. These impacts, along with other material items resulted in third quarter adjusted net income of $212 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Underpinned by the largest production base in the sector, Newmont has established a healthy liquidity position to allow for balance sheet strength and flexibility in light of the current global economic conditions. During my tenure at Newmont, we have intentionally worked to provide clarity around our discipline and capital allocation, and a set of principles for how we reinvest in our business and provide returns to shareholders, grew our cash balances of $3.7 billion with total liquidity of $6.7 billion, while returning more than $6 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks since 2019, responsibly managed our long-term debt through refinancing at historically low coupon rates and in alignment with our ESG targets and achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.5 times., below our target of 1.0 times. With an investment-grade balance sheet and no debt due until 2029, Newmont's financial position provides a platform on which to support the next decade of production performance and reinvestment into the business. As I reflect on the last six years I've spent at Newmont, I am so proud of the work that we have accomplished to build financial strength and flexibility as well as the framework for our capital priorities. And as I move to my next opportunity, I remain confident that Newmont will continue to prioritize long-term value to its shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, Nancy. And building on your comments, we have maintained a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, a key component in sustainably managing and mining business through the commodity cycles. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and follow a clear hierarchy. First and foremost, to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet with financial strength and flexibility. Second, to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth. And finally, to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks. From the robust foundation of our balance sheet that Nancy just described, our next capital allocation priority is to sustainably reinvest in value-accretive projects from our industry-leading organic pipeline. Our long-term outlook assumes an annual investment of around $1 billion in sustaining capital, $800 million in development capital, and $400 million in exploration and studies. Combined, this is an average annual investment of more than $2 billion every year, a critical component in Newmont's strategy to sustain strong production levels and improved margins over the long-term. We have entered a period of meaningful reinvestment, as we continue to advance our near-term projects, including the expansion of Tanami in Australia, the Ahafo North in Ghana, and Yanacocha Sulfides in Peru. In September, we announced that we had made a disciplined decision to delay the full funds approval of our Yanacocha Sulfides project in order to manage project execution risk, move out of a period of significant inflation, and to balance our development capital cash flows. To support this decision, I've also taken one of our best leaders in Dean Gehring to rigorously review the scope and pace of this project. As part of this work, Dean is stepping back and reviewing the Sulfides project in total, which will include assessing a range of scope and scheduled scenarios through to and including the impacts of not proceeding at all. And as Dean progresses his work over the coming months, we will continue to keep you updated. So, on the back of a strong balance sheet and reinvesting into our business, our final capital allocation priority is to return excess cash to our shareholders. Two years ago, Newmont was the first in the gold industry to announce a clear dividend framework, providing our shareholders with a base dividend calibrated at our reserve price assumption of $1,200 per ounce. In addition, our shareholders have the potential to receive between 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow we generate at gold prices above our base assumption. Now, as we do at this time every year, we are currently working through our annual business planning process. As part of this exercise, there are two key inputs to our dividend framework that we are critically reviewing. The first, as I've been discussing for some time now, is the long-term gold price and the assumption we use for both reserve pricing and project approvals. This assumption is a key input for determining the payout level of our base dividend. The second key input is the free cash flow we expect to generate above this base level, and this is impacted by the current global economic environment that we are all operating in. Over the next month, we will finalize and our Board will approve our business plan. We will then provide a comprehensive update on these inputs and associated outputs with our long-term outlook during our 2023 guidance webcast. However, I can assure you that we clearly understand the importance of returning cash to our shareholders, and we have a proven track record of doing so. With our third quarter dividend declared, we will return nearly $4 billion through dividends since we introduced our framework two years ago. We will continue to take a long-term view to determine the appropriate level of current dividend payouts, and we remain committed to a clear dividend framework. Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to thank Nancy Buese for her exemplary leadership and sound guidance during this transformative period in Newmont's history. Nancy has built a very capable and dedicated team that will continue to strengthen our financial position and support our capital priorities for a long time to come. And we wish Nancy all the very best for her next opportunity with Baker Hughes. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator, open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks very much and thanks for the update everyone. I guess, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the dividend framework. In the past, it's a percentage of free cash flows above that $1,200 gold price. And it's apparent in the last couple of quarters, I mean, you've kept the dividend stable, but that free cash flow number has maybe gone down, so the percent is outside of your stated range. When you finalize your new dividend framework, whatever that's going to look like, do you have any thoughts to maybe making that a little bit more flexible or calling it maybe a guideline instead of a hard rule to reflect the reality of how you're using the dividend framework anyway? So can you give a little bit of color into your thoughts around the structure or how structured it will be going forward? Thanks.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Jackie. Good morning. What you can expect to see with our framework is something that's consistent with what is out there today. So we're committed to that framework, but we will update it in terms of an assumption that we will update our reserve pricing. So that inevitably will lead to a higher base dividend from the $1,200 and then everything will shunt across. So for argument sake, if we went to a reserve price of $1,300, then we would continue to move in $300 increments to $1,600 and $1,900 and then determine our payout at those levels. So you're going to see a framework that looks very similar to the one that we're operating under today. We will continue to take a long-term view to determine the appropriate level of dividend payouts and we'll do so through that framework that's going to look very similar to what you see today. And that long-term view will take into account both the historical gold price and our forward-looking view on gold price over the long term, so over a year or longer. And we'll include in that our expected free cash generation that's going to come from the longer-term outlook that we'll update you with our 2023 guidance webcast. So we look at the long term, Jackie, both gold price backwards and forward and our assumptions for it going forward, our long-term view going forward, and then we'll make some judgments about the free cash flow we generate and the rate of dividend that we pay out. We'll do that rather than look at a stand-alone period, whether it’d be a quarter or a six-month period. So we're going to maintain a framework that's going to look very similar to what it is today, and we're going to maintain a long-term view, both backward looking on gold price and forward-looking on gold price and the free cash flow that we expect to generate from our long-term outlook.
Jackie Przybylowski: Okay. Thank you. That's clear. I know this question was asked at Denver, but maybe thought it would be worth asking again, if there's any changes. You've got a lot of moving parts in your framework, including how much ore is classified as ore versus waste and everything, just given the change to the -- potentially the change to the gold price that you might use. Is it fair to say that if you raise the gold price in your framework, in your business plan and your reserve and resource calculation, is it fair to say that the dividend is most likely to go down? Do you have -- have you done enough work on that yet to make that determination?
Tom Palmer: Jackie, we're still in the middle of our business planning process. So that's still in flight. In terms of the cash flow generated at our new -- we assume we go to a new reserve price, the cash we generated at that new reserve price and then our leverage to higher gold prices off the back of our plan. An important factor that we still don't have, which comes every year during November, is the updated plan details from our two non-managed joint ventures, so Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo make up a pretty significant part of our portfolio. So we need to include and understand those inputs before we can make a final determination. So it's still premature to be flagging one way or the other. It's still very much a process that's in train.
Jackie Przybylowski: Appreciate that. Thanks. Thanks very much, Tom. That’s it for me.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Lawson Winder of BofA. Lawson, your line is open.
Lawson Winder: Hi. Good morning, Tom, Nancy and Rob, thank you for the update today. I wanted to ask actually on that exact point you just brought up, which is, you are waiting on the sort of gold price assumption from PV and Nevada Gold Mines. And what I was wondering is, I mean, will that help you determine what gold price you use for the other assets, or could we have a situation where you use one for Nevada Gold Mines and Pablo Viejo, and another for the 100% owned Newmont assets? Thanks very much.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson and good morning. When we think about reserve pricing, we'll use the reserve price number that the manager of both those assets use for determining their reserves. So, again, theoretically, if we chose a $1,400 reserve price and Barrick chose a $1,300 reserve price, we would declare our reserves on those two different prices. So we wouldn't try and have everything consistent. We would use the operator's reserve pricing, and we would make that very clear in our reserve and resource declarations.
Lawson Winder: Okay, great. Thanks for pointing that.
Tom Palmer: It won't be material, given the margins you see on both those operations, it's that sort of movement between reserve pricing is unlikely to me material.
Lawson Winder: Okay. Thanks very much. I also wanted to ask about the Ahafo North land access. So I mean, obviously, there's been several delays. But I mean for good reason, I understand that you guys are making sure you negotiate a very fair and long-lasting agreement. I just wanted to kind of better understand what steps are left? And then what factors kind of give you confidence that you think early 2023 is the time line for ultimately getting that access agreement?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. I'll kick off and maybe get Rob to add a bit more color. But what's really important in this process is patience. There's an old African proverb, and we're right in the middle of Africa in Ghana, that if you want to go fast, you go alone. If you want to go far, we go together. And if ever that's playing out, it's playing out at the Ahafo North, where it is absolutely essential that we bring all of the stakeholders along in the journey, so that when we have full unfitted access to that land, we have the support of all of those stakeholders and then we can get after that project to deliver value for the next couple of decades out of that mine as opposed to going fast and alone. And I would predict a project that would be disrupted over the course of its life. And we have learnt some hard lessons over 100 years in terms of the importance of bringing all your stakeholders along. So it's a very important principle that we apply. The gold isn't going anywhere. That project is going to be a terrific mine in the Newmont portfolio from about 2025, 2026 onwards and deliver great grade ounces at pretty good operating costs for a long time to come. But Rob, maybe if you to talk to the sorts of things that we see that give us confidence that we're in the pretty much in the home straight as we moved through November and December to early in the year getting full land access?
Rob Atkinson: Okay. Thanks, Tom, and thanks for the question, Lawson. Just building on what Tom said that we are making very significant progress. As I mentioned, we're up to 75%, and that includes demolishing removing structures, demolishing and removing fish ponds, et cetera. And that's certainly some of the most topical work that we've had to do. We continue to enjoy very, very strong support from the regional and also the national government. And we meet on a task force on a very, very regular basis, and that continues to progress well. So that gives us an enormous amount of confidence. We're not just talking about these things that you can see demonstrable progress on the ground itself. And I think the last part that I would just add is that Ghana is certainly in a challenging time financially. This project is very well supported by the government. It will bring significant employment, significant revenue, et cetera. So there's -- we're very confident that we are very much targeted for that land clearance being completed very early in the New Year.
Lawson Winder: Okay. Fantastic. And if I might, I'm not sure if Dean is on the line, but the language around the expected annual production at Yanacocha, I think before, it was like 500,000 to 525,000 GEO. That was removed. So would it be fair to interpret that, I mean, given the scope of this project is under review. So I mean it could be more or less sort of annual production if it does ultimately go ahead?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. I might kick off and Dean is sitting alongside me and I'll get him to build on it as well. The flow sheet for Yanacocha Sulfides is largely set. You've got a – a copper concentrator that then provides a concentrate feed into the autoclave and you've got high-grade ore from the Chaquicocha underground also provides setting the autoclave. Autoclave is sized. In fact, the autoclave is sitting in a factory in Turkey fabricated. And that really determines your throughput on those gold equivalent ounces that you'll get from gold, copper and silver. So really, these were -- the central case is to move through to a full funds approval in two years' time. But Dean is looking at testing a bunch of scenarios. Is it a schedule driven approach, is it a cost driven project, are there other ways that we can build some of the infrastructure smarter, are there some lessons we can learn from other projects around the world. So it's really going back -- stepping back and having a critical review of that project more about where you can bring capital cost down within the constraints of a flow sheet that's going to give you pretty similar gold equivalent ounces. But Dean, why don't you share your view on that?
Dean Gehring: Yeah, Tom. The one thing I would add to that is that as we continue to interrogate the scope of the project and the costs. We're also looking at the existing operations. And so as we continue to make improvements there, that provides a potential opportunity to extend oxide production, which is something we're also looking.
Rob Atkinson: So a key part of that, Lawson, is we're taking some technology that we developed at Cripple Creek and Victor, it's called injection leaching into the leach pads. And Yanacocha has got deep leach pads that we've been building and operating there for 30 years. And so there is an opportunity to take some of that technology and adapt it at Yanacocha and to extract more gold from the ore that we've already mined and placed on the heap leach pad. So how can we extend oxide production and also look at reducing costs at that on-site operation, which will then in turn support the economics of our sulfide project.
Lawson Winder: Thank you very, very much. And Nancy, best of luck in your next role.
Nancy Buese: Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Lawson.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Thanks for taking my two questions. Maybe first on the shipping logistics issues in Mexico. Can you just provide some more detail on what exactly happened? I haven't heard of your peers having similar issues within the country. And then also, has it been resolved now?
Tom Palmer: Good morning Fahad, I'll kick off and then pass to Daniel, who -- one of the hats Daniel wears, he is sales and marketing. So it's actually his area of accountability and he can give you some color in terms of what played out late in September. But as it turned out, we had a really nice shipment of good high-grade concentrate that we're looking to get off to market at the end of September. It was produced, in the trucks, heading down the port. And I'll pass to you, Daniel, to give some color to Fahad in terms of how that played out in terms of that shipment not being able to get to market before the end of September.
Daniel Horton: Yeah, definitely. Thanks, Fahad. Thanks for the question Fahad. Thanks Tom and thanks for the question Fahad. It's nothing unusual. I'd say it's really just a timing impact on the shipping logistics. There was a hurricane that came through the last week of the month. In September, there were a number of earthquakes that actually shut down for a couple of days. And just based on those impacts, it impacted our timing to be able to get the concentrate under the ships. Like Tom mentioned, there was some high gold grade that went into Yukon at the end of the month that was -- we hope to get out and interested, but your second question has been resolved. There is no issues with customers or shipping at this point, and we're moving forward. So that will be recognized in the fourth quarter, we should see a nice sales pickup from that.
Tom Palmer: And just building on that, Daniel, it's sold. So we're able to sell it very early in the fourth quarter, and there's not any systemic issue there Fahad. There's not something that's going to play out every quarter. It was an unusual combination of natural events of hurricane and number of earthquakes in quick succession was quite disturbing for that -- in that isolated part of Mexico, but very much a one-off a bit.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, that's clear. And then maybe just 1 more on Yanacocha and maybe Rob can weigh in on this. I noticed the cash cost came up quite substantially quarter-over-quarter, up about 34%. And then the presentation mentioned focusing on identifying opportunities to enhance performance. Maybe just touch a bit on the underlying kind of cost performance there, and if there's anything of note other than just lower production quarter-over-quarter that led to the higher cost? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Fahad. I'll pick up the -- in terms of the opportunity, it was a similar or linked to what we're just talking about with Lawson, is that an opportunity to look where we can extract more gold from the heap leach pads that we have sitting there at Yanacocha. It's really the opportunity to apply the -- what's called injection leaching really drilling holes, getting drill rigs on top of those high pads and drilling holes and then the out-of-pump solution that into those holes to be able to extract more gold and looking quite interesting in terms of where we might be able to extract some additional gold and be able to do so relatively low cost. And Daniel, just -- I'll try to you in terms of Fahad's question around the cash cost at Yanacocha. I don't remember any extending out in my quarterly reviews.
Daniel Horton: Yes. No, a looking at the numbers as well. Nothing that I can notice either. So, let's -- maybe we take that off-line and we'll follow-up.
Fahad Tariq: Yes, no problem. Sounds good. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Fahad.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tanya Jakusconek of Scotia Bank.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Good morning every one. Can you hear me?
Tom Palmer: Good morning Tanya. Yes, we can.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, great. Thank you. Nancy, congrats on our new role and best of luck. I have a couple of questions. I wanted to start off just on inflationary pressures. I'm just trying to understand if, number one, you're seeing any relief inflationary pressures in your cost structure. I know on the Q2 call, I asked the question how much inflation are you seeing? And I think Tom and Rob, you mentioned about 12%. Is that what you saw also in Q3? And then looking out, have you seen any relief in consumables, a bit in fuel for sure, that labor at all at -- in your portfolio? So, that's my first question.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya. What we saw through the third quarter was direct operating costs almost in line with the second quarter. And that similar percentage that we talked about. So, it's that inflation of around about that 12%. So, we didn't see it through the third quarter. But we are starting to see some relief across energy and consumable costs coming into the fourth quarter and then seeing that play out into 2023. I mean a couple of things I'd call out within that. One is that we'll have a bit of a lag in that fully starting to flow through, where we see some of that relief. We're building rise and fall adjustment mechanisms into a lot of our long-term contracts that protect against the volatility, but also mean that some of that relief takes a little longer to unwind. We're also running with greater inventory in some of those key consumables and so you've got that higher cost inventory, which is really about predicting production that has to flow through as well. So across diesel, steel, ammonia and cyanide, chemicals and reagents and grinding media. We are -- they make up about 45% of our cost base, and we are seeing some relief in those flowing into the fourth quarter, and we're anticipating that, that will flow into 2023. However, the world is still very volatile. And as we think about doing our business plans and making judgments about 2023, we're keeping a wary eye in terms of the level of volatility in the world. On labor costs, they are proving to be a bit stickier. Our -- about 60% of our labor cost. The labor cost makes up half of our direct costs. About 60% of that is employees, and that's pretty stable across the countries in which we operate in. We're seeing about a 4% increase on average across wages. So that's pretty robust. And as Rob was talking about, we're starting to build back up to full complement as we come out the other side of some of the COVID impacts in the second half of this year, starting to see some voluntary attrition numbers returned to more long-run levels. So seeing some stability starting to get back into our business and not seen tremendous escalation in our employee cost base. However, we're still seeing high levels of cost inflation on our contracted services. So the label we use, the shutdowns and out of jobs around the world. We’re still seeing in the order of 10% in our cost base over what we're seeing this time last year. We see that as sticky, and so we're starting to step back and say what do we need to do to think about doing our work differently in order to mitigate some of those cost impacts. And there's a number of levers that we're looking to pull to manage our costs. We're not sitting idly accepting costs coming at us. We're pulling a number of levers to improve our cost and productivity. And on the contractor side, we are actively looking at where we can bring contractors into our businesses, namely employees rather than contracted services, very much looking at doing that across some of our Canadian operations and looking to do that in Ghana at both Ahafo and Akyem. So not accepting that we pay those higher costs and look at what actions we can take to reduce that cost base.
Tanya Jakusconek: Thanks for that. That was another thing I just wanted to know, was the percentage of contractors you had and how can you kind of buffer that 10% cost. So that's good to hear. I appreciate the insights into that. My second question would be on Ahafo North, and I know we have done 75% of what you need to do. I think that's what Rob's number that he gave, yes, of all activities has been completed. Can I just understand from 75%, so we've got another 25% to do from now until early next year? Can I just try and understand what are the critical, like, examples of what needs to be done from now until early next year, that 25%?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Tanya. I'll get Rob to provide a little bit of color on that. It's going to be more of the same. We're basically following a project plan that's got the work we've got -- well, we have been doing to get to 75%. It's continuing on that pathway to get the final 25% done.
Rob Atkinson: That's correct and good morning, Tanya. The two critical elements are just that to complete the demolition of all the structures and we're expecting that to be done in the next five, six weeks. And then it's finalizing the remainder of the payment, which is the end of the year. And again, that's just working very, very closely with the impacted farmers and other people like that. So it really boils down to those two key elements. And as Rob indicated, it is some remarks during the presentation, tenure, the -- the first of the heavy mobile fleet is on the ground assembled. So as soon as we pass that milestone, we're able to mobilize equipment pretty readily to start clearing rig ground in the initial mining area, starting the civil works around the processing facility.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. That's good. Thank you for that. And then my final question is just coming back to Yanacocha and this injection leaching that you are now doing in the old leach pads. A couple of questions on this. Number one, are you then expecting the oxide production from the existing operations to be longer i.e., you're expecting more years of this than you had originally anticipated in your previous life of mine plans, which means that you have a bit more of time to make a decision on Yanacocha sulfides. Is that how I should think about it?
Rob Atkinson: Tanya, I'll kick off and get Dean provide some more color. Well, certainly, when we provide our updated guidance, we'll incorporate the additional ounces that we expect to come from just the work we've done to date on this. The oxide mine at Yanacocha will move into closure. I mean Sulfides is really just a pimple on the disturbed area at the Yanacocha. I mean it's -- Yanacocha disturbed 75% – an area that's equivalent to 75% of the island of Manhattan. Sulfides is a small footprint for a processing facility, a small underground mine and a small layback at one of the open pits. So we will continue to extract as much oxide gold as we can from existing heap leach pads. And then that facility will move into closure as we exhaust the oxide ore that we're mining. But Dean, do you want to build on that at all?
Dean Gehring: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that is that we will be doing water treatment activities for a number of years there. So we'll continue to look for any opportunity we can to – to produce gold through injection leaching or other small heap leaches that we can put into operation. So it could potentially extend a couple of years, but that's work can we see in front of us. And as Tom said, that will be put forward in guidance to come.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And just as a bigger picture, maybe for you, Tom. As you look at the Yanacocha Sulfides in, I think in your comments, you said maybe this isn't built it off and that's the decision made. How do we look at M&A now for you? Is M&A moved up higher in your profile in terms of you've got your Tanami Phase 2 coming on, you've got Ahafo north. This gets pushed out. Does M&A play a role now? Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. I would a couple a review of sulfides to doing something differently on the inorganic front. I would -- two things I'd say. One is Dean's work is very important that you bring someone like Dean in to look at a project like Sulfides, you do get back and go to the edge to say, what would it look like if we didn't proceed with this project because that can often lead you to some pathways that have a more value-accretive project that we could develop. Bearing in mind that we're sitting on a fabulous -- this is a copper project. So we're sitting on a fabulous copper deposit with multiple lives once that processing plant is built and you've got the Congo copper deposits beyond that. So there's a strategic element around Yanacocha. But we must step back and look at all options and go to the precipice because I think we'll learn a few things by doing that. We would then -- if there was a scenario where we decided to put sulfides on the shelf for a period of time; then next step for us would be to go back into our organic project pipeline and say what else is in there that stacks up in terms of projects we may report. We've got the Coffee project up in the Yukon. We've got opportunities around Ahafo, further opportunities around Tanami. So we would examine other projects in organic project pipeline as alternatives to a different scenario around Yanacocha. Inorganically, I see that as a separate exercise. We have a set of operations and organic project pipeline that can comfortably sustain 16 ounces of gold for at least the next decade. With that, we've shared that with the market before, and we'll continue to share that with the market. For us, on the inorganic side, it's having the radar turned on. And if we see projects or assets or companies out there that we believe underneath the Newmont operating model, we could add more value from. We would -- and they came on to our radar passed through our filters, we would have a good hard look at that. But I would certainly see that separate to the work we do with our current set of operations and our organic project pipeline.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Thank you. But I noticed that you didn't mention Nueva Union and Norte Abierto, would those be lower priority down versus what you mentioned coffee, Ahafo, Tanami, et cetera, would that be lower priority for you?
Tom Palmer: No, I wouldn't assume or infer that, because I didn't mention that, that would be a lower priority. You've got Galore Creek, Nueva Union, Norte Abierto. They absolutely would be part of that assessment. That's added complexity with those three projects because they're all joint ventures. But absolutely, as you look at our organic project pipeline and the gold and copper content in those projects and where we see the world inevitably going in terms of the demand for copper, they would be very much in that equation as we assess our internal organic options.
Tanya Jakusconek: Thank you so much. I’ll leave it to someone else ask question. Appreciate the insights.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya. And operator, we'll continue through the top of the hour and continue to take questions until we've exhausted the list.
Operator: Great. Our next question is from the line of Anita Soni of CIBC. Anita, please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Hi. Good morning, everyone and congratulations, Nancy, on your new role at Baker Hughes and best of luck. So firstly, I guess I wanted to dig a little bit more on the cost going into the second, I guess, the Q4 and then also into 2023. So we've seen like a $30 per ounce incremental quarter-over-quarter over the last three quarters. Could you give us an idea as we go into Q4, like you've given us on asset level, but just an overall ballpark increase in production that you're seeing like in the order of 10%, 15%, 20%, just to get an idea of like what cost relief we could see going into Q4?
Tom Palmer: Good morning Anita. I'll kick off and I might get Rob and Daniel to chip in as well. When you look at our unit costs for the fourth quarter, we're certainly looking at our strongest production quarter. So we're going to get the benefit of the additional ounces sold, improving our unit costs. And we'll also have the benefit of those that concentrate sale that did get away in the third quarter, sitting in our fourth quarter. So that will play on the denominator side of the unit cost for the direct costs. we're certainly starting to see some relief through the fourth quarter, but that's got to actually wash out in terms of some of the flow-through on rise and fall in our contracts and inventory that we're carrying. So, I would expect that the direct costs for the fourth quarter are going to be reasonably flat compared to the third quarter because of that flow through. And then if we continue to see that relief, it's more likely to be what we might see presenting in the -- into 2023. And as I said with an answer to the earlier question, with a caveat that we're still in a very volatile world and what may or may not play out around the world geopolitically and the impact that has on cost is something that is -- we need to be very careful about. Rob or Daniel, anything you'd add in terms of additional color on that?
Rob Atkinson: Not for me, Tom. The only thing I'd certainly say it is that there is an enormous amount of focus on the cost. And whether it's the quotes that we're getting for sustaining capital, whether it's as I mentioned at a team that prioritizing what we're actually doing based on the mining phases, et cetera, to make sure that we're managing costs just as closely as we're managing production. But aside from what Tom added, I don't have much more to say. Daniel?
Daniel Horton: Yes. Anita, I think the only thing to mention is, obviously, our royalties and taxes would come down in the fourth quarter with the lower gold, right? So, that -- we have those sensitivities out there in those materials. But aside from that direct cost seem to be consistent with the third quarter.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then I guess, moving into 2023, a couple of questions. You said on the last Q2 conference call that you were sort of looking at a $900 per ounce and 6 million-ounce outlook for the next couple of years in 2023-2024. Is there any change to that? And I guess what I'm trying to drive at is, it seems like the costs are a little bit higher even with this inventory release that you're talking about, a little bit higher than that number that you were previously talking about at $900. And the second part of that question is, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of production versus when you're talking about labor. Like is there development issues? You mentioned at Eleonore, you're getting back to full staffing levels. But is that something we should be thinking about in terms of when we look at the production gearing towards 6 million ounces? Big question. I know, sorry.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Anita. So, still very much seeing 2023 playing out, as I indicated on the last call, in round numbers, it's looking like around the 6 million ounces again and around about that $1,200 per ounce cost. We will see some relief--
Anita Soni: $900. Sorry, did you say $1,200 or $900?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. So, $900 would be that [indiscernible] 
Anita Soni: Okay, all right.
Tom Palmer: Same number. So, no change, Anita. The we're still washing through to understand some of this relief in those direct costs coming through. And the other caveat is a significant percentage of our base is our non-managed joint ventures. And so we're still to see Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo come in. Everything I've seen today would point to 6 million ounces for 2023 and around about that $900. 2024 is where we are starting to see some relief come through, both in terms of what we're seeing come through on some of the input costs, whether it be energy, some of our key consumables. But also, we're not sitting idly as Rob and I were talking about and the work we're doing on bringing costs down and improving productivity. We're actively working those. We're looking for those to shore up and to support 2023, but certainly delivering improved cost performance into 2024. So I'm not sitting on my hand saying 2024 is going to look exactly the same at 2023. I'm working on 2024, have an improved position on 2023, because then we get into 2025, when we do start to get the benefit of the lower cost ounces from both Tanami 2 and Ahafo North. So we then will see some increase in production and improvement in cost on the back of those investments that we're making. So 2023, we're looking pretty similar. 2024, we were working hard to have an improvement in costs at steady production. And anything that we can bring into 2023 will aim to do as upside.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then just one last question, if I may. You mentioned that the last -- I think the last thing you said was that, on Yanacocha Sulfide that you were also assessing the impact of not moving forward at all with that. Could you just remind us what your current assessment of the liability, close liability would be on Yanacocha Sulfides?
Tom Palmer: The couple of important things to note there, the closure liability sits at around just over $3 billion. But it's important that the Yanacocha -- the oxide operation at Yanacocha moves into closure, regardless of Sulfides. Sulfides is Yanacocha underground mine, a small layback on the Yanacocha Verde open pit and the construction of the processing facility for that ore. The rest of that operation, all of the waste dumps, all of the old open pits, all the heap leach dumps, move into closure, irrespective of any decisions we make or their timing around Yanacocha Sulfide.
Anita Soni: Okay. So how would we think about that -- the spend on that $3 billion over the course of, I guess, the next five to 10 years?
Tom Palmer: Yes. So if you think about the money we'll spend at Yanacocha, the big-ticket item are the water treatment plants. So there are two large asset water treatment plants that we are constructing. We're actually doing the study work just to gear up to build and then will build through 2023, 2024 and 2025 will commission around 2026. And that's to take all the mine impacted water, so it's got asset in it. Treat that water so we can discharge that to the environment. These are very large water treatment plants. So there's an expenditure on those plants. And I think we've indicated to the market that we'll spend $350 million through 2023 and 2024 on those water treatment plants. That's the big closure spend. Then there's the work you do on rehabilitation and some moving some old infrastructure. And then you've got the ongoing cost of processing water in perpetuity at Yanacocha, which is what closure is. It's collecting that water, processing and discharging it. So once you get through the other side of that investment in water treatment plants over the next four or five years, then you've got a long run spend on running water treatment plants for imperpetuity and that closure liability assumes that cost for the next 50 years. About 75% of that cost is the cost of water treatment over the next 50 years.
Anita Soni: Got it. Okay. All right. And then last one, sorry, if I may, because it reminded me that you were doing some work on tailings rehabilitation in terms of -- I guess, trying to get an assessment on costs, I guess, the Denver Gold Forum. On the tailings dam that you had highlighted that didn't meet the international standards. Have you -- could you provide a little bit more color on what we should expect there in terms of the cost to remediate Borden and Tanami and -- I think it's Porcupine and Musselwhite as well.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Anita. It's an important one to clarify that every mining company that is a member. So the 26 companies that are members of the International Council of Mines and Metals, so ICMM, have committed to implementing the global industry standard on tailings management. That's the standard that we developed in conjunction with the United Nations and the Church of England post the tragedy of Brumadinho. And so, that standard has some requirements that every one of those mining companies to ensure that they are addressing their extreme or very high consequence specified tailings dams by August 2023 and then all others by August 2025. So there's some clear commitments made by ICMM members. So we are assessing the work that we need to do around our facilities. So as you pointed out, there are facilities at Porcupine, at Penasquito, Ahafo, Yanacocha and Akyem. And the work involves additional buttressing at different locations, as you assess those current constructions against that global standard. And in some instances, it may be that the next lift we do is to a different design standard. So rather than be an upstream lift or a modified centreline has to be a full downstream lift, so that every mining company will be assessing their tailings facilities. And my expectation is that every mining company will be identifying additional costs to comply to this standard to improve our management of tailings facilities as an industry. What we’re seeing -- 
Anita Soni: Sorry, is the requirement to go to all downstream facilities. Is that what the requirement is or you said -- 
Tom Palmer: No, it's a requirement to make an assessment for that dam in its circumstances and that may mean that where someone has been able to do a particular type of lift, you've got to go to a more robust lift. That would be my expectation. We're certainly seeing areas where we're putting additional buttressing in as a consequence of our assessment work and at different times, we'll use a different technique for lifting for the next lift on a dam. And we're not Robinson Crusoe, we're not unusual. And I would anticipate that other mining companies will be going through exactly that same exercise. 25% of our sustaining capital budget of our $1 billion is on tailings.
Anita Soni: Yes.
Tom Palmer: Tailings and water. When we look at our sustaining capital budgets going forward, we typically, for a business of our size, spend about $1 billion, I would anticipate that's probably got to go more like $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion going forward, and a good proportion of that will be associated with the additional work we're doing on tailings and some of it will be linked to energy and decarbonization projects as well. So, as I'm looking at our long-term view, $1 billion for a company of Newmont's size is probably going to be $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion going forward. Tailings is an important component of that. Rob, did you want to jump in?
Anita Soni: Okay.
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Just a couple of other things, Anita, is that, about the upstream, if there are companies that do choose the upstream method obviously, the level of scrutiny that's going to be required for those is going to be very, very significant. But given I was just recently in Nevada, and we were overlooking Carlin, I know that Nevada Gold Mining team are planning and putting buttressing in at the tailings dam there, and that will flow through in their budgets. And also one of the very significant considerations at PV is around how that new tailings dam is going to meet the requirements of this standard. So it's certainly, as Tom said, we're not Robinson Crusoe. And my comments at Denver Gold were encouraging and challenging investment community to ask the questions of the mining companies about what they're doing to comply with this standard, because we -- it should be more transparent, and we should be being held to account as a mining industry, and we should be getting asked more questions than we are today.
Anita Soni: I’ll leave at that. Thanks.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Anita.
Anita Soni: That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Parkin of National Bank.
Mike Parkin: Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. Just really one left. Can you comment in terms of your new neighbors in [indiscernible] partnering on San Nicolas. Was that something that interested you or the fact that it's primarily a base metal project, it was not of interest to you.
Tom Palmer: It was something that we were aware of, Mike, but it probably didn't hit our radar in terms of what we already had in our organic pipeline. It was probably a little bit on the small side for us as we thought about -- and for us, it's about how do we look at that opportunity and challenged you in terms of further diversification, but we've got a polymetallic mine at Penasquito, but it's more about -- if we're going to put management bandwidth into Mexico, then I would prefer us to have a single-minded focus on our exploration program to find the elephants that we believe sit under cover in and around Penasquito. There is no way that the Penasco and Chile Colorado deposits are the only deposits that are sitting there, they will discover because they're outcropping. And I'd rather have our team laser focused on the exploration program on our existing leases rather than be distracted by something that's a smaller show next door. I think it's a great combination, though, they can’t take two companies that we're partners with in different projects. And I think it's a great partnership, and hopefully they can do something with them.
Mike Parkin: And just on that regional exploration at Penasquito, it was a while ago that we were down at Penasquito, just pretty much on the onset of COVID. And you were talking about implementation of your proprietary technology for like deep cover discovery. Can you just give us a bit of an update in terms of where things are, where we could expect an update on that?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Mike. We -- I remember that trip well, because the world was closing around us as we were all trying to fly home from Penasquito. But I'll get Rob to maybe give a bit of color on that, it's called Deep Sensing Geochemistry where we've got some proprietary technology for seeing trace elements in soil samples to direct our exploration efforts.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks for the question, Mike. And certainly, going back to what Tom said before, we are applying significant effort and significant resources down at Penasquito to not only do that type of sampling work, but also in terms of really chasing down our target areas. We've done substantial drilling in and around Cedros. You may remember that when we visited, we just struck an agreement with the local community to allow us access. So, that drilling is proceeding well. And we've also been doing some diamond drilling further afield. In terms of the DGS, what we are having to do on those kind of wide open plains, there's a lot of contamination as some of the material has been washed down from the ridges. So, we're just having to punch in fairly short hauls about 30 meters down to the rock, so that we can then do the sampling there that typically we do on the surface. So, it is proceeding well. We've got access in a number of the areas that we need to be in. And certainly, in terms of our budget next year, we're going to have six, seven rigs working down there at any point in time. But we are using every possible source of information, whether it's a DGS technique, whether it's the typical drilling, whether it's prior knowledge or whether it's other radiometric surveying, et cetera. So, again, it's something which we'll be able to provide updates as we pull that information together as we do more and more drilling. But the one thing I'd certainly reassure you is that there is a huge amount of effort going on down there.
Mike Parkin: Look forward to further updates. Thanks very much guys. That’s it for me.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question for today comes from John Tumazos of Very Independent Research.
John Tumazos: Thank you for your patience. With cost of sales up about $229 from the fourth quarter 2020, should we assume other things held constant, like exploration results that you need to raise your gold price from $1, 200 to $1,400 to stay even? First question. And second, with the Panjin gold prices to the mid-$1,600s, does that undermine the basis for raising the gold price from $1,200 for reserves in which case you raise our cutoff grades or take a few reserves out?
Tom Palmer: Thanks John, and good morning. We're certainly seeing -- in answering Anita's question, seeing our costs increase as we look into next year up to the $1,200 mark. I don't accept that they are all structural, some will be. And I think we are working hard on cost and productivity improvements to get on top of some of those costs. So, I think there's work for us to wash through some of that and to have a little less volatility in the world. So, ultimately, what that cost base runs out at, it's going to be higher than where we have been, but maybe not as high as where we're seeing now. When we debate and look at reserve pricing, it's less around the cost base that our business is at and more around looking at the macroeconomics of gold and where do we see a floor in the gold price over the long run. And as we have triangulated a whole bunch of different analysis, that's where the $1,300 or $1,400 is falling out. And we find it difficult to see a world where it would -- gold price would go much below that. So, we -- that's what's more driving that discussion debate internally around, do we lift our reserve pricing. Now those higher costs that we're seeing at the moment, and we're working to manage, and that led to reserve pricing, we may well find that our reserves and resources are pretty much a wash as we come out the other side. So that is a little bit of insight into how we work through that process. So less about what the costs are doing more about what we see the long-run gold price is doing. And then we work bloody hard on – on understanding managing our costs and controlling what we can control and look to bring them down, make investments back in our business, so that we are always having a base business that has a solid margin to not only our reserve pricing, but where the gold price might be at any point in time.
John Tumazos: Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, John. I think, operator, looks like it might be the last of the questions.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
End of Q&A:
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your time. And please enjoy the rest of your day and week. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont’s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Tom, please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining Newmont’s second quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team. And we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered a solid second quarter as we continue to differentiate ourselves through our leading portfolio of assets and projects, our proven integrated operating model, and our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. And most importantly, our values driven commitment to our purpose of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Underpinned by these key differentiators and guided by our clear and consistent strategy, Newmont remain well positioned to safely manage through the evolving and unprecedented challenges that our industry and the world at large face. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.5 million ounces of gold, an increase of over 150,000 ounces from the first quarter and as expected. In addition, we produced more than 330,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, bringing us to well over 1.8 million gold equivalent ounces for the quarter from our balanced global portfolio. We generated significant operating cash flow of $1 billion and free cash flow of $514 million, an improvement of more than $260 million from the first quarter. With $7.3 billion in total liquidity, we have maintained an investment grade balance sheet with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of three times. Preserving our financial flexibility, whilst we continue to invest in our most profitable organic project and return cash to shareholders. In June, we completed the acquisition of Sumitomo’s interest in Yanacocha, bringing Newmont's ownership in this operation and the exciting sulfides project to 100%. And last week, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.55, maintaining an attractive dividend yield of between 3% and 4% for the last seven consecutive quarters. Set within our established industry leading framework and calibrated at $1,800 gold price, our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of both our portfolio and our operating model to deliver sustainable long term value. In May, we published our second annual climate report, part of the suite of reports and our company's non-financial performance. To address climate change and make a real impact, we will need to leverage Newmont’s leading ESG practices, our integrating operating model and the scale and mine life of our global portfolio. These are all important components not only for creating long-term value, but also for addressing the critical issues that our industry must solve, none more important than the elimination of fatalities. Safety is a core company value, and it is at the very heart of operating any sustainable business. I expect it to be the first consideration before anyone begins work at any Newmont location, ensuring that our workforce returns home safely after each and every shift. We have continued our discipline and dedicated approach to safety, maintaining a clear focus on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. During the second quarter, we completed 155,000 conversations by leaders in the field that were focused on these critical controls. Two years ago, we commissioned mobile technology to gather consistent data globally around these important discussions, which we call critical control verifications. And I'm pleased to say that since then, our leaders have now completed more than 800,000 of these conversations. Over the last three years, Newmont has continued to evolve our approach to safety across our global business, improving our fatality risk management program to ensure it is as effective and as insightful as possible. By combining our learnings from significant potential events and critical control verification data, we are now able to gain a deep understanding of the fatality risks of each operation and importantly, what is needed to be done to reduce these risks. At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations, along with a pipeline of more than 20 organic projects with the scale and mine life to deliver strong long-term results. Newmont will produce more than 6 million ounces of gold each year and almost 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver lead and zinc. Combined, that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces every year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. Among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, nearly 9% of our attributable gold production comes from top tier jurisdictions. Because we firmly believe that where we choose to invest and operate matters. And underpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources, which combined with the gold industry's best organic project pipeline, provides the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. We are in a period of meaningful reinvestment as we continue to advance our near term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory, the development of a Ahafo North in Ghana and the Yanacocha Sulfides project, the next exciting chapter in Newmont’s long and profitable journey in Peru. And in addition to our three near term projects, Newmont has a deep pipeline of longer term projects that represent growth opportunities for later in this decade and beyond. These projects and operations are managed through a proven, integrated operating model with a strong track record of delivering long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Newmont's operating model is built upon the fundamental principle that the whole is worth more than the sum of the individual parts. And it is strongly supported by our full potential continuous improvement program, a program that has been in place for over eight years and is more important today than it has ever been. Our team is taking the lessons learned during the pandemic to address the challenges that our industry faces today, including tight labor markets, inflation and supply chain disruptions. As the world is reacting to these pressures we are actively deploying strategies to reduce our exposure. Our global supply chain team is leveraging our scale and the strong partnerships we have developed over many years with our key suppliers and equipment manufacturers. As the industry leader, we have best in class pricing as well as sophisticated rise and fall formulas built into our long term contracts to reduce both volatility and mitigate logistical constraints in order to prevent disruption in our operations. And whilst we can't talk about specific contracts, several of our major equipment and parts suppliers have recently issued comprehensive price increases for the industry that range from 15% to 30%. However, through the efforts of our global supply chain team, we have negotiated lower price increases, in some cases of only 3% to 5% for the coming year. In addition to this, we are challenging the gold industry by implementing new technology to improve productivity and reduce labor risk, such as our transition last year to a fully autonomous whole truck fleet at Boddington. We are leveraging our full potential program, which has been instrumental in delivering value during these unprecedented times, helping to offset the impacts from current market conditions. And we are utilizing real time data and our global team has subject matter experts to share knowledge and talent across our global portfolio, providing critical insights and driving improved performance that our operating teams simply cannot achieve on their own. It's one of the most tangible examples of this. We have designed and implemented three operational support networks covering our core areas of mining, processing and asset management. These global networks bring together our technical experts from around the world providing 24 hour monitoring, coaching and support through a consistent platform. In the mining industry, we traditionally expect our frontline leaders to obtain their own data and insights as they manage everything involved in safely leading a team of people at the start, during and end of a shift. Through our support networks, we help our leaders by monitoring operational performance and providing insights into the areas that need their attention: saving time; improving focus; and removing the need for so many people at our mind sites. And by offering a more flexible work environment, Newman is able to attract the best talent from within and beyond our industry, creating a more diverse, motivated, and highly skilled team to coach and support not one, but all of our operations. In addition to our dedicated and disciplined approach to cost management, you can also expect that we will remain transparent about what we are experiencing today and what we are anticipating in the future from this unprecedented environment. Over the last eight months, we have observed cost pressures, including the impact from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and increasingly competitive labor market, and the highest global inflation rates our world has seen in nearly 40 years. As a consequence, we are anticipating an additional 7% of cost escalation this year. That is on top of the 5% we had already included in our full-year outlook we established last December. Around 1/3 of this increase is related to labor costs. We are seeing contracted services rates that are more than 10% higher than December last year, driven primarily by strong competition for specialized labor, higher levels of post pandemic accretion resulting in higher demand and the pass-through of higher commodity prices and transportation costs. The next 1/3 of the impact comes from an increase in prices for global commodities and raw materials. We're observing escalation in the range of 20% to 30% for certain items such as cyanide and explosives, which is being driven by the increase in the price of natural gas and the availability of ammonia. As well as an increase in the price of steel that is being used in our grinding media and spare parts. And the final third of the impact is coming from higher fuel and energy costs. As an example, diesel prices have increased by more than $50 per barrel, adding approximately $20 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs compared to our original guidance. I'll now turn it over to Rob and then Nancy for a more detailed look at our operational and financial performance, and they will discuss how our second quarter results have been impacted by the current environment. I will then wrap up with an overview of our outlook for the remainder of this year, as we remain focused on implementing productivity improvements, and offsetting the impacts of these challenging market conditions. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide. Let's dive into our operations and projects starting with Africa. Our team delivered a solid performance in the second quarter due to higher ore grade and tonnes mined in addition to strong mill performance, and the team is working to complete an open pit layback, and we expect stripping to decrease in the third quarter as we begin to reach the ore, and create future optionality for both underground and open pit growth. Ahafo South delivered a strong second quarter performance increasing gold production by more than 25% compared to the first quarter due to improved ore grades, higher underground and open pit ore tonnes mined and steady mill performance. And despite the challenges experienced during the first quarter from supply chain disruptions and global border closures, as a result of COVID, the team continues to successfully ramp up mining rates in the Subika underground, which Tom will discuss later on. We anticipate production at Ahafo to be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year as we continue to increase underground tons through increased development and reach higher grades, positioning Ahafo for a strong finish to the year. And finally, the team continues to progress engineering and procurement for the Ahafo North project. All of the permitting has been completed, and we are encouraged by our recent discussions as we continue the important stakeholder engagement work with local communities, traditional leaders, and regulators to ensure full land access, that it is properly cleared of all structures and quarters. As I have mentioned in previous updates, this will be an important milestone, which will give us the opportunity to update the remaining costs and schedule to develop this prolific ore body, ensuring that we can properly incorporate the impacts from this land access delay. As a consequence of working through this important activity, preliminary capital costs are expected to be approximately 15% higher than our original estimate. And we are anticipating a shift in commercial production from 2024 to mid 2025. We look forward to providing additional detail later this year, as we worked to add profitable production from the best unmined goal deposit in West Africa. And now turning to South America, Cerro Negro delivered another strong performance in the second quarter as a result of steady grade and ongoing improvements to mining rates and mill performance. The team continues to advance the first wave of expansions at Cerro Negro, including the expansion of the Marianas district and the development of the Eastern district to extend existing operations beyond 2030. The development of the San Marcos decline is progressing and we have successfully completed the first blast in the Eastern district in May of this year, an exciting accomplishment as we continue to explore and develop the district potential in Argentina. At Marion, the team delivered a steady performance despite very heavy rainfall in the second quarter, impacting mined sequencing and resulting in lower ore tonnes mined and milled in addition to lower grades. We anticipate higher production in the third and fourth quarter, as the rainy season comes to an end, improving mill performance and reaching higher ore grades in the second half of the year. And finally, Yanacocha continued to deliver solid production during the second quarter accelerating ounces from the re-leaching program and improving recoveries from the use of a richer leaching solution. We anticipate production at Yanacocha to be weighted around 55% to the first half of this year, as a site decreases Orton's mined and placed on the leach pads while we work to develop the first phase of the Sulfide project. Engineering is nearly 60% complete and procurement is around 45% complete with approximately one third of the local contracts already awarded. And as you can see in the picture here, the team is progressing the camp construction and early earth works as planned, ensuring we have in place proper accommodations for our construction workforce and for future mine operations. The project team is preparing for an investment decision in late 2022, and we currently expect capital spend to be around $2.5 billion from the full funds approval date with commercial production in mid-2026. We look forward to providing an update towards the end of the year, and we remain very excited about the opportunity to develop the Sulfide potential at Yanacocha. And now over to North America. Penasquito delivered another solid quarter as higher gold and silver grades helped to offset the impact from planned mill maintenance and higher costs associated with the workforce negotiation announced earlier this month. As part of the newly established profit-sharing agreement, Newmont Penasquito has agreed to pay an uncapped profit sharing bonus up to 10% of profits from the operation, with an expense of $70 million related to 2021 results, adding more than $65 per ounce to North America's second quarter all-in sustaining costs for gold and over $180 per ounce for coal product gold equivalent ounces. For 2022, we expect the profit sharing bonus to add additional costs of around $15 million at an $1,800 gold price, adding approximately $4 per ounce to North America's all-in sustaining costs for gold and $10 per ounce for coal product gold equivalent ounces. We reached this agreement with the workforce of Penasquito without interruption to the site, and we continue to build an aligned and valued relationship with union leadership to support the safe and viable operation of the mine well into the future. Looking ahead, costs are expected to stabilize as gold production from this large polymetallic mine increases in the third quarter due to higher grades delivered from the Penasco pit, whilst coal product grades from silver, lead and zinc begin to decline in the second half of the year as planned due to mine sequencing. Moving to Canada. Productivity and costs continued to be impacted by ongoing challenges stemming from a very competitive labor market. In addition to these challenges, Eleonore experienced COVID-related absenteeism during the second quarter as flight capacity restrictions and strict protocols remained in place to protect the health of our First Nation communities and workforce. Musselwhite and Porcupine both delivered an improved performance compared to the first quarter, increasing ore tonnes mined and processed with Musselwhite delivering its best monthly performance in over 3 years. Productivity and ore grades at both sites are expected to continue improving in the second half of the year as mining in Musselwhite progresses to the north in the PQ deeps area, and Porcupine reaches higher grades from Hoyle and Borden beginning in the third quarter. And finally, at CC&V, the site delivered improved production compared to the first quarter due to higher ore tonnes mined and processed at our leach facilities. And as Tom will discuss later on, the mine is now operating as a leach facility with steady production from optimized work placement and declining per unit costs for the remainder of the year. And now turning to Australia. As mentioned during the first quarter earnings call, the Western Australian border was reopened in early March, resulting in significantly higher case counts, ongoing testing requirements and strict close contact protocols throughout the state. Approximately 1/3 of the Boddington workforce and half of the Tanami workforce tested positive for COVID in the second quarter and high levels of absenteeism from positive cases close contact isolation protocols continues to challenge productivity at both sites. In addition, Australia is experiencing a tightening of the labor market as the competition for skilled workers and contracted services has intensified in recent months. Yet despite these challenges, Boddington delivered a strong second quarter performance. The team reported an increase in gold and copper production of more than 25% compared to the first quarter as higher mill throughput and grade more than offset lower tonnes mined due to inclement weather. Performance from Boddington's fleet of fully autonomous haul trucks continues to improve each quarter. And for the remainder of the year, Boddington will focus on achieving record mill throughput rates and increasing tonnes mined from this cornerstone asset. At Tanami, the site also delivered improved production with an increase of more than 25% compared to the first quarter due to higher ore grades, an increase in tonnes mined and improved mill performance, helping to offset the impacts from higher contracted services costs in a very competitive labor market. With the ongoing challenges of securing specialized labor and contracted services, the team continues to successfully progress the second expansion at Tanami, a project that will extend mine life beyond 2040. Nearly 90% of the project engineering and procurement has been completed protecting the project from a number of inflationary pressures. During the third quarter, the team will complete the reaming of the 1.5 kilometer deep, 5.5-meter wide shaft and the installation of the head frame and hoisting infrastructure, which, as you can see here, is nearly 95% complete. And as I have mentioned in previous updates on this project, this will be an important milestone as we evaluate the remaining schedule and cost to complete the project with the key work remaining involving the concrete lining of this production shaft. This process will also ensure that we properly incorporate the significant impacts from COVID-related restrictions and protocols and the current market conditions for labor and materials. We continue to operate in a very competitive labor market in the Northern Territory with significant demand from mining competitors and infrastructure initiatives throughout Australia. Based on our preliminary view, we expect capital costs to be approximately 25% higher than our prior estimate and a shift in commercial production from 2024 into early 2025. We look forward to providing additional detail later this year, and we remain excited to deliver significant pounds, cost and efficiency improvements at this world-class asset. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Let's start with a look at the financial highlights. Newmont delivered a solid performance in the second quarter with $3.1 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,836 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion and solid free cash flow of $514 million. Our strong cash flow generation allows Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely to our industry-leading dividend framework. Last week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, calibrated at $1,800 per ounce, demonstrating our confidence in our future outlook and our commitment to leading returns. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we're in a period of meaningful reinvestment, an essential component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life. In the second quarter, we invested more than $600 million through capital, exploration and advanced project spend as we continue to progress our near-term projects and invest in our future. In July, we paid $34 million in advanced project spend, part of our initial $100 million commitment to Caterpillar, as we work to develop autonomous battery electric haul trucks for our open pit CC&V and our underground mine at Tanami. Compared to the first quarter, adjusted net income declined more than $0.20 on due to the macroeconomic factors that Tom mentioned earlier, in addition to lower realized metal prices for gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc. We sold 46% of our metal in the month of June at an average gold price of $1,834 per ounce, substantially decreasing our average realized gold price for the quarter compared to the LBMA gold price of $1,871 per ounce. Average realized metal prices were also impacted by $105 million of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on provisionally priced sales due to a sharp decline in metal prices on June 30. These impacts alone resulted in a reduction to net income of approximately $0.19 per share compared to the first quarter, largely offsetting a 12% increase in gold sales volumes due to higher production from our operations in Australia and Africa. In addition, we experienced an increase of approximately $80 million from higher labor and materials costs and nearly $50 million from higher diesel and energy prices compared to the first quarter. And as Rob mentioned, we incurred a $70 million expense in the second quarter related to the Penasquito profit-sharing agreement. These impacts, along with smaller, less meaningful items, resulted in second quarter adjusted net income of $362 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Despite the current market environment, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy: to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects; to maintain financial strength and flexibility in our balance sheet and to continue to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. In the first half of this year, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategy, enhancing our ownership of world-class assets and proven mining jurisdictions through the acquisition of the remaining interest in Yanacocha and the Sulfides project. Maintaining our industry-leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and sustaining a strong balance sheet with $7.3 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving Newmont's financial flexibility with no debt due until 2029. As we look towards the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and creating long-term value for the business and all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom to talk about what to expect for the remainder of 2022.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. And turning to the next slide. During our first quarter earnings call in late April, we provided an update on the impacts to our managed operations as a consequence of safely managing through the Omicron surge over the first 4 months of this year. We also discussed the emerging impacts from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, combined with the ongoing impacts from the global pandemic on labor markets and global supply chains, and as a consequence, input costs. We advised that we are closely monitoring these matters during the second quarter and would provide an update with our Q2 earnings in July. As a consequence of this work, we have decided to update our full year guidance to incorporate the following items. First, as we discussed in our earnings call in April, ramp-up mining rates at our new Subika underground mine at Ahafo South have been impacted by supply chain disruptions that have delayed the delivery of the required production drills and global border closures that have impacted labor availability of the key talent necessary to develop this new mine and train our operators. As also discussed in April, I can now confirm that we are advancing the development of a third production level at Subika, which will add optionality for this mine and minimize future disruptions. We expect first ore from this new third level around the middle of next year. Second, as we discussed in April, with the pending conclusion of our contracts to supply concentrate from Cripple Creek & Victor to Nevada Gold Mines, we stepped back to assess our operating strategy at Cripple Creek & Victor to determine if there was the potential for a simpler, higher-value, longer life, leach-only operation that does not carry the complexity and cost of running a mill to process a relatively small amount of the ore mine. This work has now been completed, and we have made the decision to put the mill into care and maintenance and move to a heap leach-only operation reducing production levels into the second half of this year and beyond as a consequence. Third, as Rob discussed, we continue to be impacted by the ongoing challenges associated with safely managing through the global pandemic. These challenges are particularly pronounced in Canada and Australia where we continue to adhere to strict close contact isolation protocols and test requirements impacting productivity and increasing costs. And finally, as I discussed earlier, the impact on our input costs from escalation in the 3 key areas of labor, material and consumables and fuel and energy. These impacts to our managed; operations have been built into our second half forecast as we work to address the critical global issues we face today and deliver on our updated guidance. So for 2022, we now expect to produce 6 million ounces of gold, which is within our original guidance range, but now incorporates the following changes from the impacts I just described. 80,000 ounces at our Ahafo South operation, 50,000 ounces across our Canadian operations, 40,000 ounces at Cripple Creek & Victor and 30,000 ounces across our Australian operations. The impact from these lower production volumes, coupled with higher input prices from inflationary pressures, has also increased our gold all-in sustaining cost for this year for $1,150 per ounce. We remain within guidance for sustaining capital. However, we anticipate our spend to be weighted around 55% to the second half of this year due to global supply chain delays in the first half and higher input costs. The unprecedented and evolving market environment has also impacted our expectations for development capital since we established our guidance in December last year. As a consequence, we have reduced our estimate for development capital for this year to $1.1 billion, incorporating delays in spending primarily associated with Ahafo and Yanacocha sulfides. In addition, over the next few months, we will pass through the land access milestone for Ahafo North and the completion of Shaft Remy milestone for the Tanami expansion and be in a position to clearly evaluate the remaining cost in schedule to complete both these important projects. Building on the trends that Rob just described, we'll be in a position to provide additional detail on both these projects later this year. As we look ahead, we expect that inflationary pressures and the impacts from a competitive labor market will persist into 2023, resulting in production levels and unit costs that will be similar to this year. We are actively working on our 2023 business plan and look forward to providing you additional detail on our long-term outlook when we deliver our annual guidance in early December. We will continue to be transparent regarding the challenges we are managing as a mining industry, and we remain firmly committed to advancing the initiatives that are most important to our business, including climate change. In May, we published our second annual climate report, providing stakeholders with a more comprehensive understanding of how we manage the impacts of climate change at our operations and projects. We believe that climate change is one of the greatest existential threats to our way of life. And this report outlines Newmont's climate-related risks and opportunities, our strategic planning around various climate change scenarios and the specific actions we are taking to reduce our carbon footprint. In addition to our climate report and our annual sustainability report published in April, we will launch Newmont's inaugural tax transparency report during the third quarter, which will provide an overview of the taxes we paid as part of the value we create in the countries where we operate. In closing, we have a tremendous opportunity to address the challenges of our dynamic and changing world from inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions to climate change and reducing fatalities in the mining industry. Guided by our clear and consistent strategy, we believe that Newmont has the size, scale, leadership and experience to navigate these challenges as we continue into our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining. And we are both ready and excited for what is ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. Thank you, operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Lawson Winder from Bank of America.
Lawson Winder: I wanted to start on the dividend. In light of everything that's happening in terms of cost inflation and as well as your comments and plans to spend quite a bit on capital projects in 2022, '3, '4 and perhaps even beyond during this period of meaningful investment when free cash flow could be sort of pressured by these 2 factors, I mean is the current dividend sustainable? And then secondly, you've commented, Nancy, in the past that the dividend payout levels are assessed each quarter. And I'm curious, when you think about that assessment and you go through that process, is it the yield that you're focusing on or is it the payout ratio?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. I'll pick up and Nancy, if you want to chip in, I'll pass across to you. Lawson, the key aspect of our dividend framework is gold price, and we look back at gold price over an extended period of time, not necessarily any volatility you may see in a particular quarter and look at the gold price over an extended period of time and we sit down and have that discussion with our Board to ultimately decide the dividend that we pay and determine the cash that we've generated and our capacity to pay a dividend. If you look back over a 6-month, 9-month, 12-month period, gold price is averaging around between $1,850 an ounce over that period of time. So it's the gold price, which drives our dividend framework. And then we look at our capacity to pay in terms of a percentage of the free cash flow we're generating based upon that gold price. Nancy, you might want to comment on yields more gold price in Newmont.
Nancy Buese: Yes. It's certainly around gold price and margins much more. We're not solving for a particular deal. I would also indicate, too, we've been on the more conservative side with the 40% payout at 1,800 as we were entering this period of reinvestment. And the other piece I would note was when we put the framework in place several years ago, we started and have continued to enjoy quite high cash balances. And we indicated at that time that, that gives us quite a glide path if prices were to change. So we have a great deal of conservatism built into the framework and the ability to continue to consider and evaluate based on those cash balances and our ongoing outlook.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. To build on that, we also recognize that as a long-term business that we'll reinvest from time to time, you'll have periods of greater reinvestment and lower reinvestment over year-on-year or over a period of time. So we take that long-term view into consideration as we look at the spend profile of development capital.
Lawson Winder: Maybe I would ask it, just one follow-up along the lines of the dividend, which is when you speak of your capital allocation framework, which is reinvest in the business and maintain the balance sheet and then 3 was industry-leading returns. Should we think of it as being 1, 2, 3? So reinvesting first, strong balance sheet second and then sort of if there's capital left over, that then goes into the dividend? Or is there a bit of give and take there, for example, could you sort of delay some of these projects in order to maintain a sort of more competitive dividend?
Nancy Buese: Yes. So the gold that we have is a long-term stability of the business, and that absolutely requires reinvestment in these significant capital projects. So that will continue to be a very high priority for us. And certainly, our investment-grade ratings and our balance sheet stability are also important. So we will endeavor to maintain our margins, so we can deliver on all 3 of those priorities. But certainly, the long-term value of the business is very important to us. So we'll continue to calibrate and balance across all 3 of those imperatives, but I would say reinvestment is certainly quite critical.
Lawson Winder: And then just maybe sort of a conceptual maybe a bit of a longer-term question. But I mean, when you look at the cost pressures that you're facing and particularly the labor difficulties, I mean, does this create an imperative to accelerate your automation program and do what you did at Boddington with a greater number of mines? And to what extent can you accelerate that?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Lawson. Good question. I think technology is clearly part of the lever you have as a mining company to improve productivity and optimally reduce costs. And Rob, you might want to comment. I think we have significantly benefited from having autonomous haulage in place at Boddington, probably less so from the cost pressure at this point in time, a [loss] (ph) and more directly as opposed to the productivity, given what West Australia has seen in terms of the introduction of the virus to that state over the course of the second quarter. But Rob, I think if we had -- still had conventional people operating trucks at Boddington, they would have been quite a significant impact through the second quarter. I think some mining companies who have conventional fleets in Western Australia will have experienced through the second quarter of this year.
Rob Atkinson: Without a doubt, Tom, and the unpredictability of the virus not knowing who's going to turn up each day would have really impacted to have 36 trucks guaranteed running day in, day out has really delivered [Indiscernible] certainty but continued productivity. So it's been a good news to us.
Tom Palmer: And Lawson -- thanks, Robert. Lawson, we actually moved -- we have that's a control room that oversees these fleet of autonomous trucks in the latter part of last year, knowing that borders would eventually open up in Western Australia. We actually built a fall back control room. So on the village on the Boddington mine side, we had several rooms set up from within which you could control the mine of Boddington so that if we did end up with a case of some of the key operators testing positive, they could continue to isolate and manage the mine from the comfort of their room in the village. And so we're well positioned to use technology in this particular instance. But I think it will be a key driver in the mining industry when we think about how we can manage some of the cost and inflationary pressures that we're experiencing in certain jurisdictions.
Lawson Winder: I'm going to ask 1 more. I apologize to my colleagues if I've asked too many questions here, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on buy versus build. Just given the CapEx inflationary pressures here, is there an incentive here to perhaps look at additional M&A opportunities and particularly larger, more meaningful M&A opportunities? And I'll leave it there.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson. And for those waiting in line, we'll stay on the call until with the amount of information we've shared this quarter. We'll stay on the call and work through everyone's question. Lawson, our strategy doesn't change. We are very much focused on running our business and investing back in our business. The best investments you can make here back within the projects that you know very, very well. So that is our main focus, delivering value from that well-managed operations and bringing on and developing our organic project pipeline. But that doesn't mean that our radar isn't turned on. And if an opportunity presented where we could pick up an asset or a portfolio that met Newmont's criteria around size, scale, cost profile and jurisdiction, then we would run the ruler over that. If we felt that we could add more value with that asset or portfolio sitting within our operation. But to be frank, 99% of the people who work at Newmont are focused on delivering value from the portfolio that we are managing today.
Operator: Our second question comes from Fahad Tariq from Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq: First, on the labor shortage that you're seeing, particularly in Australia and Canada. Can you just touch on the steps you are taking to address that shortage going forward?
Tom Palmer: Thanks. I'll kick off, and Rob, you might want to build on both of those countries. So if you think about labor, it's the -- our workforce, the people who are Newmont employees is relatively stable. We're seeing turnover or voluntary attrition that is at higher levels than we've maybe seen in the past towards the high level but still within manageable levels of what we've seen in the past. So the inflationary pressure is really coming from the contracted services or the particular technical expertise that we see. So the labor you need to bring in to do large shutdowns or to repair specialized equipment or to do particular contracted services work. And there's the additional costs that we're starting to see as people bid for work, for the work that we send that way, that is an area that we're watching very carefully. But the area that equally is important to me, if not more important to me, is actually having the people you need to do the work. So we have a scope of work we need to do for our shutdown of a mill that you might take down, say, a couple of times a year. And if we can't get all of the people that you need and how are we thinking about the scope of work to ensure that when we button that mill up and recommission it that we can run reliably until its next shutdown. So there's the cost pressure. But probably more important for me is that ensuring that we get the right people working on the equipment to ensure that it's maintained at the right level. Rob, do you want to build on that in Australia and Canada?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. I'll just give 1 example, Fahad, at the last Bollington shut, we were 260 contracts to shore and literally, we had some companies defaulting on entire packages of work. So that really means that we -- we're spending a lot more time with our contractors and our business partners to make sure that we're aligned with those ones, not only for the short term, but also for the long term and continuing to deepen those relationships. And I think just going back to what Tom said about our own employees is that the value proposition that Newmont offers with the safety aspect or environmental credentials as well as the leadership and the working conditions, that is very, very attractive to many people, both inside our company and outside. So it really is around our contracting partners where we're spending most time and most work to deepen those relationships.
Tom Palmer: Just to build a little more on that, Fahad, in my remarks, I talked about 1 of the measures we've got in place to mitigate some of these inflationary pressures are our operational support networks, one of those is in asset management, which is obviously around how we do our maintenance work. And through that asset management program, we are now looking at our maintenance shutdowns across our 12 managed operations around the globe. And looking at how we can smooth out the timing of those shutdowns and when we do the different scopes of work. So as there are particular specialist skills that are rare around the world, we're ensuring that we're able to balance their use across our various operations to ensure that we mitigate that risk of not having that critical resource available to do important maintenance work.
Fahad Tariq: And just my second question, switching gears to Yanacocha Sulfide. I noticed the CapEx estimate didn't change in this press release. Just curious if that is going to -- if a CapEx review is done quarterly or monthly or if we should expect something as part of the investment decision? And if the CapEx review was done and the estimate wasn't changed, what's different about the dynamic improved versus other parts of the world where you're seeing labor and materials inflation?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Fahad. So where we're at with the Sulfides project is, we’re past through the 50% engineering mark, and which means that’s pretty -- a project of this size – any mining project that’s a significant amount of engineering completed at this stage of a project. We are dropping out the quantities right as we speak through this quarter as we build towards investment decisions and using those quantities to determine both the definitive schedule and the definitive estimate. The key amount of work that -- or material that's still to come with sulfides, if you recall, we've actually ordered a number of long lead time items. So the autoclave shells themselves, specialized steel involved with that, oxygen plants, key electric mill miners and the like. So we have derisked that project because both about cost and schedule by ordering some of those critical components and managing their lead times. So looking forward, there are 2 key components. It's all the -- what we call the bulks or stick still to build a plant and all the steel involved in fabricating the tanks and pipes that you have around this processing facility. So there's the cost of steel by specialists steel and standard steel for that work and labor. Now in the Peruvian context, we'll direct higher labor is something that we've got a lot of control to be able to manage, and it will be a very much a local workforce. So the risk is in the escalations that the world is seeing around the cost of steel. So in giving an indication in this update of $2.5 billion from the point of full funds approval, we are incorporating an early look into some of the escalation we're seeing in steel for that go-forward number from full fund. So there is some consideration for that Fahad as we're right in the middle of doing our definitive estimate and schedule as we speak.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski from BMO Capital Markets.
Tom Palmer: Jackie, are you there?
Operator: Jackie, unfortunately, we are not receiving any audio from you. Can you please make sure that you are unmuted locally.
Tom Palmer: Operator, we'll take the next question. We have Jackie to see where to get that line connected. So let's go to the next caller, and we'll pick Jackie up again.
Operator: Of course. Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson from RBC Capital Markets.
Josh Wolfson: Back to the topic of capital allocation, Tom and Nancy. On the theme of the dividend, the existing policy in place, I think, had talked about $300 gold price increments being the key factor determining what the payout was going to be. And Nancy, I believe you mentioned that there had been some conservatism incorporated in there. We're seeing in the current environment, gold prices come off and still cost inflation be meaningful. So does the current policy still maintain its relevance? Or is there some sort of additional thoughts that we should sort of be thinking about rather than strictly that $300 increment determining payout?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Josh. I might pick up that to the start and Nancy you build on it. I think -- we don't -- our dividend policy is deliberately set up to be stable and robust over the longer term. So although we're seeing some volatility in gold price during the last few weeks, we need to see how that plays out going forward. And I mean there's lots of condoscent authorities that us views on what gold price may do or not do. So we will continue to follow that framework, look back at the gold price over an extended period of time, the cash we've generated and are generating and make judgments within our framework. I think the area that as we look forward in terms of the dividend framework is the debate we're having around what the floor is in the gold price. And then ultimately, what gold price we used for doing our mine planning and for determining our reserves and resources and picking up the conversation we had on last earning calls and conversations we have had since then. So if we were -- we're still midstream in that debate, looking at all of those things. But if we were to lift out the gold price that we use for mine planning and for reserve setting then we would step back and look at our dividend framework and the construct around that floor and the gold price, which will have moved. So I think, Nancy, that's probably the most material thing, Josh, in terms of your question, but you want to build on that?
Nancy Buese: Yes, that's exactly right, Tom. So if you remember back to our framework, we had indicated a dollar-based dividend at $1,200 gold price and through the inflationary pressures and what we are seeing, as Tom indicated, around reserve pricing and everything else, the question becomes what is that floor today. And so what you may end up seeing, and we've still got quite a lot of work to do with a slight shift in the framework, but certainly, we have the ability and we'll retain the ability to pay a dividend into the future.
Josh Wolfson: And then also on the share buyback, I noticed there hasn't been much activity year-to-date and obviously look at the move today. But even before that, prices were pretty much below where the stock was trading throughout 2021 when there was meaningful activity. What's the current thought process on how cash is allocated towards the buyback?
Nancy Buese: Yes. Thanks for the question, and it's one where we continue to evaluate. As we've indicated previously, it's a very opportunistic tool, and so we will use that at certain times. As we've been doing the work over the past quarter to evaluate the impact on inflationary pressures with our capital projects, in particular, we have made the decision to think about where we want to spend our dollars and that's really what's resulted in us holding for the moment. We will continue to evaluate our share price and the use of our cash. But yes, I would consider that to be an opportunistic tool that we will certainly use from time to time. And we do have just a bit under $0.5 billion remaining on the existing program.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank.
Tanya Jakusconek: Can you hear me?
Tom Palmer: Loud and clear. Thank you, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: I have a couple. I'm going to start the first one maybe to Rob. I don't want to figure out what's happening at Tanami Phase 2 because I was quite surprised at the increase in capital to that extent of 25%. That's mainly new projects that are coming in. And so 25% was quite a big number for me and also the slippage of over a year was quite a slippage for me. So I'm trying to understand what exactly is happening there to have that amount of capital increase and slippage when we were quite advanced in that project?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya, I'll pick that up and then pass for Rob for more color. The key milestone with the seeking a production shaft of that deep, so 1.5 kilometers a mile deep and 5.5 miles wide as you get to this point where we now have a hole essentially within weeks away from being open at that width and depth to be able to move down and survey the conditions of the wall all the way down to understand, therefore, the work you have to do in lighting that shaft to do whatever bolting and shop creating have to do and then to come down and do the establishment of the formwork and the installation on the concrete lighting. So we -- it was -- we're always building to this point in time where we will be able to survey the shaft and understand the time and materials required to complete the job. To put it in perspective for everybody on the call, if you've ever seen a skyscraper being built and the lift well going up with normally the branding of where it was building the building, you'll see the lift well going up in sort of a few meters once a week or every few days as they're putting the form work together and lifting that structure up to establish that well for the heart of that building. And you'll notice that, that takes many months to do that. We are about to start that process upside down for this shaft and it's a depth that's equivalent to 3 Empire State buildings that we're heading underground to put the formwork in place but each and every day, we're establishing formwork, pouring concrete, heading it set, moving forward, unpacking moving forward and other steps are into that serious task, and we have stepped back. Now that we have the shaft almost finished, we've done an initial survey. We've got to do the final survey, and then we can sit down with our contracting partners with absolute clarity on the condition of that shaft and the time of materials required over the next 18 to 24 months to line that shaft with concrete and the other supporting infrastructure all the way down. We haven't provided an update on Tanami 2 in terms of cost or schedule since the beginning of last year. So what you're seeing us update or give you a trend, whilst we do that remaining work is an indication now of the time and materials to complete that work with a clearer understanding of what the shaft looks like and a clear understanding of what the inflationary conditions are in the Australian market. So it is today's pricing and therefore, cost and schedule based upon a hole we now have largely open the ground that goes 1.5 kilometers down. So that sorts of increases aren't dissimilar to the escalations that we have seen as an industry, particularly in Australia over that 18-month period. But Rob, did you want to provide any color on top of that?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Thanks, Tanya. And I'll just build off a couple of things that Tom said. In general terms, aside from being at the moment in time where we can really get the specific quantities of what's going to take to line that shaft, the way in which I'd look at the increase is at -- about 60% of that is also due to COVID is -- some of the key factors in that is that half of our project team was based in WA, so actually getting them there. We had that 2 weeks where we had a COVID case at Tanami, where we had to shut down the whole operation, which ended up delaying the project by at least 6 weeks. And then with the absenteeism, labor shortages and logistics as well, that has also caused a significant delay as well as the cost. And I think the final point just to really echo what Tom said is that at the early part of the project, we obviously have engineering that we assume. But it's only now that we've actually done the work you can actually see the geology, the overbreak, the actual specifics. And those engineering amounts or the engineering maturity have changed quite markedly. So whilst to say about 60% of the capital increase is due to COVID, about 25% is really due to the engineering maturity amongst other things. But the last thing I'd certainly see, Tanya, is that, hopefully, you can see in the picture, there is significant work that has been accomplished. It's been done safely during a COVID pandemic. We're very, very proud of what we've achieved. But as Tom said, this is a point in time we're able to assess what have the last 18 months really meant to that project and this is the outcome.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Rob. And Tanya still an absolutely terrific project. This production shaft, the crusher chamber underneath opens up 1 of the great gold resources in the world. So still incredibly excited about this project as we reached this milestone and have a greater clarity on the cost and schedule to bring it home.
Tanya Jakusconek: And maybe just on the other projects, and I know -- I think it was Josh asked about the CapEx at Yanacocha Sulfides. I'm just wondering, you mentioned that you've done the costing as of now, but you still are working on some steel and others. So as we get to December, when you have to make an investment decision on that one, we -- I just want to clarify, we are expecting potentially a further update on that one, including maybe Cerro Negro and Pamour?
Tom Palmer: Why don't I pick up sulfides again, and Rob, just cover off where we're seeing Cerro Negro and Pamour sitting. We have -- as we've looked at some of the inflationary or escalation pressures on steel, in particular, and in providing that sulfides number, the go-forward number of $2.5 billion from full funds is starting to incorporate some early views and trending views as to what that number looks like. We still have to do the definitive estimate, which will actually give us some quoted numbers. But we are starting to incorporate in that number, some of those things in terms of the update this quarter. And Robert, do you want to cover Cerro Negro and Pamour?
Rob Atkinson: Yes, I'll kick off with Pamour, Tanya, is that certainly good work is progressing there at the moment, that as you may remember, a large part of the more project is really about dewatering the current pit. So we're well on track for having all the dewatering installed and mechanically complete by the end of this year. So we actually take it forward to the investment committee in the latter part of this year for the actual layback. And we'll be able to provide the assumptions and the estimate there post that. But the good thing about Pamour is it's certainly progressing well. And certainly, in Cerro Negro, there's a lot of work going on there at the moment. We've got 3 portals, which we're working on and have established. So that's growing great guidance. I mentioned about the first blast as well. So we are working along there quite nicely and certainly, again, from the end of the year, we'll provide updates, but it's really going to be more about progress and perhaps an update in terms of development. We're still looking at $300 million development CapEx for Cerro Negro in total. But again, the key thing I just want to make across is the very good progress that we're making at Cerro Negro, in particular around productivities.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then lastly, just another technical question. How should we think about CC&V going forward from an operational standpoint? I know you gave us guidance of reduction for this year, but I'm just keen on understanding this asset just longer term, how we should be thinking about it?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. I'm going to pick that up again, Rob will build on it. CC&V,moving to focus on open pit mining and heap-leach only. We will be working to have CC&V running as simply as it possibly can as efficiently as it possibly can because it's got a single-minded focus on mining efficiently and stacking on the heap-leach efficiently. And with that focus, we expect that we'll have a mine that's very long life because of that simplicity and that efficiency. Rob, do you want to add?
Rob Atkinson: I think that's the key. For me, Tanya, it’s about how do we strip as much cost out of that operation, in particular, the operating support networks, how do we leverage off that, the proximity to Denver and obviously, the technology that we're working on with Caterpillar. But the key to this is the simple mining, leaching operation and which we are really expecting to give us significantly longer life -- a long-life asset that's an important part of the Newmont portfolio.
Tanya Jakusconek: Is this going to be a 100,000 ounce producer? Is that how I should think about it?
Tom Palmer: No, more than that, Tanya. I think it'd be pushing to get to 200,000, but between 150,000 and 200,000 run as efficiently as it can leading into, as Rob said, that that proximity to the demo is how we're approaching it as opposed to trying to have something that's maybe creating between 200,000 and 250,000 with all of the complexity of trying to produce concentrate and all the bandwidth that gets taken from running a mill for a relatively small part of the value of the operation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni from CIBC.
Anita Soni: I'm just going to ask 1 more question about the dividend and then move down to Yanacocha Sulfides. But on the dividend, Nancy, you mentioned 40% of the -- you're using a 40% and being conservative currently. I'm calculating it nearly like 80%, 90% of your free cash flow for the past few quarters. So I just want to understand when you're -- are we talking about the same basis of where you guys are using your free cash flow for the dividend?
Nancy Buese: Yes. Thanks, Anita. And so how we think about it is we look at our plan period and our forecasting, and we calibrate over the cash, we believe we will generate during our -- for us, it's a 5-year planning period and certainly over the much longer term. And so we -- yes, in terms of our forecasting and our modeling, our view is that we are around still the 40% payout calibration at the $1,800 gold price.
Anita Soni: Okay. So you're factoring in perhaps better outlook rather than what's near term and happening currently?
Nancy Buese: Well, I think you're seeing that. We're investing in our business and investing in our future, and those are the indicated returns from these capital projects from the cash flow they will generate when complete.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then the second question was Yanacocha Sulfides. Just to be clear, how much do you plan on spending this year and that would not be included in the $2.5 billion -- current $2.5 billion estimate, correct?
Tom Palmer: We're thinking -- we're looking at about $300 million to $400 million this year, Tanya, on the project, building up to full funds approval. So there's money we're spending on key critical path items that we're procuring. There's money that we're spending on using local contractors to do some of the early earthworks, which is a critically important part of ensuring that there is meaningful work for the communities in and around Cajamarca and Yanacocha. We are building the construction camp, 4,000 beds, and you still saw that in the photo, how advanced that was. My experience in these mega projects is that they often fall behind in the very early days because they don't have the camp accommodation for your workforce. So derisking the project with the construction of that camp this year. And the fourth key area for that spend is the engineering work that we're doing with Bechtel and Hatch that enables us to derisk the project because of the level of engineering that we have that allows us to then be comprehensive with our definitive estimate and our definitive schedule as we move towards full funds. So those are the 4 key areas that, that $300 million to $400 million is being directed to. And just if you picked it up, we actually, as we thought -- as we've looked through our development capital spend, we have adjusted our overall debt cap for this year down to $1.1 billion.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then my last question is with the outlook in 2024. So I appreciate giving you guys -- giving us this 2023 similar numbers. So I assume that means the $6 million at about $900 cash costs. If we look into 2024, I mean, I think the original with Yanacocha with that -- the half -- the Tanami expansion, that's where you would have seen perhaps an uptick in production, would you expect at this stage 2024 to be similar to 2023 and 2022? Or are there any other areas where you could probably potentially see improvement into 2024 outside of the 2 projects?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Thanks, Anita. Yes, as inevitably, these projects are impacted and affected by experiences over the last couple of years and that timing is pushing out, we'll start to see those ounces come on in '25 rather than '24. So if you look beyond '23 to '24, you're going to see a relatively flat production profile year-on-year as those ounces then kick in in '25 and into '26 and then you've got Yanacocha Sulfides coming beyond that. So 2024 looking pretty consistent through 6 GOs, it's going to be the 7, 7.5 million ounces gold and around about the 6%. And that's really what we're aiming to do is to be a steady producer of gold at or around the 6 to 6.5 million ounces of gold, 7.5 million to 8 million ounces of gold equivalents, all up and '24 being pretty stable, '25 will start to kick up from Tanami, 2.5 and on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur from Raymond James.
Brian MacArthur: Most of them asked, but I just want to follow up a little bit on the provisional pricing. And again, I guess when I comment on this, you realized price to zinc say for $1.08. Given where it closed, it seems awfully low. Did you have a lot of open pounds quarter-over-quarter to just -- you said 46% were settled in June, but even the June price was a lot higher than that. So there seems to be a big back half weighting. So can you just go through how that works again specifically at Penasquito. And the second part of your question then is as towns open now. And where I'm going with this is how much of this is cash versus accounting because all these questions we're writing a bit of cash flow over the last couple of quarters, there seems to be a pretty big base metal influence here that's sort of varying quarter-to-quarter.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And I think it's an important area to unpack in terms of how the quarter played out, but I'll pass across to Nancy and I’ve got Senior Officer available, so I’ve got Daniel Horton, who leads our commercial team and does a lot of those sales. But maybe with you Nancy an answer and then Daniel is available, too.
Nancy Buese: Great to have you chime in, too. So we did have a big change from March to June. And so that's one way to think of it. And then really, our concentrate sales take 3 to 6 months to finalize. So that had a pretty significant impact, and then also our ounces outstanding at the end of Q2. So our mark-to-market adjustments were about $40 million for zinc and $23 million for copper, gold was about $21 million and silver at $15 million. So that was the largest component. But that's really what drove some of those provisional pricing adjustments. Daniel, anything else you'd add?
Daniel Horton : Yes, that's right. And Brian, maybe the only thing else I'd add is the average price in June was around $18.30 per ounce. So it was significantly lower than what you thought for the average for the quarter. And then the other point I'd make too is where gold price is trending right now. Obviously, we could expect another similar adjustment if prices continue to decline in the third quarter.
Brian MacArthur: Sure. And what's -- I mean, you got a lot of sites, but I mean some of those aren't delaying 3 to 6 months What's your general timing lag on that normally for the gold side? Like the base metal side, I can see it can be 3 to 6 months. But what's the general gold rule, too?
Daniel Horton : Yes, Brian. The majority of our gold production comes in the form of dore and that really settles in the near term. So that's not where we're seeing the biggest impact, slight impact to the Peñasquito and Boddington. The new schedule on the concentrate shipments are about 3 to 6 months on settlements. And so they are a longer time frame and Boddington is more on that 3-month time frame. So that's, call it, 20% to 30% of our total production of a concentrate does have a pretty significant impact on the realized price when prices are dropping like we've seen in the recent months.
Brian MacArthur: Makes sense. Now the other thing then, so all this discussion about how you said that, I know everybody focused on the gold price for your gold dividend and you are a gold company. But how do you start to think about this? I mean just this quarter, as you said, you had like $90 million in adjustments from byproducts or whatever. How is that generally thought into your long-term thinking for setting that dividend as well? And over time, you might grow other parts of the business as well.
Nancy Buese: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And we do look at the longer term as we consider it, and as we put the framework in place 2 years ago. So we certainly think about those puts and takes, and we have our long-term economic guidelines that we use, and we do quite a lot of work on a regular basis to look at that forward curve, where is consensus headed and then the impact on our plan. So all of that is baked in, and we do see some pretty significant disconnects from time to time. But I would say, over the long term, the trend line stay very much in alignment with our economic guidelines. So this is -- I would say this was a bit of an unusual quarter in terms of just the way the timing and the pricing aligned. But over the long term, we do sort of see those peaks and valleys flatten out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes from TD Securities.
Greg Barnes: Just a question around the inflationary pressures that you're seeing. Are they peaking now? Or do you sense that what we've seen in the first half of this year is going to continue in the second half of the year?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg. Good question to ask. Everything we're seeing is that at a commodity level, they have peaked and are flattening out. So as we look forward, we're seeing that $20 an ounce that builds into that increase to our all-in sustaining cost that that's pretty flat. Labor, I'd say, is the difficult one, so that's specialized labor. I think there is -- I think globally, the world's been shifted on its axis in terms of what availability of labor and decisions people are making about things. The -- so there's -- give you by way of example, in the Australian context. There's something like $200 billion to $250 billion of infrastructure projects that are on the slate in Australia, typically in around major cities. Look at that specialized labor, by going to fly and fly out for mine site to work on a shutdown or to work on a project or am I going to go and work on this bridge or this freeway extension, I think you're seeing that play out across the world in different places. So I think still a question mark over labor. We've got $20 an ounce built in. I think we -- as best we can predict the year going forward, it's a pretty good estimate. And in fuel and energy, obviously, you got the global impacts on fuel in particular, diesel price. So some instances, I'd say probably commodity is probably best predicted. There's still some volatility and that's where we're going to be leaning into controlling those things that we can control. So the work we're putting into those, as I've described before, our operational support networks to ensure that we are leaning into our global supply chain that we are ensuring that we've got inventories where they need to be, that we're maintaining those inventories. We have moved more to local or regional supply than trying to navigate a global supply network. So there are a number of things we're doing to mitigate the work we've done with suppliers, leading into the relationship we’ve spent years building to ensure that we have got one supply and two price protection. So focusing on those things that we can control in still a volatile world. So it's probably not the most satisfactory answer, but there are some levels of stability, but still some levels of volatility.
Greg Barnes: Okay.
Brian MacArthur: Maybe there is a technical question for Nancy, but I mean we are not alone in this. Why the gold sales always get heavily weighted towards the end of the quarter?
Nancy Buese: I think it's that way with most of the miners, but typically, we will have a gold core scheduled for the last week of the quarter, and we ensure that those get shipped and sold at market. And I think that's very common. We do the same thing at the end of every month. And so that's a very normal cycle for us. But the gold pours are scheduled to really align with closing everything out at the end of the month and ensuring we have time to check -- get sales accomplished and those kinds of things, but that's a very common cycle for us in terms of sales.
Greg Barnes: Yes. And everybody else -- just seems 46% in June alone does seem like a lot?
Nancy Buese: That's quite normal. And also sometimes it has to do with transportation contracts and there have been disruptions in those as well. And so simply just getting the dore to market can be a challenge from time to time. So in this particular quarter, I do also think that had an impact on a bit of the back portion weighting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.
Adam Josephson: Tom, forgive me if you've addressed this in various parts of the call, but you talked about your expectation that gold cost will be flattish next year. And on the one hand, I think you said you've entered into some contracts that embed some degree of inflation next year. On the other, you have the onetime costs in 2Q at Penasquito that won't repeat. And I think others have referenced the fact that many global commodity prices have fallen quite considerably in recent weeks because of expectations about an imminent global recession. How are all those factors weighing into your preliminary thinking that gold cost will be flattish? And how much upside or downside risks do you think there is to that flattish cost next year?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. I think the starting point for us is how we see -- I mean, production is a key driver of our costs. And so seeing that production level year-on-year being at or about the same, maybe a tat better as we see improvement come through. So that's -- that becomes the #1 driver in terms of costs that we see that pretty consistent production. Then we're right in the middle of our business planning process at the moment where we're then looking and debating and discussing what we're seeing in terms of our input costs and how we're seeing the various contracts that we've got playing out in terms of whether it be contracted services label, whether it be our own workforce, whether it be the assumptions you make around diesel in the next year, the assumptions we make around spare parts, the assumptions we make around explosives and cyanide and the contracts that we've got in place with those suppliers. So we've got what's happening in the world in terms of inflation. And then we've got one other things that go to our cost base what have we got -- what are we seeing in terms of those costs in those locations based upon the contracts that we have. And we put all that into our melting part and start to do our planning work, and we're seeing unit cost for next year on a very similar production profile come out at or around the same levels that we're seeing for this year. So in terms of trying to give you some indication as to how '23 is looking compared to '22, where we sit here in July, early on in our planning process with that melting pot that's looking at or around the same number. Nancy, do you want to go on that?
Nancy Buese: Yes. We also have, in the past, continued -- and we'll continue to do so, provide great sensitivity around some of our most critical input costs. So when you think about the free cash flow generated from our operations, you'll be able to really indicate in there if we have another $10 change in diesel price, what impact is that going to have on free cash flow as well as other inputs. So we will continue to provide that transparency and all of that will be a part of our guidance in December once that's updated for 2023. To Tom's point, at this point, it looks quite similar, but we haven't finished all of that work.
Adam Josephson: Just 1 follow-up to that, Tom, before I ask one other question, which is on the labor piece, how sticky do you think that inflation is likely to be? I know you mentioned, Tom, there's some global infrastructure projects happening, which is taking some labor away from you arguably. On the other, there's a school of thought that if the global economy goes into recession, some of those folks who would -- who had stopped flying in and out to mines will perhaps have little choice but to go back to their previous jobs.
Tom Palmer: Thanks. It's -- I think we see it most pronounced across United States, Canada and Australia. And if I look at Canada and Australia, there's some big projects and demand for labor and a diminishing pool for labor into the mining industry. So I would predict that, that would be reasonably sticky at least into 2023 when I look at the markets in which we are operating in those countries. So Rob, and I've got Dean sitting alongside me, who run our supply chain. Rob and Dean, anything you'd add to that?
Unidentified Company Representative : I'd just echo what you said, Tom. I think in those countries, in particular, the sales coming into mining are not flowing as much as in the past that we are relying on the established skill base. And with that increased competition, it would be highly unlikely that those wages, et cetera, would go down. So I completely agree.
Rob Atkinson: And I think saying -- Thanks, Adam.
Adam Josephson: Yes. Okay. Sorry to interrupt, Tom. Just on the production you're expecting flattish gold production this year and next year and it sounds like into '24 as well. And obviously, your peers are experiencing similar bottlenecks in terms of their ability to grow production, just myriad supply chain, labor, COVID difficulties. What do you think -- it's as if no matter how high the gold price is and it's still relatively high by historical standards. The industry just doesn't have the ability to increase production, and that doesn't seem like it's going to change anytime soon. Agree, disagree, any thoughts along those lines?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Adam. Certainly, from a Newmont perspective, as we transformed our business 3 years ago, the strategy is to be able to maintain 6 to 6.5 million ounces of gold each and every year and another 1.5 to 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Although we might have some years, we have some -- as you move to the upper end of that band and other years at the lower end of that band, our strategy is around that consistent delivery of metal over the long term and our focus on reinvesting back in the business is to bring on lower-cost gold ounces and the other metals, but to extend mine life. So when we think about growth, it is much about growth in margins as it is about growth in mine life as opposed to focusing on trying to have growth in ounces. It's margin and mine life. So these projects Tanami, Ahafo North sulfides will bring on lower-cost ounces that will help strengthen our cost base, but they -- more importantly, they extend our mine life and our narrative of being a very reliable, long-life producer of gold at those levels is maintained.
Adam Josephson: Tom, and just one last one for me, Tom, along those lines. In terms of the jurisdictional risks that you and others are dealing with, I mean, there's growing social unrest throughout the world, not just in mining, heavy countries. How is that affecting your thinking about just long-term production planning and your ability to grow production in the future, given the specter of higher taxes, increasing disruptions, et cetera?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Adam. I mean a very important part of our strategy is, as I talked about, it's scale, its cost base, it's mine life and the other key component is where we choose to operate matters. So we pay a lot of time and attention in terms of understanding the jurisdictions that we're in, maintaining and developing relationships with the jurisdictions that we're in, we’ve been in all those jurisdictions for a very long period of time. And if we were to choose to go into a new jurisdiction, we will spend a lot of time and attention on that to ensure that we could operate in those locations for the long term. So every location that we're operating in, we're very comfortable with the relationships that we have and the relationship we can maintain to support our business going forward. And we believe it is a differentiator for Newmont in the gold industry today, our very clear focus on where we choose to operate matters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Parkin from National Bank.
Mike Parkin: You kind of answered my question there on where you're seeing the contractor service labor competition that seems to be largely kind of government-related infrastructure builds. My other question was in terms of concentrate processing, are you seeing any pressures there in terms of that group's ability -- smelters group's ability to process con or the cost process con escalating due to, as you've kind of alluded to, input commodity costs rising? Are you seeing anything on your smelter relationships showing pressures in terms of processing the con?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Just before I pass across that, Daniel is probably best placed to give you some color on that question. But on your -- but on your comment on the first one, certainly, there's government-related infrastructure, which I think will continue to see in some of those jurisdictions even in a recessionary environment. But some of those jurisdictions also have pretty significant demand for mining projects -- mining works and mining projects. So I think there's a couple of dynamics playing out there. Daniel, do you want to talk about the concentrate?
Daniel Horton : Yes, definitely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I think the strategy we use in terms of our customers is long-term in nature. And so while we may see periodic disruptions in our smelting and the smelting costs, the relationships are very strong and very long term. Many of these partners have been with us for decades at our different sites. So not seeing anything that we would flag at this point, and our concentrates, especially for Penasquito are pretty unique material that the smelters are in high demand for. So nothing notable at this point.
Operator: The next question comes from Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research.
Bob Brackett : In terms of the Ahafo North delayed land access, do you have a sense of where those local stakeholder concerns are and how intractable or tractable they are and how maybe slow or how quick they will be to address?
Tom Palmer: Bob, we have very robust relationships with all of the key stakeholders in that process. So there are -- the government plays a key role in all of the various important arms of the government, whether it be the Regional Minister, the EPA, the Mining Minister. It's very, very good relationships with those key stakeholders. The traditional leaders, the Asantehene, the King of the Ashanti is a very important stakeholder in that process, very good relationships with the Asantehene. And then the communities in and around Ahafo North are 5. 5 communities, 5 chiefs of those communities, and we are working very closely with them to work through to a resolution of all of outstanding matters so that we can clear crops and structures and start work. So this process is one of ensuring, and I think it's one of the hallmarks of Newmont and our ESG practices. It's ensuring that we work together with all stakeholders and ensure that we are always aligned together before we move forward. So we don't want to barrel in and start building a mine if we haven't got everybody working together on this project because with 100 years of experience, we know if you don't do that well, you will pay the piper for that in the years ahead. So we don't want to start work until we've got everyone aligned. And I think the work we're doing is progressing very, very well, very pleased with how it's coming together, but we want to make sure that every one of those stakeholders is supportive of this project as we start to break through it. But Rob, do you want to build up on that?
Rob Atkinson: I think the only other thing I'd add, Bob, is that in Ghana, this type of development is critical for economically sustaining the area, the providing jobs and training as well as the other benefits that come to community. So certainly, the vast majority of people absolutely see that, absolutely want it. But the key thing for us is just making sure we've got that full alignment for this last part of gaining access before we actually turn the first saw on the ground. But the support for the economic development is very, very strong in Ghana as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos from Very Independent Research.
John Tumazos: Thanks to the Newmont team for the service and keeping the results this good in a tough time. Is it right to sort of interpret that in terms of the background macros, you're not reacting to the July 25 coefficients, specifically that your expectation of the long run likely normal. And since the balance sheet is so great that if you borrow a little bit for CapEx or to fund the dividend or share buybacks, that's okay with a 0.3 debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And I'm specifically thinking about how difficult it is right now with the gold price falling and the costs having risen 12% and the spot gold market having a bad climate for jewelry demand with disposable incomes and Central Bank purchases or less and the ETFs are selling. And for all we know the euro goes to 50% because a lot of these European governments are broke and the dollar’s inadvertently strong. So you're looking through these things because who knows maybe the Ukraine war ends. And by the way, the dividend is tagged to price, but costs are going the wrong way. And I'm not sure that there's a natural ceiling or floor in the gold market because we don't know what the natural ceiling or floor is for inflation, interest rates, the euro exchange rates, all that stuff, please?
Tom Palmer: Thank you, John. I think you characterized how we think about our business over the long term very nicely. And it's one why we put a lot of time and attention to maintaining a very strong balance sheet that gives us the strength when there's some volatility. But we do take a long-term view and the long-term view, our view on gold price is still robust over the long term. But you characterized our approach quite nicely. Nancy, do you want to build on that?
Nancy Buese: Yes. Thanks, Tom. I would also add, we know that the gold price is cyclical over time. And so our goal is to ensure we're preserving margins at times of high gold price and adding cash to our balance sheet, which is exactly what we've done during this last cycle of rising gold prices, who knows where it's headed today, but that's why we wanted to be in the position that we're in. Very strong production profile for decades to come as well as a lot of cash on hand. So we'll continue to evaluate all those factors, but we truly have engineered the business to navigate through all parts of the cycle.
John Tumazos: So following up the various capital projects to strengthen the company for 5, 10, 20 years from now are paramount?
Tom Palmer: Exactly, John, and I think the strength of our company over the last several years has been a result of the capital investments that we made over the previous 5 years through the cycle. I mean we're investing in Merian at Suriname at the bottom of the cycle back in 2014, '15. So it's taking a long-term view, working through the cycle, ensuring you've always got a robust base and reinvestment in the business so that you can be strong for a very long period of time.
John Tumazos: And congratulations on weathering things as well as you have.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, John. And I think operator, is that it in terms of people?
Operator: Yes, that is correct. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Tom Palmer for any closing remarks. Tom, please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your questions today and for taking the time to sit through our summary of the second quarter, a discussion on where we sit for the remainder part of this year, and please enjoy the rest of your week. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines now.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont’s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Good morning, and thank you for joining Newmont’s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team. And we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered on a challenging first quarter, as our operations and the mining industry as a whole, safely managed through the Omicron surge over the first three months of this year. As we emerge on the other side of this wave, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver solid performance in 2022, leveraging our scale and proven operating model to deliver long-term value from the world's best mining jurisdictions. The strength of our people and stability of our global portfolio, not only allows us to endure our short-term disruptions, it is the foundation of Newmont’s clear and consistent strategy to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Turning to our quarterly results, let's take a look at the highlights. During the first quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million ounces of gold and 350,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. And despite challenges from the Omicron surge and the knock-on impacts from this global pandemic, we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance ranges as we build momentum for a strong second half. I recently visited Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana as well as the Boddington mine in Australia, where I saw firsthand the significant efforts our teams are taking to protect the health and safety of our workforce while continuing to move critical projects forward. With $7.3 billion in total liquidity, we have a net debt to EBITDA ratio 0.3 times, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain and grow the business. We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Ahafo mill, the second inspection at Tanami and Yanacocha Sulfides. Just last week, we announced the acquisition of Sumitomo’s interest in Yanacocha, which will bring Newmont’s ownership in this operation and the exciting sulfides project to 100%. And yesterday, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share set within our established dividend framework and consistent with our last five quarters. Newmont’s core values of safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility are essential to creating long-term value for our investors, most governments, communities and employees. Last week, Newmont launched its 18th annual sustainability report, providing a transparent look at our ESG performance and the issues and metrics that matter most to our stakeholders. And in March, we committed $5 million to provide relief and medical supplies to the millions of people affected by the war in Ukraine. We take pride in being a value-driven organization and our core values are fundamental to how we run our business and where we choose to operate. In line with the geopolitical events and the Omicron surge that have impacted so many around the world, our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining is more relevant today than ever before. During our fourth quarter earnings call in late February, we've provided an update on how the Omicron surge and the lingering effects of the pandemic were affecting our operations and the impacts that our stakeholders could expect in the first quarter. As you can see here on the slide, over the first three months of this year, we saw the largest spike in positive COVID cases at Newmont since the start of pandemic. And this graph only shows positive cases and does not include absenteeism from adhering to close contact isolation protocols. As a rule of thumb, for every positive case identified at site approximately two coworkers were sent home to isolate for a minimum of seven days. In addition, many of our team also needed to take time off to care for sick children and family members, as COVID cases spiked in surrounding communities. Fortunately, due to our very high vaccination status, the severity of any positive cases has remained low. As of today, eight of our 12 managed operations have a fully vaccinated workforce of employee and contractors, positioning us to emerge strongly on the other side of this wave and others that may come. However, as a consequence of managing through the Omicron surge, our operations have been impacted during the first quarter by lower productivity from close contact isolation protocols, supply capacity constraints and various other safety measures. We've also experienced pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and the impacts from various state and national border restrictions. This has affected both labor availability and the delivery of equipment and critical spares. And although, our operations were not directly impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has resulted in new and developing complexities, global supply chains and the input costs. As we described in our guidance webcast last December, we assured that escalation factor in 2022, when we developed our business plan to account for higher inflation expected during this year. During the first quarter, we remain in line with our inflation assumptions, but we are closely monitoring critical commodities and materials such as natural gas and the ammonia used for the production of explosives and cyanide. Although, difficult to predict at this stage, the cost pressures from these new supply chain disruptions may increase our unit cost by another 3% to 5% and toward the high end of our guidance range. We will be closely monitoring [Indiscernible] the second quarter and we'll provide you with an update during our Q2 earnings call in July. On the production front, we are well positioned to land within our guidance, now tracking to land 100,000 ounces below our mid-point for gold. We continue to expect both production and unit cost to improve through the second half with approximately 53% of our production weighted to the back half of the year, driven by Tanami, Ahafo, Cerro Negro and our Canadian operations. And as we have demonstrated since the start of the pandemic, we will continue to be transparent as we can with our updates to the market as we leverage our proven operating model and balanced global portfolio to overcome these mid-term uncontrollable disruptions and deliver on our long-term commitments. At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations along with a pipeline of more than 20 organic projects with the scale and mine life to deliver long-term results. Newmont will produce more than 6 million ounces of gold each year and almost 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, combined that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. And it is important to note that this is attributable production, among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, nearly 90% of this attributable gold production comes from top tier jurisdictions. And with the acquisition of the remaining 5% ownership in Yanacocha is 11 of our 12 managed operations will be 100% owned, ensuring that our stakeholders receive the full benefit from Newmont's clear strategic focus and superior execution. We firmly believe that where we choose to invest and operate matters. We have a disciplined geopolitical risk program that ensures we routinely assess our jurisdictions and our risk tolerance to deliver long-term results from established mining jurisdictions. Underpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources, which combined with the gold industry's best organic project pipeline provides the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. We are entering a period of meaningful reinvestments as we continue to advance our near-term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory, the development of Ahafo mill in Ghana and the Yanacocha Sulfides project, and next exciting chapter in Newmont’s long and profitable history in Peru. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob and then Nancy for a more detailed look at our first quarter performance. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide. Let's dive into the operations and projects starting with Africa. Tom and I had the opportunity to separately visit Ghana recently and we were impressed with the progress of both operations as they continued to advance important growth opportunities in this proven mining industry, including sublevel shrinkage at Subika underground, the Akyem Mine and of course, Ahafo North as indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, Ahafo South saw the challenging start of the year. Besides first quarter performance was impacted by supply chain disruptions and global border closures, impacting labor availability and the delivery of new equipment and critical spares. As an example, last year, the site ordered four new drills for the underground and open pit operations. And we only received the first drill in March this year with delivery of the remaining drills expected sometime in the third quarter, much later in an originally planned. In addition to delay of replacement parts for existing drills, as compounding the situation, creating availability challenges with the equipment that we have on hand today, improve no performance has helped to offset these delays but the impacts from the pandemic have affected our ability to ramp up mining rates in the Subika underground. And as a consequence, we are evaluating rates to improve our mining rates, which may include adding a third production level to access higher rates in late 2022 and into 2023. And we expect to have an update with our quarter two earnings in July. Our team delivered a solid performance in the first quarter due to sustained throughput and strong recoveries. The team continues to progress stripping of the next lay back in the open pit, which will extend mine life by an additional four years and provide future optionality for both underground and open pit growth. And finally, we continue the development of the Ahafo North project, engineering is nearly 90% complete and procurement is 60% complete as we continue to work together with local communities, traditional leaders and regulators to give full land access and convince construction. And just in the last few weeks, Tom and I met separately with key stakeholders and received strong support for this important project. And last week, we also achieved an important milestone with the cabinet in Ghana, formally approving the divestiture of the highway that currently passes through a section of the new mine site. When operations begin, Ahafo North is expected to add approximately 300,000 ounces of gold per year while creating lasting value for host communities through enhanced local sourcing and hiring as we develop this political body. And now turning into Australia, at Boddington and Tanami, we experienced the impact from the Omicron surge in the first quarter as labor availability and close contact isolation protocols impacted the region. In addition, the West Australian border was reopened in early March, leading to an increase in on-site cases, but also allowing our teams, contractors and business partners to move more freely through the country and to Tanami for the first time in many months. At Boddington, we reported lower production compared to the fourth quarter due to plant maintenance and COVID-related absenteeism as we saw our first COVID cases on the site. These impacts were partially offset by improved grades and higher ore tonnes mining from Boddington’s fleet at fully autonomous trucks. The team is diligently working multiple face positions in the circuit to access higher grade ore and we expect tonnes mined in grade to remain strong throughout the year. As we continue to optimize consistency, efficiency and productivity from our autonomous truck fleet, a key component to delivering a strong finish to the year. At Tanami the site delivered a strong performance despite the impacts from the Omicron surge in the first quarter and a very competitive labor market in Australia. The site also delivered lower ore grade than the fourth quarter due to mine sequencing and unplanned maintenance at processing facilities. The team continues to progress the second expansion at Tanami, a project with potential to extend mine life beyond 2040. As you can see here in the photo, the assembly of the head frame is nearing completion, which is an important milestone as we transition from the reaming of the shaft to commencing the shaft lining activities. Nearly 85% of the project engineering and procurement has been completed. And over the coming months, the site will focus on the completion of the head frame installation and commencement of the shaft lining, bringing Tanami that much closer to delivering significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements. And now over to North America, Peñasquito delivered another solid quarter, a strong mill performance that delivered higher co-product production from lead and zinc offset lower gold production. Stripping has continued in both Peñasquito and Chile Colorado pit with lower gold grade and higher ore coming from Chile Colorado in the first quarter. And looking ahead, due to efficient sequencing gold production from this large polymetallic mine is expected to decrease in the second quarter, but increase in the third quarter due to higher grade delivered from the Peñasquito mine. Moving to Canada, our operations in the country as a whole continued to be impacted by ongoing challenges, standing from the global pandemic and a very competitive labor market. As indicated a couple of months ago, the Omicron surge reintroduced flight capacity constraints, testing requirements, and strict close contact isolation protocols. And working closely with the First Nations, we have maintained our stringent protocols and testing regimes, even as restrictions have relaxed. Due to the remote locations, these impacts were particularly pronounced at Musselwhite and Éléonore where both sites delivered lower tonnes mined and process compared to the fourth quarter. As an example, we saw absenteeism rates as high as 15% to 20% during the peak of the Omicron surge in our Canadian operations. And at Musselwhite, we decided to place the site and care maintenance for seven days in February to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and communities. At Porcupine, our ore grade was offset by lower tonnes processed as a result of COVID-related labor absenteeism and mill maintenance. In addition to challenging ground conditions and some ventilation constraints at Hoyle Pond, the site continues to progress the Pamour layback, a project that will extend mining at Porcupine through 2035. Construction for water treatment plant is well underway. The team prepares to dewater the pit in advance towards full funds approval in the second half of this year. And finally, at CC&V a mine required a mill shutdown from a conveyor fire that occurred during the first quarter. With the pending conclusion of our contract to supply concentrate from CC&V to Nevada Gold Mines, we are stepping back to assess our operating strategy at the site to determine if there is the potential for a simpler, higher value, longer life rich only operation that does not carry the complexity and cost of running a mill to process a relatively small amount of ore mine. This work is underway and we expect to have an update with our quarter two earnings in July. Coming to South America. Merian delivered a solid performance despite a very heavy rain and mill maintenance during the first quarter, as the site continues to utilize an ore binding strategy to balance steady grade and strong mill performance. In Yanacocha, record rains resulted in a federal emergency declaration of Peru impacting the site as it continues to deliver leach only production, while we’ve worked to develop the first phase of the Sulfides project, which continues to advance towards an investment decision in late 2022. Engineering is approximately 50% complete and the early earthworks and construction activities continue to progress at site. And once finished the camp will allow the construction workforce to begin ramping up in 2023. And finally, Cerro Negro delivered a strong performance in the first quarter as a result of higher grade mine from Marianas North and Marianas Central and ongoing improvements for productivity, despite disruptions from the Omicron surge. During the first quarter, the team successfully completed the tailings storage facility expansion project, and they continued to progress the first wave of expansions at Cerro Negro, including the development of the Marianas and Eastern districts to extend existing operations beyond 2030. The team is advancing the development of the San Marcos decline. And as you can see in the quarter, the construction of the roads, infrastructure platforms and portal access are all well underway in the Eastern district. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Let’s start with a look at the financial highlights. In the first quarter, Newmont delivered $3 billion in revenue at a real life gold price of $1,892 per ounce, adjusted net income of $546 million or $0.69 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion and solid free cash flow of $252 million, which includes unfavorable working capital movements of $465 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by timing of cash collections and over $420 million of tax payments, largely attributable to 2021. Free cash flow was also impacted by higher capital spend, as Newmont enters a period of significant reinvestment and essential component in growing production, improving margins and extending mine life. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operation was $432 million or $0.54 per share. Adjustments included $0.16 related to a non-cash loss on a pension annuitization settlement, $0.04 primarily related to a loss from the sale of La Zanja as part of the transaction to increase our ownership at Yanacocha. $0.05 related to the unrealized mark to market gains on equity investments, $0.04 related to tax adjustments and evaluation allowance, and $0.04 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.69 per diluted share. In our balanced global portfolio combined with our discipline provides significant leverage to higher gold prices from the largest production base in the world. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. And Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, allowing us to confidently execute our capital allocation priorities and build from our position as the world’s leading gold company. A year and a half ago, Newmont was the first in the gold industry to announce a clear dividend framework with a decisive strategy to provide stable and predictable returns. Yesterday, we declared first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, or $2.20 per share on an annualized basis, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a conservative 40% distribution at incremental free cash. We continue to review our dividend each quarter with our board assessing gold price perform along with our operational and financial outlook over the long-term to determine the payout levels within our dividend framework. Since its introduction 18 months ago, Newmont has returned $2.5 billion to shareholders from dividends, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our ability to maintain financial flexibility, while steadily reinvesting in our future. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and flexibility on our balance sheets and to continue to provide industry leading returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategies, enhancing our ownership of world class asset and improving mining jurisdictions through the acquisition of the remaining interest in Yanacocha and the Sulfides project, maintaining our industry leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and sustaining a strong balance sheet with $7.3 billion in liquidity and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, preserving Newmont’s financial flexibility across price cycles. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and maintaining our position as the world’s leading gold company. With that, I’ll hand it back to Tom on Slide 20.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Newmont have a long history of leading change in our approach to ESG and these practices have been embedded in our culture and strategy and are woven into the very fabric of our company. Last week, Newmont launched its 2021 annual sustainability report. Part of the suite of reports and our company’s ESG practices in the key areas that matter most to our stakeholders, including health, safety and security, human rights, the environment, social acceptance, governance and inclusion and diversity. Some of the highlights from this year’s report include zero work-related fatalities for a third year in a row with our focus on verifying the critical controls that prevent fatalities and coaching frontline leaders to provide visible self leadership. Continuing to put the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce and host communities at the heart of every decision we made and continue to make during this pandemic. A key part of this was adopting the requirement for all of our workforce to be fully vaccinated. With contributions to our Global Community Support Fund, we supported COVID testing facilities, vaccine awareness campaigns and vaccine rollouts in areas near our operations. We established the industry first sustainability linked bond, a bond that holds Newmont to account for meeting our 2030 initial reduction targets, and also to reach gender equality and see leadership bonds by 2030. By linking the interest rate paid to our ESG performance, this represents the next important step in aligning our financial performance with our sustainability performance. And finally, Newmont played an important role in creating economic value, contributing $10.8 billion to our workforce, host communities and jurisdictions through wages of benefits, operating costs, capital spend, royalties and taxes. Next month, we will launch our second annual climate report, which will outline Newmont’s climate related risks and opportunities, our strategic planning and the pathways we are taking to achieve our climate targets. We’ve been disclosing a non-financial performance since 2004, regularly ranking is one of the most transparent companies in the S&P 500 and positioning Newmont as the gold sectors recognized sustainability leader. We understand the strong ESG performance is an indicator of a world run organization, and we will only be successful if we forge and maintain strong partnerships with local communities and demonstrate our ability to mine and matter that protects the environment and creates opportunities for people. In order to address the critical global issues we face today, the mining industry will need leaders to scale mine life, superior cash flow generation, and an unwavering commitment for leading ESG practices. And we believe that Newmont is one of those leaders. We will continue to differentiate ourselves through our clear strategic focus and discipline our unmatched global portfolio of operations and projects and an integrated operating model with a deep edge of experienced leaders. As we continue in our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining. And with that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jackie Przybylowski with BMO Capital Markets. Jackie, your line is now open.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks very much. I think I want to ask a question about your cash flow statement. It looks like you had a pretty high working capital spend in the quarter, and I was wondering if you could give us some color on the reasons for that and what you’re doing with working capital? Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie. Good morning. Nancy, do you want to pick up this. Just passing across to Nancy to pick that question up for you, Jackie.
Nancy Buese: So in working capital really, that was related – sorry, that was related to – working capital changes were related to tax payments made in Q1 that were relatively tied to the income and revenue received in Q4 of 2021. So that was the biggest. We also had some inventory that had not yet been sold as of the end of the quarter. So those were the key drivers.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks, Nancy. And maybe just one other question. Looks like in some of your regions, your CapEx spending, I guess, specifically your development CapEx spending is a little bit below the run rate for the full year guidance. And I guess specifically that is South America and Africa, which makes sense because the major projects there haven’t been green lit yet. But can you give us some color because I’m thinking at least on Yanacocha Sulfides the full fund decision isn’t due until December and I’m thinking it’s probably the same in Africa. Can you give us some color in terms of like what the spending will look like? Do you expect to have pickup and spending before full funds decision is reached? Or should we really expect to see those sort of fourth quarter weighted in terms of the spending?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie. I’ll pick up Yanacocha first. You will see spending pick up ahead of the full funds decision. So the first quarter was certainly the largest in terms of spend that builds up quite considerably. We’ll more than double that spend as we move into the remaining three quarters. So you’ll build through the second quarter the half to half waiting 42% spend in the first half versus 58% spend in the second. So we will be building that spend towards full fund approval at the end of the year for Yanacocha. And you are right, a similar story with Ahafo North. We are spending the money now on engineering and procurement and doing the important work with the regulators and the traditional leaders around getting the areas of land cleared of structures and farms and the like to be able to do the highway diversion, which has just been approved by Cabinet and for us to come in and really start to break ground, which will – which we are expecting will be moving through this quarter to get all that in place. And so as you get – as you really start to build up a workforce and get people on the ground doing the earthworks, you’ll see that spend build for Ahafo North in the second half. So I’d be seeing a similar weighting for Ahafo North in the second half. So if you’re modeling, I’d look at something more like 45%, 55% for H1 versus H2.
Jackie Przybylowski: That’s perfect. That’s all my questions. Thanks very much Tom and Nancy.
Tom Palmer: Okay. Thanks, Jackie.
Operator: Thank you, Jackie. Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson with RBC Capital Markets. Josh, your line is now open.
Josh Wolfson: Great. Thank you very much. Thank you for the additional color on the costs versus, I guess, what the guidance expectations were. I’m wondering that 3% to 5% upside that could take you towards the high end of the guidance range, what does that incorporate? Is that assuming current spot prices continue for the duration of the year or are there other sort of factors at play?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks Josh. I might just talk you through another level of detail in terms of what makes up our operating costs has us looking towards that top end of guidance. And if you are modeling off the back of that, if you think about our unit cost on a gold basis, it’s probably closer to 5% than the 3% as we look across our portfolio on the total metal, it’s somewhere between 3% and 5%. But if you look at the drivers of it, 50% of our spend is labor and that’s contracted labor as well as employees. So what we are seeing starting to come through with contracted services, whether it be specialized labor services or the general labor that you bring in for large maintenance shuts, if we are starting to see both shortage of supply of labor, as well as wage premiums coming into the prices that were being quoted for specialized services or shutdown. Also, for instance, Boddington did one of their major shuts through the first quarter. And we had to actually reduce scope for that shut because you simply couldn’t get the arms and legs to the mine site combination of labor availability in Western Australia and a time of the COVID being released into that community. So you are seeing, if you think about that 3% to 5%, 50% of the operating costs, a lot of it is being driven by what we are starting to see come through for some of that contracted services around our operations globally. And given that the quantity of that money then that 5% is sort of indicative of what we’re seeing flow through. But we want to watch it because it is a moving [feast] (ph). We want to really see how that plays out through the second quarter. And Josh, that will play through to exploration, and that will also flow through to some of the contracts contracted services we’ll bring in for – be bringing in for some of our capital projects. So, we’re watching that carefully. The next 30% is materials and consumables. The real driver in that space is ammonia, which we obviously use for explosives and cyanide. And to an extent, grinding media due to the rising steel prices. We’re seeing increasing pricing, probably, increases of 20% to 30% for our landed cost per cyanide. That’s flowing through to really representing a small proportion of our operating cost, probably less than 3% of our operating costs when you see that impact flow through. What we’re monitoring more carefully on the materials and consumables is what’s happening in the global supply chain. And there’s obviously a higher freight cost, but it’s also monitoring carefully to ensure that we’re getting that cyanide and explosives to our mine sites and actually have those consumables that we need to keep our operations running. So our focus is keeping a wary eye on cost, but more about actively monitoring our supply level for some of those critical materials and consumables. And then the last one, [15%] (ph) is energy and the driver of that’s diesel. We’re [assured] (ph) $6 a barrel, and we’re obviously see prices over $100 a barrel. So that’s flowing through in terms of the operating cost. But Josh, I think what’s going to drive that number will be labor, as we look at our business through the remaining part of the year.
Josh Wolfson: Great. Thank you for that. Maybe, one more question on the topic. There were some disclosures there about supply chain challenges as well as, I guess, earlier comments all provided on some of the challenges in Ghana. Wondering maybe, I had some [Indiscernible] from 2008, 2009 of these years as well. But is this a jurisdiction or kind of localized item on the supply chain for specific areas? Or is it specific components? Or is it across the board?
Tom Palmer: Yes, it’s more specific components, Josh. In the Africa example, it’s getting drills in, but we need both the open pit and underground to the opening up development fronts. And it’s the equipment suppliers. I guess [indiscernible]. You can get a lot of components together, but there are some components that are filled up, which means there are a delay in that equipment coming through. So the African example, it’s drills, which will be impacting the mining industry globally. It’s just particularly a beaker underground, needs drills at a critical time in opening up sublevel shrinkage. So that’s the specific type of equipment and supply chain issues. And then the boarders or the global boarder closures were specifically Western Australia and some of the key resource people that come out of Western Australia to operate some of that key equipment. And so we’ve had some challenges navigating back and forth through some of those border restrictions that are now open. And so we’ve got that flowing. So that is less of an issue, but we’re still seeing those supply chain constraints getting some critical pieces of equipment in order to do the work that we plan to do in our mining operations. Robert, do you want to build on that?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Thanks, Tom. And just to add a little bit more color. As Tom said, it was Ghana really was specifically drilled for the Ahafo North project, we’re receiving our haul trucks, our graders, our water trucks, those are coming through. But as Tom rightly says, it is specific types of gears, specific types of parts. It isn’t everything.
Josh Wolfson: Great. And is there anything else that you can think of beyond on equipment that had that level of tightness? Or is that really kind of number one item that would stand out?
Tom Palmer: I think the type – on the equipment side, that’s the one that’s been a particular issue for us, Josh. I think the area that’s going to be tight, but for supply and costs that we need to monitor, as I indicated earlier, is going to be labor. I think that’s going to be a key driver. And obviously, some of the consumables, just ensuring that we’re managing our – we lead into our global supply chain, those long-term relationships, and we’re monitoring that very, very, very closely. It’s also linked to decisions we’re making to derisk some of our operations. Knowing that this issue is potentially going to be weak, the world and the mining industry for some time, that decision we’re looking at around the deeper underground to drop down and open up a third level and have more headings from which to be able to take ore, is derisking that operation stepping back making investment now to the recent operation to better manage some of this volatility and disruptions coming ahead. So, we’re starting to make decisions that help us manage some of these issues going forward.
Josh Wolfson: Thank you, very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you, Josh. Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Tanya, your line is now open.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. Good morning everyone and thank you for taking my questions. So many, but I’ll keep it just to three, if I could. Just wanted to just come back to the guidance that you provided and thank you for that. I just want to make sure I heard it correctly because there was a little bit of static on the phone. Tom, did you say that we’re looking at 100,000 ounces below 6.2 million for this year?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Good morning, Tanya. Yes, that’s correct. And if I give you a little bit more color on that, about 70 – so it’s 100,000 ounces below the 6.2 million midpoint that we’re starting to see open up. It’s managed operations that I’m referring to that are around about 100,000 ounces. 70% of that will come from Subika Underground and the work we do to step back, drop down, open up that third level and really, I was just commenting with Josh to really derisk that operation as we move forward. I think about 20% will come from Cripple Creek and Victor. As we, again, look to move to that simpler operation, just mining and heap leach and incorporate some of the delays that we’ve seen through both the impact of the Omicron surge through the latter part of last year and the start of this year, plus the very important decision we took to go to fully vaccinated at that site. So, we’ve got some work to do now to get ahead of some of the waste more to open up the ore to get them onto heap-leach pads. And I think the move to a simpler longer life operation will contribute about 20%. And then the remaining 10%, we’ve made up across the three Canadian operations that have been pretty significantly disrupted through the first quarter. So Tanya, around about 100,000 ounces. 70% will be underground 20%, CC&V, about 10% Canadian operations.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And does your guidance – you mentioned the 53 second half and obviously, first half is going to be weaker. Does all of the asset breakdown that you provided in your Q4 numbers still stand? The only one I noticed that was a bit different was Peñasquito. I think guidance had been equally weighted, but I think you mentioned Q2 is going to be weaker. Just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly.
Tom Palmer: That’s correct. You’ll see when you look at gold production, with where we’re mining and kind of see that, you’re going to see a bit of a seesaw through the course of the year. So you’ll see – on gold, you’ll see it dropped in the second quarter. We will then climb again in the third, and it will drop again in the fourth, but it’s about evenly weighted across the two halves with a bit of that seesaw effect. So you’re just seeing the different the different metals come through as we’re mining through the different phases of both mines tenant.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And just my last question on the guidance. I just wanted to see, how have your April performance been in with respect to Omicron like in these jurisdictions? Have you seen an improve in productivity and performance?
Tom Palmer: Certainly coming out the other side, I might just quickly work through the four regions, Tanya. Coming out the other side, certainly in Canada, except for, I’d say, Éléonore, where we are still very strict with our protocols of testing and isolating because of our close connections with the First Nation communities around that mine. So, we have kept some pretty stringent controls in place at early on. But in general, certainly see Canada and in the U.S. Cripple Creek and Victor open up. Ghana is common as in its progressing well. Australia is where – I think Australia, in general, is a wash with the virus at the moment. So April is still being impacted through Tanami and Boddington, but starting to come out the other side of that is the you’re really getting to mill in the communities in around Australia. Peñasquito is solid and pretty solid through Merian [ph], Yanacocha and Cerro Negro in terms of being the other side of the [indiscernible].
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So it looks like you’re coming through it, which is good. And then I’ll leave it to one more question, just if I could. You mentioned that you’re closely monitoring labor and obviously, your consumables. Can I ask about your labor? Do you have any contracts, unit contracts or other that come up for renewal this year that could put more pressure on your costs above and beyond?
Tom Palmer: We’ve got contract negotiations in process currently in Ghana. Mexico scheduled for July, Peru is in process and then Surinam, it’s been delayed, and then we’ve got a number of sites that aren’t covered by collective agreements. So they’re active, but there’s nothing that we’re seeing unusual in terms of how those negotiations are proceeding.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So that’s within your guidance range you’ve assumed. Whatever wage inflation is assumed in your guidance for these contracts.
Tom Palmer: That’s correct, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: And what about your supply – your global supply chain? Do you have any renewals on cyanide and/or other that’s coming through?
Rob Atkinson: No, there’s nothing coming through in the medium term on that front, Tanya. So for that one, it’s more managing the landed cost from the input cost of gas and the logistics costs of getting it to where it needs to go.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And nothing else within the supply chain that has to be renegotiated?
Rob Atkinson: Nothing material, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. I’ll let someone else ask.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Thank you, Tanya. Our next question comes from Lawson Winder with Bank of America. Lawson your line is now open.
Lawson Winder: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Tom, Nancy and Rob as well. Thanks for the update today. If I could maybe just go back to the cost guidance, just one more time and sort of get some very specific clarity on the exposure to fuel. And just to verify that if we were to mark-to-market WTI at $100 per barrel versus your $60 per barrel, and all else sort of stayed within the assumption ranges that you still believe you’d be able to stay within your guidance. Is that correct?
Rob Atkinson: Good morning. Good morning, Lawson, and congratulations on your new role. Yes, when we’re talking about that guidance range, staying within our guidance range but certainly seeing us push towards the top 5%. That is making assumptions around current fuel levels and incorporating that in our costs. And probably, the other piece of information to have at hand, but looking at the Newmont portfolio due to that every $10 per barrel change in oil price, our free cash flow is impacted by $15 million per year. But for every $100 increase in gold price, we generate an additional $400 million of free cash flow. So the revenue side is certainly compensating for the additional cost of diesel or oil. But the assumptions we’re making around current oil prices and as we’re thinking about what oil’s going to do going forward this year, that is being incorporated into that indication we’re giving around the move to the top end of our guidance. But obviously, we want to understand that this world a bit more through this quarter. And as I indicated in our remarks, but we’ll provide a further update with the Q2 earnings.
Lawson Winder: Okay. That’s excellent color. And then on the cyanide costs, typically, cyanide pricing is very regional. So, I’d be curious to know if you’re seeing inflation across all regions? Or are there particular regions where you’re seeing that inflation more than others? And particularly, in reference to the 20% to 30% increases in those prices that you’re seeing?
Tom Palmer: We’re pretty much seeing that across the board, and it’s been driven by what’s happening with the price of natural gas across the board. So it’s a little bit different driver than, I guess, normal because of the circumstances.
Lawson Winder: Okay. That’s great. And then also, if I could follow up on the working capital build. Nancy, you mentioned that the – part of that is inventory build. I’d be curious to what extent might that inventory build be sort of structural or supply chain related? And in that same vein, to what extent might that build unwind through the rest of the year?
Nancy Buese: Yes. That was truly just a quarter-end convention that happens from time to time. So that will release all of those sales that have already taken place into April. And then sometimes, we have a little bit of a buildup at the end of the quarter and sometimes, we don’t. But yes, I wouldn’t think of that as a consistent variable for modeling throughout the year.
Lawson Winder: And so you would expect a typical unwinding?
Nancy Buese: Yes, absolutely.
Lawson Winder: Great. Okay. And then just one final question then. Maybe, just to get your latest thoughts on the buyback. Obviously, I understand you intend to be opportunistic with that. What are the indicators that tell you that it’s a good time to repurchase your shares?
Nancy Buese: Yes. We always look at a myriad of factors, including current valuation, our own forecast, trading amongst our peers and some of those kinds of things. So, we’ll always think about what’s proper value and when is a good time to get out and buy shares. So in the volatility we’re seeing today, we’re certainly just evaluating as we always do. We do continue to use that as a tool at opportunistic times and appreciate that we still have some runway left on that current program.
Lawson Winder: Okay. Excellent. Thank you all very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Lawson.
Operator: Thank you, Lawson. Our next question comes from Greg Barnes with TD Securities. Greg, your line is now open.
Greg Barnes: Thank you. Tom and Rob, I want to talk about supply chain issues and cost pressures across the board. Are you seeing impacts on your capital projects timing and CapEx-wise?
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Greg, I’ll pick that up and maybe, Rob, I’ll throw to you for a little bit more color. So the key capital projects – so maybe, just talk through the three of them, Greg, the three key ones that really drive that development capital spend. Tanami 2, we are certainly seeing impacts on that specialized labor that we will need to line that shaft. And we are now in a matter of a month or two away from having completed the reading of the 1.5 kilometers, the air frame is nearing completion as well. And we set up then for the next couple of years to line that shaft in order to complete it. So getting that specialized labor to site set, ready to go for what is a very specialized job in line in that shaft is key. We have an important milestone as we finish the reaming and that shaft to the pause and understand that program of work, both schedule and cost to fit that out. So I would say in the third quarter in a good position to say, this is what the run to home looks like. There will be some impacts but we’ll have a pretty good view of that within a matter of a couple of months. But it’s more going to be on the specialized labor that we need to get there. That’s going to drive Tanami 2. Greg, I’ll pause on each one. Rob, did you want to build any color on Tanami 2?
Rob Atkinson: I think the only other color Greg is that, we have done 85% in engineering and the procurement, so that just highlights the good planning work and the good supply work that we’ve done. But as Tom said, it really is around that labor availability in particular in Australia. We’re pleased that the borders are open that helps that these are very specialist skills and the rates that we are seeing being creeping up a third of that.
Tom Palmer: And then Ahafo North engineering is 90% complete and procurement 60% [ph] completeness as Rob indicated earlier answer to a question. We’ve got a lot of the key heavy mobile equipment landed in Ghana now. So we are really getting into that, getting the land access. We’re getting into the serious business of breaking ground and starting to do the civil works. And then start to build them, open up the mind build a processing facility. So again for that one getting that clear date where we have unfettered access to that land, which will happen through the second quarter, that’s the important milestone for us to then step back and understand what that schedule looks like to have that equipment that’s there. The engineering gives us more definitive pricing to then have a clear view of that project by schedule and cost. So probably similar timing to Tanami 2 during the third quarter, I think we’ll be in a good position to give an update based upon those two key milestones. Rob, getting there anything you add on Ahafo.
Rob Atkinson: I think the only other one, Greg, that is just a significant milestone that mentioned in my preamble about the road that’s a road that goes through the lease. We’ve got full cabinet approval to move that. So again, in terms of schedule that was a very positive step.
Tom Palmer: And then the third one is Yanacocha Sulfides, I think given what we’re seeing in the world fortuitously the decisions we made that were driven by the pandemic to pause the or to delay the full funds approval, but to continue with committing to – we committed to move forward with 23 major equipment packages and we’ve locked in factory slots and a lot of instances pricing for key pieces of equipment, oxygen plants, mills, electric motors, the autoclave, the core part of the pressure oxidation circuit. The autoclave vessel will actually be on the ground Yanacocha by the end of this year. So we’ve been able to derisk a number of elements of that project by making the decision to commit to some of those packages of work. Engineering is around 50% complete. We’ve got camp construction well advanced. So there’s a bunch of stuff we’re doing to de-risk that project whilst we move towards full funds. And we are working very closely with Bechtel to understand the inflationary pressures around the other things that come with that project as we gear up with both a labor, a construction workforce, and then all of the other pieces that you need to build that facility as we take that engineering, that detailed engineering and work out detailed costs. So that’s important input to the full front decision later this year. Rob, anything add for that?
Rob Atkinson: You covered the majority of it. Well, Tom, I think the only other thing, Greg, this is where you update the construction of the camp continues to go along really well. And obviously that’s key to allow the workforce to come in and start the major construction of the autoclave and the rest of the process plant facilities but that is proceeding very well.
Tom Palmer: Greg, does that give you the sort of color you’re looking for?
Greg Barnes: Yes, that’s exactly it. And so on Yanacocha Sulfides, do you think we’re going to get a Q3 update on what that project looks like as well? Or will that be a more in Q4 early 2023 event?
Tom Palmer: More Q4, Greg, we’ll flick as the engineer say, we’ll flick the line on the engineering in the next month or so drop out, drop out all those detailed schedules. And then you've got quite an extensive piece of work to do basically cost and schedule estimate to build towards the full funds decision. So that’ll consume the third quarter, so it’ll be end of the fourth quarter before you have all of that come together, but certainly the other two projects in the third quarter.
Greg Barnes: Okay. And just to finish off others, the appears talked about CapEx inflation in range of 15% to 20%, is that what you’re seeing or do you think you’ve avoided the worst of that at least on Tanami and Ahafo North?
Tom Palmer: There's certainly elements that the mining industry are talking about in terms of that cost escalation we've been able to avoid because of the procurement we’ve got underway and the engineering that we’ve done and the like. However, so the issue for us is more that the pandemic has impacted the pace at which you can do the work. And so for us, it’s going to be as we actually, as we pause at those milestones and understand the work going forward you – and you look at what the schedule is against what we assumed it to be. For us it’s probably going to be more an issue of the indirect costs that you carry for potentially a longer period of time than you’d assume. So that’s going to be a factor for us and we’ll see elements, I think we’ll see elements for aligning of a shaft and that specialized labor that we’ll have some cost escalation. So sort of jumping around it a bit, Greg, I think there’ll be an element of it. And there’s an element that’s pandemic related, given we were into those projects. I don’t know if Rob, whether you wanted to.
Rob Atkinson: I would just reinforce Greg that the biggest issue, obviously, the cost of labor goes into capital is where all that’s the biggest risk that we’ve got is, I think we’ve been very good with our pre-planning and the decision making around the long lead time items and the advancement of the engineering. But it’s the cost of labor, which is going to provide that risk to the upside. And we’re – as Tom mentioned before, we’re seeing it in particular in Australia, and there’s no doubt that’s something that we’re managing closely and going to have to keep an eye on.
Greg Barnes: I don’t want to believe this, but in terms of the specialized labor costs, can you give an idea of how much it’s going up percentage wise? This is what perhaps you expected, or is it too early to say it?
Tom Palmer: You – Greg, I think given the capital projects we hit those milestones and have those definitive schedules and then costs I think probably better to wait and give you the definitive numbers as they apply to those two projects rather than sort of just throw out a number that’s a bit more generic.
Greg Barnes: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Thank you, Greg. Our next question comes from – go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Just before you move on, we’ll stay on the line until we’re exhausted until everyone’s question, so more than welcome to stay on. But we’ll stay here until everyone’s asked their question. Sorry operator.
Operator: Understood. Thank you. Our next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Fahad, your line is now open.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Thanks. My questions have been answered. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni with CIBC World Markets. Anita, your line is now open.
Anita Soni: Hi, good morning, Tom, Nancy and Rob. So, I just wanted to follow up on Greg’s question, related to CapEx. So like I was looking back through the transcript and previously you guys had said in Q4 that it would be a 55:45 split on capital this year. So what I’m sort of understanding, and what I assumed was that if the spending’s not happening, you only came in at 18%. It’s kind of – it’s moved into the second half of the year now, because that’s the rate of spend. And is it safe to assume that, next because of the rate of spend, because you can’t get the labor or whatever delays that you have that next year and perhaps a year after you might see the budgets go up a little, but because the work has been moved out and as we think about Yanacocha Sulfides, like reasonably, if you’re saying that the timelines might be impacted by this, should we be thinking about perhaps a delay in the startup of Yanacocha Sulfides?
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Anita. Yes, I think, you’re – in terms of that spend profile, I think you’re describing it. Well, I think you’re still going to see that similar weighting first or second half, the nature of these projects that spend will just flow into the following year and the following year, we’ll flow forward into the year after that. So I think it’ll be an element of maybe a bit more spend next year. But I think you’ll also see that it’ll move into 2024 as well. So it’s just that felt like moving forward. Still progressing towards the end of the year, full funds decision for sulfides. And once that full funds decision is taken, camp will be complete. So it’ll have beds for 4,000 people, Bechtel are gearing up. And we basically Bechtel higher the workforce directly for a lot of that work. And so with the assumption we get a full funds decision at the end of the year, we will gear up and start to ramp up into 2023. So I wouldn’t see a delay in us starting to break ground seriously on sulfides [ph].
Anita Soni: Okay. And then the second question is a bit big pictures. I look through all of the assets and operations. For the most part, the grades, like I would’ve thought it was more of an impact on tonnage with Omicron, but there are some assets where grades came in substantially below. And I was just wondering if that, do you expect that to rebound closer to reserve grade, most of the operations, like I name Eleonore as one of them, definitely a team in Ahafo, kind of the recovery rates were actually quite low versus the prior quarter, but that may be a grade weighted decision. And then the last one CC&V that heat bleach, that grade is really low compared to what you had in the prior quarter. So if you could give a little bit of color about grades at some of these operations, that’d be great?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Anita. What I might do is give you a bit of a general overview on that note to get Rob, just to give a bit of a color on some of those operations. But I think it’s we talk about the direct impacts from the pandemic, the Omicron surge in terms of labor availability in a particular quarter and costs and the like. But you’re also seeing what I’d call the indirect impacts where this pandemic has been chronic. And so your mine sequences are different from what they would’ve otherwise been if you were just have unfettered access to run your business as normal. So some of that grade discrepancies is the mine sequence and where you are in a particular month or quarter compared to where you assumed you would be, where certainly as we get the stronger second half of this year, part of that is linked to moving into higher grades. And Rob I don’t know if you wanted to pick up Peñasquito, Cripple Creek & Victor and or indeed more than happy to go offline with you and stick through some of that detail for you as well.
Rob Atkinson: Yes. I think, Tom, you covered the key things I need to just to reinforce what Tom said. We’re not seeing any major great challenges. It truly is the timing that with the challenges through COVID some of our developments go behind. We haven’t had the availability and the stops. And as Tom right said, we’re able to sequence, in particular, those underground mines in Canada that you mentioned. If Peñasquito, there’s nothing major or nothing different that’s happened there. And you’ll certainly see that rebound quite quickly in the coming months. And in CC&V in terms of the heat bleach – the heat bleaches is lower at the moment, but again, as we uncover the fresh or we’ll see that people, each grade raise. So it is around the timing. It is around the sequence. And we can underplay, especially in those underground mining sites that were affected by the Omicron, just the lack of development has impacted, getting to some of the stops at the time we expected, but no major issues. The grade is certainly still in the ground and you’ll see that rebound later in the year.
Anita Soni: Okay. And so, as we look at these assets, if we were trying to compare where you would be, it’s basically the two years culmination of, slightly getting behind on development work on some of these things, so, right.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Up to two years, there’s other operations which have been relatively unaffected, but the worst is up to two years. There’s so much may only be six months.
Anita Soni: All right. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Thank you, Anita. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Adam, your line is now open.
Adam Josephson: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, couple of questions for you on cost, if you don’t mind. So if your gold has ends up being call it 850, 860 this year. Just given the general stickiness of inflation that you and many others are experiencing, how if at all, does that affect your thinking about your gold guidance for next year, which would imply quite a healthy decline and cost per ounce, just amid this highly inflationary environment.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Good morning, Adam. When you look at our yearly cost guidance, we don’t assume any inflation in those numbers. They’re unescalated. So if it was a standard year that we were seeing before this pandemic, we would typically have 2% to 3% escalation with them to get built into that number as we built towards guiding for next year. What we are seeing is unprecedented in terms of what’s playing out in the world with the combination of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. So in terms of what look like next year, I think we’ve got to see more of how a few key events play out this year. What’s going to happen with the pandemic, other supply chains going to settle down is what’s going to play out in Ukraine? And as we start our work actually next week with our key leaders around the business starting to map out our business plan and we build towards in October Board Meeting to approve the plan and then regarding in December. So the coming months are ones in which we will step back, look at what’s happening on a macroeconomic sense. What’s structural, what’s cyclical, what is 2023 looking like? And therefore what are our unit costs going to look like next year? So that’s how and we look at…
Adam Josephson: I appreciate that. Yes. And just relatedly, then you said, you – as you said, this is unprecedented. No one, none of us have seen inflation like this, just drawing on past cycles that you’ve been through. How long would you expect this inflationary cycle to last for, or just, or is there no way to answer that question? Because we’re seeing things that we’ve never seen and consequently drawing on past cycles is almost meaningless in this environment?
Tom Palmer: I think we are in unchartered territories, Adam, and it's – I think you've seen throughout the – in terms of what I'm observing in the mining industry as folks are out reporting a very, very similar commentary, so an unchartered territory. I still, as we look at macroeconomics and after the debate, still see it as more cyclical and a long cycle than structural. But we are in unchartered territories, so I would say that there's some caution.
Adam Josephson: And what have, how long – what has the duration been of those previous inflationary cycles just for you, just roughly speaking?
Tom Palmer: Roughly speaking, a couple of years inflationary cycles, but I'm really drawing on straw here.
Adam Josephson: Yes. No...
Tom Palmer: It's just a circumstance that is unprecedented in modern history.
Adam Josephson: Yes. No, understood. Thank you very much, Tom.
Tom Palmer: Sorry, can’t help you, Adam.
Adam Josephson: No, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Adam. Our next question comes from Mike Parkin with National Bank. Mike, your line is now open.
Mike Parkin: Thanks guys for taking my question. Most have been asked. Just one, on the follow-up in terms of delays and challenges with sourcing equipment. Can you just speak to; is it a function of delays in manufacturing the equipment? Or is it more of a function of securing containers and getting it shipped to site? Can you just get a bit more color in terms of where the underlying delay is situated?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Good morning Mike, the delay for some of that key equipment that drills that have been particularly problematic for us is that is manufacturing. So it's actually getting the drill in the queue and manufacture. So it's the labor availability within those shops, and then having the materials you need to – aggregate those drills and then have them come out the door. So what has Rob is indicating, we've got all of the heavy mobile equipment for a Ahafo North on the ground in Ghana. So although there are challenges with logistics and freight, we can get, from a manufacturer's warehouse to our facilities, albeit with some delays. But the key issue is within the manufacturing shop. Robert, do you want to build on that?
Rob Atkinson: I'd just add a couple of points there, Mike. And I think it's very similar to what you hear in the automobile industry that – we know that the significant delays for new cars, whether the microchips, whether it's capacitors, et cetera. And each one of the equipment manufacturers, they can get some things, but not all things. And they're managing their supply chains very, very carefully. So it's nothing different to what the car manufacturers are seeing. And again, one of the advantages in Newmont is that we are – we have got a global supply chain. We've got excellent relationships with our equipment manufacturers, but it's just staying abreast of their challenges, whether they're from – in China, whether it's from India, et cetera, and those key electrical components, as well as those ones which are manufactured elsewhere.
Mike Parkin: Great. Thanks guys. Really appreciate the color.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you, Mike. Our next question comes from Cleve Rueckert with UBS. Cleve, your line is now open.
Cleve Rueckert: Great. Thanks, and thanks everybody for staying on the line. We appreciate your generosity with the time. I have a couple of questions, and hopefully we can work through pretty quickly. I want to just first ask the inflation question a little bit differently. At what point would you reevaluate the gold price assumed for budgeting? When could you possibly move from $1,200 an ounce?
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Cleve and a very good question. We are actively debating that now. I think it is – we are now seeing, I think, in the same way that we're working our way through the inflation piece as you indicated and as Adam was trying to explore and understand, that inflationary piece is driving gold price. We're now seeing gold price at current levels and as we start to get in amongst our macroeconomics and start to have our internal debate starts to do our business planning work. Where is gold price heading and what does the flow look like for gold price is the debate that is active with us now, and we'll be having that debate over the coming months as we think about whether we're getting into the zone, where it's time to look at resetting the floor for gold price.
Cleve Rueckert: So I guess, just in terms of timing, that sort of – it sounds like it would be a year-end budgeting decision?
Tom Palmer: It's certainly something we are actively debating around, whether it's something we incorporate into our planning processes this year. As you unpack the macroeconomics around gold, you are seeing some fundamental shifts.
Cleve Rueckert: Right. Okay. And then, just following up on the CapEx. Tom, I think you said that Bechtel is doing the Yanacocha work for you. I don't know if you can give us any color. Are those engineering and construction projects being done on a fixed price basis at all? Or is it cost plus? I mean, is there any shared risk on the cost side with your subcontractors?
Tom Palmer: Yes. It's a bit – I might just pass across to Rob who manages the very close relationships with those key EPCM contractors, but – It's a bit variable across the projects, so to speak. It is clear, depending on what we're doing, there's some things that you lock in without a doubt. And we much prefer making sure that we've got things – we've got that confidence in clarity. But we've got other areas such as we've explained before, where the labor costs have gone up, the materials are capped, the manufacturing is capped, but it's the labor costs, which are flexible. So we typically like to have full confidence and full knowledge of what we're planning, but it's a little bit bearable, and depending on the work that we're doing.
Rob Atkinson: The big project, Cleve Yanacocha – our supply chain team and the Bechtel supply chain team are working hand in glove as we understand, obviously, those 2023 key work packages that are out there now. But as we look at all the steel or the application of that steel and the other things to assemble a processing plan working hand in glove in terms of understanding that all those elements, what around the world, what's the status of those workshops and their capacity to take work packages. So there are elements of, as promises variable, but their elements where you actually want to be working hand in glove with that contractor to get the best outcome to deliver the project on time and on budget and deliver the value that you're expecting from it, so – for causes.
Cleve Rueckert: Got it. That's pretty clear. And then just finally, again a little bit unrelated, but I'm just wondering if you're able to kind of adapt your COVID protocols to, I guess, the changing circumstances of the virus. I mean, Tommy, I think you said at the very beginning of the call that the severity of Omicron that you saw in your sites was much lower than the previous variants. I'm just wondering if you're able to adapt the protocols that you use, the protocols that you have in place to varying severity.
Tom Palmer: Thanks. Clearly, a very important decision we took and I think very few other companies have taken, but I'm so glad we took the decision, is to require every person who works at Newmont to be fully vaccinated. We lost 25 colleagues to this virus over the last two and half years. And through the Omicron surge, we had one person hospitalized with an underlying health condition. And you saw the spike in those positive cases and us having made that decision has saved lives. And that is going to put us in good stead going forward for future waves, because we have a workforce that is now highly resilient. So that is going to put us in a good position. Rob, did you want to maybe talk about how we think about managing the ability to open up or tighten up our protocols. And obviously, underlying workforce as fully vaccinated gives us a lot of confidence in decisions we made?
Rob Atkinson: Certainly, Cleve. And it's a great question. We have a COVID committee, which we meet on a regular basis for exactly that. And it's to respond to make sure that as things open up, that we open up the measures that we have. And just as an example, when I was in Ghana a couple of weeks ago. For the last two years, everybody has been wearing masks. Everybody has been sitting separately at lunch. There's no longer the need for masks, there's no longer the need for people to sit separately at dinner and launch, et cetera. And the same is at CC&V. And at Peñasquito, we've got a clear plan in terms of how do we start relaxing those metrics. In Canada as well. We've relaxed at Porcupine. But then, similarly, at the likes of Éléonore because of the First Nation that Tom spoke about, we are making sure that additional precautions are taken to protect those first nations. But similarly, we are constantly monitoring through our health partners, the different variants which are coming up. So we are very able to quickly ramp up those protocols as and when needed. But as – because of the vaccination, it has allowed us to utilize less vehicles because get more people in the vehicles. We can get back to more people in planes. We can get people back on to the buses, et cetera. So we're really responding to where the virus is at. But at all times, we can quickly go back if need be, and it's something that we assess on a very regular basis.
Cleve Rueckert: Very clear. Thanks again for taking the questions. Really appreciated.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Cleve.
Operator: Thank you, Cleve. Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael, your line is now open.
Michael Dudas: Hi, good morning gentlemen and Nancy and you guys have done a perfect job this morning of sharing your thoughts and being very frankly on what's going on in the industry. So my questions are all done and best of luck and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Brian, your line is now open.
Brian MacArthur: Good morning and again thank you for taking all the time today. Most of my questions have been answered on this cost thing, and I think we've been sort off a lot, but can I just be check one thing. We're talking – when you're saying 3% to 5%, if I put it this way, is gross dollars up on the cost base. And where I'm going with this, maybe I guess it's the only silver lining in any of this, when you did your guidance, I mean you used $1.15 for zinc and $3.25 for copper. So we're talking – we're not talking on a per GEO basis or anything here, because you should get a pretty big credit if zinc prices stay where we are and copper prices stay where we are. I mean, is there not a – I mean on a margin basis, at least the $200 million plus offset all of this, still? You're not factoring that in your guidance when you talk 3% to 5% up?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks Brian. You are honing in quite nicely. It is predominantly cost-driven. And if you were to model on all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce, I'd probably use 5%. And I think we will get some benefit as we then come back to our total metal profile with a good another 1.5 million ounces of gold equivalent ounces of how those metal prices play out in terms of how you calculate a GEO that will give you some benefit in the unit costs. And maybe a bit lighter than the 5% as you are quite rightly pointing out.
Brian MacArthur: Great. Thanks very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you, Brian. Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Tanya, your line is now open.
Tanya Jakusconek: Thank you so much for taking my – another question from me. I'm just thinking, as I listen to all of this on costs and – I know at the beginning of the year, when you gave guidance, Tom, in December, you were thinking an embedded 5% within the cost structure. Now, we're looking more at 8% to 10% in the structure. And I'm just kind of thinking, a lot of that what we saw in Q1, we didn't really see the full impacts of the oil price come through the cost structure, I think for most of the companies. And I know that ours is quite low. You've given guidance on $60 a barrel, and it's only a $2 per ounce move or a $10 per barrel move. I'm kind of just wondering, at what point do we get through that $2, like, when are we going to get to actual spot pricing? And when we do, am I looking more at a sensitivity of $6 per ounce or a $10 barrel move? I'm just trying to see, as we work through the hedges and get to full exposure, so I can kind of look into my 2023 numbers. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. You're certainly seeing – what we saw play out in the first quarter was escalation or inflation at the levels that we'd assumed. So it's really, as we sell more of a production story related to the Omicron surge that is around Q1. And we now pivot into more of a cost story and additional inflation as we move into the remaining three quarters of the year. So you're starting to see in this quarter, those higher diesel prices flow through. And just to clarify, we don't hedge any of our oil. So it's spot price that you’ll see flow through in our cost base. So you're certainly seeing that oil price in our costs as we're into the second quarter moving forward.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So that $2 per ounce is a good number to use going forward?
Tom Palmer: Yes. That sounds great.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Thank you, Tanya. There are currently no further questions in queue. [Operator Instructions]
Tom Palmer: I think we might be good to finish up, operator by the looks of it.
Operator: Let's see. Okay. If you would like to close out the Q&A session, we can do that, one moment. This concludes the Q&A answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator and thank you everyone for taking the extra time to work through our call with us today, and please have a lovely weekend. And I look forward to catching up with you on our analyst roundtable in a couple of week’s time. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Good morning, and thank you for joining Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team. And we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered a strong finish to the year and has maintained its position as the world's leading gold company with our unmatched portfolio of operations and projects in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. As we move into our next 100 years of sustainable and responsible mining, Newmont will continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders, and differentiate ourselves through our clear strategic focus, superior operational performance and an unwavering commitment to leading ESG practices. Turning to our highlights for 2021. Newmont continued to operate from a position of strength in 2021, leveraging our scale and mine life to deliver strong ESG operational and financial performance. First and foremost, our focus has remained on protecting the health and well-being of our workforce and local communities as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic. We continue to be recognized for our leading ESG performance, building new pathways to decarbonization and publishing our first climate strategy report. And during the fourth quarter, we safely commissioned the gold industry's first autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington and formed an industry-leading strategic alliance with Caterpillar to achieve zero emissions mining and support Newmont's climate initiatives. We finished the year strongly, meeting our updated full year guidance and producing 6 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,062 per ounce. And in addition, produced 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. These results generated $4.3 billion in cash from continuing operations and $2.6 billion in free cash flow. More than 99% of which is attributable to Newmont and available to execute on our balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities. We refinanced near-term debt with the mining industry's first sustainability-linked bond, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility as we further align our financing strategy with our ESG commitments. In 2021, we returned $1.8 billion through our clear dividend framework and completed $525 million of share repurchases, leading the gold sector in shareholder returns. We also completed the acquisition of GT Gold, continue to advance our most profitable near-term projects. And 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Buenaventura's interest in Yanacocha, increasing Newmont's ownership in one of the largest and most productive gold mines in South America. We have successfully operated in Peru for more than 30 years, and we have a deep knowledge of Yanacocha and the value that it brings to Newmont's stakeholders. Since 1993, Yanacocha has produced nearly 40 million ounces of gold. And similar to our acquisition of GT Gold in British Columbia's Golden Triangle, this transaction is in line with Newmont's strategy of district consolidation, enhancing our ownership of world-class assets in proven mining jurisdictions. Increasing our ownership in Yanacocha also means that Newmont is increasing our stake in the sulfides project, which is the next exciting chapter in Yanacocha's long and profitable history. With a multi-decade mine life from just the first phase, this project will generate profitable production of more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at attractive all-in sustaining costs. Importantly, the metal producing sulfides be approximately 45% gold, 45% copper and 10% silver, substantially increasing Newmont's copper position as the world transitions to a green economy. And looking ahead, we are already evaluating the second and third phases of the sulfides project, which has the potential to both increase production and extend mine life well beyond 2040. We are very fortunate to have had a strong partnership with Buenaventura over several decades and look forward to continuing to work with the people of the Cajamarca region and local agencies to sustainably and responsibly develop the next phases of Yanacocha's long life. Turning now to the strategic value that differentiates our portfolio. Each year, Newmont's portfolio of operations will produce more than 60 ounces of gold, along with nearly 2 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. Combined, that is nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for at least the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations and projects around the globe with the scale and mine life to deliver strong long-term results. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, over 90% of our attributable gold production comes from top-tier jurisdictions. And with the opportunity to acquire the outstanding 5% ownership in Yanacocha, 11 of our 12 managed operations will be 100% owned, ensuring that our stakeholders receive the full benefit from Newmont's clear strategic focus and superior execution. Underpinning our portfolio is a robust foundation of reserves and resources. Including our recent acquisition of an increased interest in Yanacocha, Newmont's reserve base now sits at 96 million ounces of gold and 68 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals, predominantly copper. We also offer substantial upside through a resource base of over 112 million ounces of gold, and a further 112 million gold equivalent ounces from other metals, which includes almost 30 billion pounds of copper.  Through our industry-leading organic project pipeline, we have multiple opportunities to increase copper production through the development of Yanacocha Sulfides, Saddle North, Norte Abierto, Nueva Union and Galore Creek, providing natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating ongoing transition to a new energy economy. Reserve replacement is a long-term process. And as Newmont has done for many years, we develop and implement plans that target replacing our annual depletion on average over time. In 2021, we replaced more than 80% of reserve depletion despite the challenges created by the pandemic. And it is important to note that this does not include the 3 million ounces of gold reserves we just acquired through our purchase of Buenaventura interest in Yanacocha. At Newmont, we firmly believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is critical in combating the spread of the virus and preventing severe illness and death. As you can see in this slide, the vaccination rates at our managed operations exceed national rates in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Last September, we took the important step of deliberately moving towards a position where all of our global workforce will be required to be vaccinated. To support this, Newmont continues to deliver vaccination awareness programs, while also working with local communities and governments to both provide and improve access to the vaccines. And one of the most meaningful contributions that our leaders have made in the fight against COVID-19 is the time that they have spent with their teams, holding individual meetings, answering difficult questions, coordinating facilitated sessions with health professionals and guiding our workforce as they make the important decision to protect themselves and their loved ones. We are very proud of the work we have done and we will continue to be a values-driven organization that makes decisions that prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local communities above all else. Over the first 2 months of this year, the Omicron surge has impacted our operations and the mining industry as a whole. Fortunately, due to our high vaccination status, the severity of any positive cases has been low. Our workforce remains healthy, and we are well positioned as we emerge on the other side of this current search. However, as a consequence of safely managing through this surge, we expect that our production results in the first quarter of 2022 could be impacted by as much as 150,000 ounces. Around 1/3 of that impact is coming from our Canadian operations and Cripple Creek & Victor. It's flight capacity constraints at our fly in, fly out operations and close contact isolation protocols have impacted productivity. Another 1/3 comes from Africa, where we are experiencing COVID-related supply chain disruptions and global border closures, which are impacting the availability of skilled workers from Australia, and the delivery of critical spares and equipment. And the final third comes from our operations in Australia, but we are seeing the impacts of productivity and labor availability as we adhere to interstate border closures and close contact isolation protocols. We are closely monitoring the reopening of the Western Australian border, which is currently planned for March 5. And this may lead to a surge of cases impacting the mining industry in that state. However, the reopening of this border will also allow 1/3 of our team at Tanami who live in Western Australia, to now move freely between work and home for the first time in months. As we near the end of February, we are encouraged to see declining case counts and have reported only 1 hospitalization associated with the Omicron surge. Despite the challenges presented by managing the Omicron surge, we remain on track to end the year within our guidance ranges. We expect the production and unit costs will substantially improve each quarter with approximately 53% of our production weighted to the back half of this year, driven by Boddington, Ahafo, Cerro Negro and our Canadian operations.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob and then Nancy for a more detailed look at our fourth quarter performance. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. To echo what Tom said, the pandemic continues to present challenges across our operations and the mining industry as a whole. I'm very proud of the resilience of our people and our systems and I'd like to recognize the very significant efforts that continue to be applied at all of our operations in order to keep our teams safe and healthy. Turning to the next slide. Let's take a deeper look, starting with Australia. Tanami delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter as higher rates and strong mill performance more than offset impacts to productivity from COVID. And despite a tightening labor market and heightened protocols, the team that added more than 800,000 ounces in reserve additions through drilling. We expect Tanami to remain a solid contributor throughout the year due to steady production and higher grade as we progress our investment in the second expansion at Tanami, a project with the potential to extend mine life beyond 2040. The team continues to advance the construction of the headframe. 80% of the nearly 1 mile deep shaft has now been reamed and more than 80% of the project engineering procurement has been completed, an important step in locking in long lead time materials and limiting exposure to rising costs. At Boddington, we delivered the site's best quarterly performance of 2021. Overcoming challenges encountered during the third quarter and reporting improved production and lower costs as the team reached higher gold and copper grades in the South pit. We expect tonnes mined and grade to further improve starting in the second quarter with 52% of production expected in the second half of the year. And I'm very pleased to announce that the gold industry's first autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington has reached full productivity, increasing ore tonnes mined in the fourth quarter and positioning Boddington to deliver a strong performance this year. Early in 2020, our Newmont team came together with our partners at Caterpillar to plan, construct, test and deploy the gold sector's first fully autonomous haul truck fleet. And despite facing some challenges while fine-tuning this new technology to operate in a deep open pit mine for the first time, the Boddington AHS project was completed on budget and in record time, a major accomplishment for Newmont and the industry as a whole.  Today, our autonomous trucks are operating at parity with a conventional haul truck. And we have a deep pipeline of optimization projects aimed at improving consistency, efficiency and productivity throughout the year. The introduction of this technology allowed the site to replace 41 conventional trucks with 36 autonomous vehicles, resulting in important safety improvements and substantial cost savings over the long term. Already, our AHS fleet has moved over 45 million tonnes of material, and these trucks have traveled more than 1 million kilometers, generating tremendous results so far. Vehicle damage has declined nearly 50% in 2021 compared to 2020 and tire damage decreased 93% from more controlled and efficient haulage. But more importantly, we've reported zero injuries in the mines since going live in October last year. In addition to improving productivity, and autonomous haul fleet is fundamentally safer, removing the exposure to potential vehicle interactions and the risks associated with fatigue.  In November, we took another step forward in the use of technology to improve mining, announcing our revolutionary strategic alliance with Caterpillar to deliver first-of-a-kind battery electric autonomous vehicles at Tanami and CC&V as we make progress towards achieving zero emissions mining. We will look to leverage our team of experts within both Newmont and Caterpillar, along with the lessons that we've learned at Boddington as we continue to implement important improvements to safety and productivity throughout our portfolio, while also building pathways to decarbonization. Shifting to North America. Peñasquito delivered another strong quarter with sustained mill performance and higher gold grade. The site is expected to deliver lower gold production and steady coal product production this year due to the planned sequencing at the Peñasco and the Chile Colorado pit, combined with lower grade and harder ore coming from the Chile Colorado pit. Stripping in the Peñasco pit will continue through 2022, and the site will also begin stripping the next phase of the Chile Colorado pit in the second half of the year. And in the first half of this year, Peñasquito will increase capital spend as the site expands camp facilities, ensuring that our team members have the appropriate privacy and accommodation to get proper rest, as well as improving our ability to manage the spread of any future surges of COVID variants. Turning to our Canadian operations. Éléonore delivered solid fourth quarter results due to improved ore tonnes mined and milled. In addition, the site added more than 800,000 ounces in reserves from drilling and favorable revisions. Musselwhite generated the year's strongest quarterly performance from high-grade mine and improved mill performance in the fourth quarter. And Porcupine delivered consistent fourth quarter results as higher throughput and recovery rates helped to offset less high-grade ore being mined from oil pond. In addition, the site continues to advance the Pamour project, just 10 kilometers from our existing plant infrastructure. This project involves a significant layback of the Pamour pit and will extend mining at Porcupine through 2035. The Pamour pit will need to be dewatered as part of this project and the concrete foundations for the associated water treatment plant have been completed. Study work is progressing as the project prepares for full funds approval in the second half of this year. And finally, at CC&V, the mine continued to experience lower grades and recoveries in the fourth quarter, in addition to lower labor availability due to COVID. Turning to Africa. Akyem delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter from higher grade, sustained throughput and strong recoveries. Akyem has begun stripping the next layback, extending mine life and providing future optionality as we continue to evaluate underground and open pit growth opportunities. Ahafo delivered a strong finish to the year, adding more than 400,000 ounces in reserve additions from drilling and generating a 19% production improvement over the prior quarter due to higher tonnes mined from the Subika open pit, coupled with strong mill performance, which more than offset challenges with labor and equipment availability at our Subika underground operation. These challenges were driven by COVID-related supply chain disruptions and international border closures at a time that we are ramping up sublevel shrinkage at Subika Underground. Consequently, we are expecting production at half or to be weighted around 60% to the second half of this year as we increase underground tonnes and reach higher grade. And finally, in Africa, we continue to advance our Ahafo North project. In the fourth quarter, we received a tailings storage facility and water infrastructure permits from the EPA and we expect to gain full land access later this year as we work together with local communities and regulators to develop this prolific ore body. Now turning to South America. Merian remains a strong performer, delivering higher throughput and steady grade in the fourth quarter, while adding nearly 400,000 ounces in reserve additions primarily from drilling at the Maraba open pit. Production is expected to slightly increase this year as ore grade continues to improve through the first half and the site continues to utilize our ore blending strategy to maintain strong mill performance. Yanacocha continues to deliver leach-only production while we developed the first phase of the sulfides project. Early stage engineering continues to progress as the pandemic allows and accommodation facilities for the construction and full-time workforce are expected to be completed in the first half of the year as the site prepares for an investment decision in late 2022. And finally, productivity and performance continues to improve at Cerro Negro as higher ore tonnes mined were partially offset by lower grade in the fourth quarter. We expect production this year to remain in line with 2021, with around 55% weighted toward the second half of the year. Our team continues to advance the San Marcos decline and the first wave of district expansions, which includes the development of the Marianas and Eastern Districts to extend operations beyond 2030 and provide a platform for further exploration and future waves of expansion. The drilling and airport contracts have been put in place, and Cerro Negro added more than 1.1 million ounces to reserves from drilling in the Eastern District, more than offsetting revisions and reinforcing the growth potential in this highly prospective and underexplored gold district. We look forward to bringing you further updates about our progress at Cerro Negro as we bring this project for full funds approval next year.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.
Nancy Buese : Thanks, Rob. Through discrete portfolio and proven operating model, Newmont is able to generate the highest levels of attributable free cash flow in the gold sector. And our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to maintain financial strength and flexibility, while balancing steady reinvestment into our future and industry-leading returns to our shareholders. In 2021, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, ensuring that we are well positioned to sustain our business and continue leading the industry for decades to come. Let's start with a look at the financial highlights. As you can see, Newmont delivered a strong finish to the year. In the fourth quarter, Newmont achieved a record $3.4 billion in revenue, driven by higher sales volumes and strong gold prices; adjusted net income of $624 million or $0.78 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion for the quarter and a record $6 billion for the full year; and strong free cash flow of nearly $900 million for the quarter, an amount entirely attributable to Newmont. Our unmatched cash flow generation enables Newmont to provide superior shareholder returns, largely through our clear and stable dividend framework. This week, we again declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of approximately 3.5% and positioning Newmont among the top 10% in the S&P 500. In addition to our dividend, we continue to execute on our second $1 billion opportunistic share repurchase program, a separate and independent tool that does not impact our dividend payouts. Since December 2019, Newmont has repurchased over $1.5 billion in share buybacks at an average price of less than $49 per share, contributing significant value to shareholders. With an additional $475 million left on the current program, we will look to execute on opportunities over the next 10 months to repurchase our shares. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $61 million or $0.08 per share. Adjustments included $1.10 primarily related to noncash reclamation adjustments at non-operating sections of the Yanacocha site. Based on our ongoing studies of water management and closure activities, the liability was increased by $1.6 billion, of which approximately 1/3 relates to the estimated cost to construct 2 additional water treatment plans over the next 5 years, and the remainder of the increase relates to ongoing closure operating costs, which we estimate include over a period of 50 years. Adjustments also include $0.21 related to the sale of the KCGM Power business and the South Arturo asset exchange with Nevada Gold Mines, $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $0.78 per diluted share. Our balanced global portfolio, combined with our discipline and integrated-operating model, provides significant leverage to higher gold prices from the largest production base in the world. And for every $100 increase in gold prices, above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Nearly 18 months ago, we led the gold industry by announcing our dividend framework, differentiating ourselves with a clear and decisive strategy to provide stable and predictable returns to our shareholders. This framework provides a stable base dividend and returns 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated above a $1,200 gold price. The fourth quarter dividend declared was consistent with the last 4 quarters, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Since introducing our framework, Newmont has returned more than $2 billion through dividends alone, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our commitment to leading returns. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with a clear strategy to reinvest in our business through exploration and organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and optionality in our balance sheet, and to continue to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. Throughout the year, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment into the business with the advancement of our near-term projects and an ongoing commitment to our robust exploration strategy. Delivering the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington, advancing district consolidations with the GT Gold transaction and increasing our ownership in Yanacocha, returning $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share buybacks, issuing the industry's first sustainability linked bond, efficiently refinancing near-term maturities and resulting in no debt due until 2029, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with $8 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2x, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain the business across price cycles. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business and all of our stakeholders.  With that, I'll hand it back to Tom to wrap up.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Over the last year, as we celebrated our 100th anniversary, it has been an important milestone to pause and reflect on our company, our industry and the lessons we have learned. Our clear strategy lays the groundwork to truly differentiate Newmont as we position ourselves to continue leading the gold industry today and well into the future. And as we begin a new year, I am confident that our clear strategic focus, proven operating model, superior execution and leading ESG practices will enable Newmont to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders through sustainable and responsible mining. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq : Thanks for taking my 2 questions. First, Tom, you made a comment about 150,000 fewer ounces in Q1. How should we be thinking about the rest of the year? Will those ounces be made up? Or should we be thinking that this is a net negative to the midpoint guidance for the year?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Fahad. We still expect to be within guidance. So we see opportunities to work to recover some or all of those ounces. Clearly, we're only at the coming to the latter end of February. So plenty of opportunity in front of us. We're going to be weighted to the second half of the year with a couple of our big assets, Ahafo and Boddington in particular. So it's how those have the sequence of those mines shape up and how we move through and the grades it presents. But we certainly see ourselves firmly within guidance for production costs. So 10 months in front of us, plenty of opportunity to work through from the Omicron surge.
Fahad Tariq : Okay. That's clear. And then my second question, we haven't heard much on full potential improvements in 2022. Could you maybe give an overview of any targets or guidance for the year? And whether or not the cash cost guidance that has been provided already incorporates that?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Fahad. So the cash cost guidance does provide for about just under $300 million of full potential improvements, $290 million, across the board. And just to give you a highlight of some of our top initiatives. One of the biggest drivers will be Musselwhite, where we're looking at getting early entry back into the mine after a blast and then increasing the underground shift length. So really basic operational things. We're seeing opportunities around drilling and the rate at which we do the slot raises at Éléonore, that's another significant one. Again Peñasquito is a -- features firmly, looking at just use of availability, use of available time on equipment. You're looking at recoveries within the sulfide plant. You're looking at the augmented feed circuit particularly as we move, that's the front end of the mill, particularly as you move into some of the harder ores coming out of the Chile Colorado pit. So there are some of the top initiatives. We've also just coming out of a refresh at Boddington. And this may represent an example of upside to some of the full potential work that's built into the plan. Boddington was the first site that we implemented full potential back in 2014. So it's been through multiple refreshes over the last 8 years and continues to identify value. The real opportunities as we look into this year and next from Boddington is around the fact that we've now got an autonomous haul fleet. So with the predictability and the controllability of an autonomous haul fleet, there's 2 key areas that we're looking to leverage. One is the speed and the delays around AHS. So it's all about keeping those trucks running and maximizing optimizing their speed. And because they present every time to a shovel at exactly the location you ask it to spot up to, there's a real opportunity and significant value around the queue and hang times at shovels. So some real opportunities going forward at Boddington from a recent refresh that's not included in the outlook that we provided back in December.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. PAUSE
Tanya Jakusconek : Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on ending a strong year and great reserve base. I have a couple of questions. Just if I could start Tom or Rob, on just on the quarterly guidance, so I understand correctly, 53% weighted to the second half. You've given us Boddington half of Cerro Negro, how about the Canadian asset distribution? And how should I think about Peñasquito, another one of your big assets?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Tanya, and good morning. I might start with Peñasquito, I'll then work backwards. So Peñasquito on a gold basis is about 50-50. So pretty consistent through the year when you look at gold. In the Canadian assets, Musselwhite is 60-40 split, very much seeing as a fly-in-fly-out operation at Musselwhite in this first quarter with the Omicron surge you've seen those impacts are weighted to the second half 40-60. The other 2 Canadian sites are around 45-55. If you move into South America, Cerra Negros about 45%, 55%. Boddington in Australia is following the portfolio, 47%, 53%. And Ahafo, and it's particularly driven by 2 things, both Subika related both open pit and underground, we're moving to higher grades in the Subika open pit as we move through that layback and as we start to get equipment and people back moving into the underground and start to get more access to broken stocks, you'll see more material move through from the underground mine. So Ahafo is 40-60. The portfolio at 47-53.
Tanya Jakusconek : Okay. And then the only other one I think you mentioned was Cripple Creek, which is second half weighted?
Tom Palmer : That's right. Cripple Creek is 43-57. So weighted 60-40 through the second half. And that's linked to recoveries coming off the heap leach, so the timing of the grades of gold you place in the recoveries coming through in the second half.
Tanya Jakusconek : That's very, very helpful. And I don't know if Nancy could chime in on the capital distribution, if there's anything we should be aware of on the capital going through the year.
Tom Palmer : I've got it here. So development capital, as we look through the year is sitting at about weighted to the first half, 55-45. So slightly weighted to the first half. And if I look at our sustaining capital, it's about the same, 55-45. So that's a development capital weighted slightly to the first half, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek : All right. So we should see obviously better free cash flow coming out in the second half of the year as we get through the capital and better performance from the assets. That's -- and maybe just going on to some other question. I just wanted to ask about -- I mean, traded about Yanacocha Phase 2 and 3. I don't know from a high level. Tom, if you can kind of give us some concepts of how you're seeing those 2 phases?
Tom Palmer : Yes. Thanks, Tanya. So the Yanacocha sulfides project is -- the bulk of the money is to put in place a concentrator in a lava pressure oxidation facility, which really allows us to open up and be able to process the sulfide ore. And to pay for that investment, we've got the layback in the Yanacocha Verde open pit, which is a lag grade ore we'll put through the concentrator in our first underground mine at Yanacocha Chaquicocha. So it's -- we're punching in off the wall. We already have punching off the high wall of that that pit to start to develop the underground mine. And that mixes with the concentrate and you've got -- you're going to produce, obviously, copper gold and silver coming out of that. 30 years of mining at Yanacocha, we've mined 30 years, 40 million ounces of oxide ore. Just like we saw in Nevada generation ago, sulfide all sits underneath all that oxide ore. So all of those various deposits that we've mined or the vast majority of those various deposits that we mined have sulfide ore underneath the oxides. And so we're -- our drilling programs and our study work is looking at which of those deposits come next in line to feed that processing facility. So that processing facility will process sulfide ore within the existing footprint of Yanacocha for literally decades, like we've seen in Nevada with the roaster at Mill 6. So which of those deposits come through, we're working through, but we have a second phase of deposits, and then we've got a third phase of deposits that we are actively exploring. And we see, as you see with many base metal projects that the opportunity once you've got your facility up and running, and I'm sure we'll see some more ounces come from both the Yanacocha open pit and Chaquicocha underground. That will extend life at existing rates. But then the Phase 2 deposits, there will be opportunity for us to increase throughput as we optimize the processing facility and are able to present ore in different grades and extend life further. So I certainly see the opportunity as we commission this processing facility, second half of this decade, start to see where there's opportunity to creep up in terms of ounces and pounds produced, extending life and then additional deposits coming in to further increase throughput and extend life well into the 2040s and beyond. So hopefully, that gives you some color.
Tanya Jakusconek : Yes. And then is the third phase, the phase that you think about Conga and Caliche or. No?
Tom Palmer : No. The third phase is still existing sulfide deposits in the existing footprint of Yanacocha. So when we think strategically, it's about that foundation of long-term operation, all the things you can then do with the workforce and the communities in and around that operation, then allows you to look very long term as to when does that Conga then come in and when is the Caliche then come in over that long-term time frame. So it's a -- they are upside on top of Phases 2 and 3.
Tanya Jakusconek : Phase 4 then? All right. It’s another phase for you to work on. If I could just 2 other quick ones. I just wanted to understand on the reclamation obligation, understand the one that Yanacocha had a lot to do with water, but may be think about just your overall portfolio in the industry in general. Tom or Rob, should I be thinking that these reclamation obligations, we will start to see some bigger numbers come out of other assets within your portfolio given all of the new legislations going through? Like can you give us any color on what you're seeing in terms of reclamation obligations?
Tom Palmer : Sure. Tanya, it's reclamation obligations dominated by Yanacocha. And it's -- you've got a disturbed area of the 75% the size of the Island of Manhattan. And significant volumes of water with the rain for you have up there. And by the way, the sulfides project doesn't add any additional reclamation. We are essentially working within that existing footprint. That dominates the same discipline we apply at Yanacocha, we apply across our business. So we apply 50 years to our reclamation obligation. So if you've got to treat water as we do at Yanacocha, then we are assuming we're treating that water for 50 years in our assumptions, and we apply today's technology to those assumptions for 50 years. So the opportunity to have a long life operation such as Yanacocha and look for where there's technology to better manage, control and process water represents upside to those numbers. But that -- that is -- that methodology, that discipline is consistent across our portfolio. So -- and it's -- Yanacocha dominates. The next big operation is Peñasquito, which is a significant step down from the Yanacocha obligation and then you're into the Cripple Creek and Victor and the Porcupines and the Boddington. So -- but it's Yanacocha and then daylight Peñasquito and then daylight to those other operations in terms of the closure obligations.
Tanya Jakusconek : We're not seeing anything, Tom, right now, legislation that will make you change anything in your approach for additional money?
Tom Palmer : No. I mean we -- and often, it's about -- it's early the rehabilitation you're doing or it's capturing and treating mine-affected water. And in terms of what we're doing and either the regulation requires that or Newmont requires that, we are treating the water to either drinking water standard or agricultural standard depending on the catchment area for that water that we're discharging.
Operator: The next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets.
Jackie Przybylowski : Just so I want to go back to Yanacocha project just for a moment. On the change to your partnership structure or the acquisition of Buenaventura's stake, now that you own nearly the entire project, does it change your approach at all whether that's timing or anything else? Does it remove any limitations that you may have had with the partnership like maybe one of matures funding capability or anything like that? Or -- just how are you approaching this similarly or differently now versus before you purchase the stake?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Jackie, and no change to the timetable working to -- it's a late '22 approval. It's pretty dominated by ensuring that we can clearly see that the pandemic will allow us to mobilize a workforce. We continue to do early work works. We continue to do the long lead time procurement. We'll have the autoclave vessel on the construction site location by the end of the year as we seek full funds. So that will significantly derisk the project. The other critical path or key item we're working on, which is important for these very large multibillion-dollar projects is to get the engineering to a level where you can have an accurate cost estimate to seek full funds and then derisk the execution of the project. And best practice in mining and oil and gas, the multibillion-dollar project is to get a high level of engineering done. And a lot of our spend this year is on that engineering work with both Bechtel and Hatch. So we'll make sure that we have the pandemic allowing us to mobilize the workforce of 3,000 plus people, the engineering pillar level that allows us to have accurate cost estimates, continue the procurement and late 2022 is the optimum time frame for us to move forward and seek full funds.
Jackie Przybylowski : And you didn't mention anything about the government. There's nothing that you need to see or get assurances on the government side to make a full funds decision. I think I heard you say earlier, you're pretty comfortable, but is there anything on that side that you're waiting for?
Tom Palmer : Nothing we're waiting for, Jackie. If anything, I mean, the government is having a few changes, but the bureaucracy is still working well as it always has in Peru. The government has certainly made signals that if there are any tax changes, if there are any, they would be modest. But we -- and certainly, the way the Congress is playing out, the opportunity for there to be change is diminished. So we look at -- as I was talking through with Tanya, we look at this as a multi-decade investment and we're confident that we can navigate through the current administration to seek full funds approval. So nothing we're waiting for on that front.
Jackie Przybylowski : One other question just on a change of subject, I guess, on the share buyback, I know you pushed back the expiry of your share buyback program. But you've now done over half of $1 billion. Is there any thought to expanding the program to raising the total buyback size, I guess, as you get closer to that $1 billion. Can you maybe just talk about how you think about how much of that you're planning to execute this year and if there is an opportunity to raise that?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Jackie. We certainly look at share buybacks as we have done over the last, as Nancy was talking about in the prepared words. It's our second program, and we've bought back $1.5 billion at less than $49 a share in today's prices, that's a very significant return on investment. So we see it as a tool that is independent to our dividend framework. We believe in talking with our Board that the remaining roughly $500 million in the next 10 months of this year is adequate for us to be able to execute on that aspect of our capital allocation priority, and we will have the discipline as we've demonstrated to only go back in and buy our stock where we see that, that makes good sense. And as we near the end of the year and sit down and talk with our board, we'll see a debate whether it makes sense to think about having another program as we move into 2023. So that will be part of an ongoing discussion with our Board as we look at our different capital allocation priorities. But to answer your question, we think there's ample opportunity with what we've got available to us over the next 10 months to do what we need to do. And we have the cash available to execute on both our dividend framework and on our share buyback.
Operator: Next question comes from Cleve Rueckert of UBS.
Cleve Rueckert : Tom and maybe Rob, I just wanted to come back to the autonomous haulage fleet. I think that Slide 12 that you have laid out there has got some pretty impressive statistics. Maybe you could just tell us, given what you've learned since that's -- that's been ramped up. Are you finding other opportunities to make similar investments across the portfolio? Maybe you can give us a sense of like how much savings it's actually generating in terms of reducing the wear and fewer operators and things like that?
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Cleve. I think that's a terrific question for Rob and he will certainly make sure that he talks about our alliance with Caterpillar and Cripple Creek and Victor and Tanami as well as other things. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson : Thanks, Tom and thanks, Cleve. If I start off with Boddington, certainly, the performance is very, very pleasing. And as I mentioned in the script, we're now performing at the traditional level of the trucks, which is terrific to see in such a short period of time. We have still got an abundance of opportunities, whether it be around the speed, whether it be around the sequencing to the shovels about reducing the hang time, further improving hot seating, further improving refueling, et cetera. So we are continuing to focus on that haul fleet of Boddington to really make sure that it doesn't just match conventional hauling that exceeds it by a long, long way. And with the analytics that we've got, and this is one of the key parts of the partnership with Caterpillar is that we are sharing data like never been shared before, and we're doing that in death analytics. And autonomous haulage is all about improving second by second. And that's the opportunity we've got at Boddington. So I think we're really at the start of a long process, and it's going to be exciting. I look forward to talking about improvements as we go on. In terms of other opportunities, as Tom mentioned, the partnership and the strategic alliance with Caterpillar is incredibly exciting. And the first cab off the rank is going to be at CC&V, and to make that automated. And certainly, we believe that the cost benefits of that will really enhance that operation. Now when we look at autonomous elsewhere, we're obviously looking at Tanami in the underground space, which is going to be key. But also, as we look further ahead, the Pamour project, sublevel shrinkage at Subika. We've spoken about that before. And then at Yanacocha in the underground mines there. So we've got a number of great opportunities to use this absolute proven technology. But again, the key between our relationship is one thing putting in the technology is how you use it and in particular, the data. And that's where the exciting part is, and I think we've still got a long way -- sorry, not a long way to go, but a lot of improvements to come.
Cleve Rueckert : Yes, that's very clear. Just 1 other question I wanted to follow up on the dividend and capital allocation. It's nice to see, I think it was a pretty positive outcome at Yanacocha after, I think, sort of a year, maybe 1.5 years, a little bit of uncertainty. But it does take up Newmont's CapEx obligation at the mine. So I was wondering if that changes at all kind of where you fall in the 40% to 60% band of incremental free cash flow returns. I think, Nancy, you said in your prepared remarks, you're sort of -- you're at the bottom at the 40% at $1,800 gold. I guess does that change at all with more CapEx this year and next year?  And then I guess just to finish it out. In terms of your use of cash, would you be comfortable consuming cash to continue buying back stock? I think the cash balance declined very slightly for the year in 2021. But I mean, I guess, ultimately, how are you thinking about the cash balance as it stands? Would you use more cash to buy back stock? Or do you anticipate being flat at the end of the year?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Cleve. Our dividend framework is predicated on the fact that at our base dividend of $1 a share, we pay for our reinvestment back in the business over the long term. So those projects are profitable and returning assuming gold is at [$1,200] and Yanacocha sulfide has got other metals associated with it. So our dividend framework reinvestment back in the business comes first, and we pay a base dividend of $1 a share. If every $100 increase above that, we're generating that $400 million of free cash flow every year, of which we're returning 40%. So it is robust and independent of the decisions we have made to reinvest back in the business. Nancy, do you want to pick up in terms of our cash balances and how we think about dividends and share buybacks.
Nancy Buese : Yes, exactly, as Tom said, is we can create opportunities on all fronts in terms of reinvestment in the business, the dividend structure and the share buyback. And as we ended the year with over $5 billion in cash on hand and $8 billion of liquidity, we do have the ability to do all of that. And so that's what you'll see us focus on is that reinvestment in the Yanacocha consolidation does not impact those numbers or limit us in any way. And you'll see us continue to work with our Board and evaluate opportunities for the dividend over time. So yes, we are pegged at the $1,800 and 40% right now, we'll always look at opportunities to consider raising that if appropriate.
Cleve Rueckert: Okay. I guess, Nancy, just quickly, does the higher CapEx at Yanacocha change where you are relative to the 40%? Or is it relatively?
Tom Palmer: Cleve, no. Absolutely, no.
Cleve Rueckert: Yes, okay, okay. Very clear. Thank you, guys. 
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Cleve. Operator, I'm conscious that folks on this call will want to get to another call at the top of the hour. So if you maybe just take 1 more and we'll make sure we've got you free and clear at the top of the hour.
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.
Adam Josephson : Congratulations on a really good finish to our year. Tom or Nancy, just on your cost outlook for this year, you mentioned 150,000 ounce production impact you're expecting in the first quarter. Obviously, Brent crude today is at $104 a barrel because of Russia-Ukraine. Are you thinking any differently about your gold CAS or ASIC guidance than you were 2, 3 months ago? And within that, are you thinking about any of the components differently, energy, transport, labor, et cetera?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. I'll pick that one up. In terms of both -- particularly -- there's probably 2 factors associated with what's happening in the Ukraine at the moment. We're certainly seeing oil prices go up. It's a diesel price for us. And natural gas prices are going up and natural gas is used to make ammonia, which is then used to make our explosive ammonium nitrate. Both our energy costs make up around 15% of our operating costs. So operating costs are much more dominated by labor at 50% and materials and consumables, it's about 30%. So it's only 15% of our cost base. And as we looked into this year, understanding the volatility that was ahead of us, the uncertainty around COVID, we had factored in on an aggregated basis, escalation into our guidance. And so some of the things that we're seeing now, we've already accommodated in terms of how we thought about our cost guidance. So as we sit here today, we don't see that -- either the impact of the Omicron surge or some of these near-term events impacting our ability to land within our guided number for all-in sustaining cost per ounce. To give you an idea of sensitivity. For every $100 increase in gold price, we generate $400 million of free cash flow. So you're seeing with the current events gold price well over $1,900, and we guided at an $1,800 gold price. Every $10 increase in the barrel of oil represents only $15 million of free cash flow. So it's a significant difference. And again, if I use the same words I was using with Tanya, there's daylight between the sensitivity to gold price and the sensitivity to a barrel of oil.
Adam Josephson : Thank you for that, Tom. And then just 1 last 1 on the sequencing of costs, you mentioned that cost per ounce will decline for obvious reasons as the year progresses. But would you care to give us any more context in terms of the degree of change by quarter, just in the event that we're perhaps underestimating the 1Q impact of the production loss or any other sequencing that you would have us be mindful of in terms of our cost modeling?
Tom Palmer: The cost will follow closely with those production numbers. So it's very much cost is being driven by production as we look at those trends. So the trends we talk through at a portfolio level and the different assets that we -- we've talked through over the course of the last few minutes, costs will follow that trend. So as production is increasing, the cost will decrease at similar percentages.
Adam Josephson : Thanks very much.
Tom Palmer : Thanks, Adam. I think that's probably it, operator.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for any closing remarks.
Tom Palmer : Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for making the time to the call today, and please look after yourselves and continue to stay safe and healthy. But thank you, everyone, for your time.
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Good morning, and thank you for joining Newmont's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Rob Atkinson and Nancy Buese, along with other members of our executive team, and we will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Newmont delivered on a challenging third quarter, generating strong free cash flow, continuing to provide industry-leading shareholder returns, and investing in profitable projects, including our latest Ahafo North, which was approved by our board in July. This quarterly performance was achieved even as we continue to manage through the evolving complexities of the global pandemic, and we remain committed to protecting the health and well-being of our workforce and local communities. Throughout the mining sector, we are continuing to see the non-health-related challenges caused by the pandemic, including labor shortages, rising input costs, and supply chain disruptions. As an industry leader, Newmont is well-positioned to respond to these challenges by leveraging our proven operating model and balanced global portfolio to deliver long-term value from our responsibly managed assets. Turning to our quarterly results, let's take a look at the highlights. During the third quarter, Newmont produced 1.4 million ounces of gold and 315,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion and strong free cash flow of $735 million, of which $715 million is attributable to Newmont. Supported by our clear strategic focus, we continue to apply a disciplined and balanced approach to a capital allocation priorities. With $7.6 billion in total liquidity, we have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times, maintaining our financial flexibility, whilst we continue to reinvent in our business and return cash to our shareholders. Earlier this month, we announced the transition to a fully autonomous haulage fleet at Boddington, an important milestone for both Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. Our fleet of 36 trucks, with improved safety and productivity at this cornerstone asset. We also continue to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects, including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the change to a more productive underground mining method at Ahafo South and Yanacocha Sulfides. This quarter, we completed nearly $100 million of opportunistic share repurchases at an average price under $56 per share, and we declared a third quarter dividend of $0.55 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of over 4%. Twelve months ago, we announced that our industry-leading dividend framework, establishing a clear pathway for stable and predictable returns. Over the last four quarters, Newmont has returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of our business and our ability to maintain financial flexibility while steadily reinvesting in our operations. At Newmont, we have created a robust and diverse portfolio of operations and projects around the globe, and we believe that we rechoose to operate matters. Among our 12 operating mines and 2 joint ventures, over 90% of our attributable gold production is from top tier jurisdictions, which we define as countries classified in the A&B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. Underpinning our asset base is the gold industry's best organic project pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities, managed through our integrated operating model with a proven track record of delivering value to all of our stakeholders. Newmont has maintained an unmatched and industry-leading project pipeline, laying the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. Every one of our operations has near mine exploration opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure and extend mine life. With the stability and depth of our brownfield portfolio, we are able to explore in some of the most prospective greenfield districts in the world in a disciplined and deliberate way. This quarter, we've continued to advance our near-term projects, including the second expansion at Tanami in Australia's Northern Territory. Through the development of a 1.6-kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, this project supports the site's future as a long life and low-cost producer while providing a platform to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. The development of Ahafo North, approved in July, this project expands our existing footprint in Ghana, adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over on an initial 13-year mine life, and the Yanacocha Sulfides project, which will extend mine life at this cornerstone asset for decades to come. Newmont remains committed to the Yanacocha Sulfides project and will be investing at least $0.5 billion through 2022 to advance critical path activities, including detailed engineering, long lead procurement, earthworks, and the installation of accommodation facilities for the construction workforce. As previously announced, given the current status of the pandemic in Peru and the potential for more contagious variants, we have extended our full funds decision for the sulfides project to the second half of 2022 and will progress the project as the pandemic allows. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit Peru and engage with government leaders and other key stakeholders to talk about a safe and mutually beneficial path forward. I'm encouraged by these interactions and look forward to this next chapter, and let Yanacocha's long and profitable history. The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize the very significant efforts that are being applied at all of our operations to keep our workforce and local communities safe and healthy. As you can see in this photo, Rob had the opportunity to be at Ghana last quarter and experience firsthand the important work our team is doing to manage through the COVID pandemic with agility and resolve. In 2020 and 2021, Newmont has invested more $2.7 million for COVID relief and local support in Ghana, and $1.4 million in health screening and security measures to protect our people and their families. Through our partnership with Ghana Health and Education Services, these investments helped to: establish wide-ranging protocols and controls at both Ahafo and Akyem; distribute medical equipment and PPE at our mines, regional health facilities, and other regional institutions; to purchase PCR machines for effective testing and research; to donate cold storage units for temperature monitoring and vaccine storage; to raise awareness and share important health and safety messages through the local radio programs; and fundraiser programs that provide essential lesson plans for students during school closures. We're also focused on supporting the vaccination effort in Ghana and are working with the American Chamber of Commerce in Ghana and Ghana Health Services to secure and deploy nearly 100,000 vaccines in the area. At Newmont, we firmly believe that the COVID-19 vaccines are critical in combating the spread of a virus, and until global vaccination rates substantially improve, our people and operations will continue to be affected. We are now deliberately moving toward a position where ultimately, all of our global workforce will be fully vaccinated, and we are closely monitoring and adhering the national vaccination mandates already in place. We are taking this important step because we fundamentally believe that the vaccine is a critical part of supporting the recovery from a pandemic around the world. Since March of last year, our focus has been on operating responsibly and efficiently while protecting the health and safety of our workforce and local communities from this virus. Since the government imposed restrictions on movement and the ongoing application of COVID-related protocols, in addition to competitive labor markets in Canada and Australia, we continue to experience productivity impacts at many of our sites. Due to these impacts and some unexpected equipment reliability and weather-related challenges, we have decided to update our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect to produce approximately 6 million ounces of gold just below our original guidance range, and we are reaffirming our original guidance of 1.3 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Combined, 7.3 million gold equivalent ounces. The most of any Company in our industry and an improvement of almost 400,000 ounces compared to last year. Updates from our original gold production outlook are largely due to challenges at Boddington, Including unusually severe weather and heavy rainfall, shovel reliability, and operational delays associated with managing bench hygiene as mining moves into deeper sections of the pit. This was combined with the continued ramp-up of the autonomous haulage fleet as the site fine tunes this technology for operation in a deep open pit mine for the first time in the mining industry. As a result, Boddington delivered lower tonnes than expected, impacting our ability to reach high grades and reducing Boddington's full year gold production estimate by approximately 140,000 ounces. As Rob will discuss later, we remain very confident that the overall efficiencies delivered by autonomous haulage will more than offset any short-term impacts on production at Boddington this year. Also at Nevada Gold Mines, we are experiencing the consequences of the challenges noted by our operating partners in their release last week. Carlin and Cortez are expected to be at the low end of their annual guidance ranges, largely due to the impact of the breakdown and repairs to the mill at Carlin's Goldstrike roaster, and Turquoise Ridge is now expected to be below its annual guidance range. As a consequence, annual gold production from Nevada Gold Mines is expected to be at the low end of our annual guidance range. In addition to this, as I commented earlier, the global pandemic continues to evolve and impact all of operations. Tanami was placed into care and maintenance in late June and early July, and we are continuing to experience lower productivity as a result of COVID-related absenteeism and the tightening of the labor market in Canada. The impact from lower production volumes, coupled with higher mill prices, has also increased costs for the year. For 2021, gold cost applicable to sales are expected to be $790 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs are expected to be a $1050 per ounce. It's important to note that our regional guidance was established using a $1200 gold price assumption, and we continue to use this assumption for our long-term mine planning and reserve modeling to ensure that we would maintain discipline across all of our operations. However, due to the sustained high gold process throughout this year and in response to feedback from the investor community, we are providing our updated full year cost outlook using an $1800 gold price assumption. We expect these gold process to continue through the fourth quarter, adding approximately $50 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs from inflation, higher royalties, and production taxes. Finally, we are decreasing our development capital estimate from $850 million to $700 million, with a portion of our spending associated with the second expansion at Tanami moving into 2022, but not impacting project schedule. We're currently working to finalize our business plan for 2022, and today, we have a much better understanding of the impacts from the global pandemic than we need at this time last year. Looking ahead to 2022, we anticipate the production costs at an $1800 gold price assumption will be similar to this year. Gold production is expected to improve by around 5% compared to 2021 as we continue to manage the impacts from pandemic related labor shortages on productivity across our operations. CAS and AISC per ounce are expected to be largely in line with 2021, as we're building increased cost from inflation, high metal prices, and ongoing COVID-related safety protocols into our assumptions going forward. Capital in 2022 remains unchanged from our original outlook as we enter a period of significant reinvestment, an important component in growing production, improving margins, and extending mine life. These reinvestment back into our business will enable Newmont to steadily increase production and improve costs over time from our portfolio of world-class long-life operations. We look forward to providing you additional detail on our long-term outlook in our annual guidance webcast in early December. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning. As Tom mentioned, the pandemic continues to present challenges across our operations and joint ventures, and I am proud of our people who continues to safely deliver day in, day out. While COVID infection rates are declining and vaccination rates are improving near our operations, the knock-on effect from supply chain disruptions and tightening labor markets is creating new complexities to manage. There is increased pressure on input commodity prices such as steel and diesel in addition to unpredictable freight costs and timing of deliveries. As an example, digital costs have increased significantly in recent months, adding $7 per ounce to our all-in sustaining costs compared to the previous quarter and over $15 per ounce compared to the previous year. We are also keeping a close eye and working hard to reduce voluntary attrition rates across our global business and halt labor markets, particularly in Canada and Australia, by creating an unprecedented labor shortage impacting productivity. These inflation trends may show up in future contract renewals and we expect that we could start seeing additional impacts as early as the fourth quarter, and while it is difficult to predict whether these trends will persist for the long term, I am confident that our scale, strong partnerships, and proven operating model positions Newmont to secure the most competitive supply contracts and limit the impacts on productivity and costs. Turning to our regional updates, starting with South America. Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region and is celebrating the 5th anniversary since declaring commercial production in October 2016. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance, helping to offset unplanned mill maintenance and minor delays from heavy rain at the start of the quarter. Additionally, Merian delivered higher tonnes mined and grade processed, and we expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2022. Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance, significantly increasing tonnes mined and processed in each quarter. The site team is managing the impacts from the pandemic as well as possible, and I am proud of the mitigation efforts, shift change optimization, and overall efficiency improvements delivered to help offset disruptions from earlier in the year. Given the effects of the pandemic, the site has delivered lower development rates in 2021, limiting access to higher grade ore and reducing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Yet, despite challenges from the virus, the site continues to progress future organic growth projects, including the development of San Marcos and the expansion in the Eastern District, which have the potential to extend mine life beyond 2030. Yanacocha has also experienced continued challenges from the pandemic impacting productivity, mainly due to reduced labor availability. To offset these challenges, the sites implemented mine sequencing changes, focusing on higher grades, efficient haul truck routes, and optimal ore placement on the leach pads. As a result, Yanacocha delivered high grade of ore and improved recovery from the leach pads. As discussed in our third quarter 10-Q, we continue to progress detailed study work to further define water management requirements, along with other closure activities, and we will provide an update on this with the fourth quarter result. As Tom mentioned, we're progressing the Yanacocha Sulfides. A project with the potential to extend mine life at this cornerstone asset well beyond 2040. Turning to our North American region. At our Canadian operations, Musselwhite, Eleonore, and Porcupine, we continue to be impacted by COVID absenteeism and a tightening of the Canadian labor market, and we expect these sites to be at the low end or below our annual production guidance ranges. We expect these labor trends to continue into 2022, with the effects having been particularly impactful at Musselwhite and Eleonore as labor shortages and access to specialized services has resulted in lower tonnes mined and processed and planned. Porcupine delivered higher tonnes mined from the Hollinger open pit, helping to balance the impact of higher than expected levels of graphite in the oil plant underground, which resulted in drilling delays, and as a consequence, resulted in less high grade ore being mined from the underground. I visited our Canadian operations last month, and I'm pleased to report that we are making a lot of positive inroads at Musselwhite, Eleonore, and Porcupine to increase development rates through the use of jumbos and tele-remote loaders in driving productivity hard through the execution of the suite of our full potential initiatives. With the full support of our subject matter experts deployed to these sites, these initiatives will improve efficiency and production. Moving to CC&V, the mine experienced lower grades and recovery in the third quarter. However, higher tonnes mined and changes to mine sequencing during the third quarter are expected to increase leach pad production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Finally, Penasquito delivered another strong performance in the third quarter due to higher tonnes mined and processed, in addition to strong recovery rates from a number of full potential improvements. Since acquisition, Penasquito has delivered over $375 million in free cash flow improvements, with more than 80% of this value delivered from mining and processing improvements, which continued to generate value today and will do so well into the future. Shifting to Australia. Tanami delivered solid performance in the third quarter as higher grades helped to offset lower tonnes mined and processed as a consequence of the COVID-related care maintenance period in late June and early July. Although this period has reduced the site's full year production by approximately 40,000 ounces, Tanami is fully operational, performing very well, and is fully expected to deliver a strong finish to the year. In addition, the team further advanced Tanami Expansion II, and during the third quarter, we progressed the construction of the head frame and have now completed nearly 70% of the reaming of the nearly 1-mile deep shaft, remaining on track to deliver significant ounce, cost, and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. As Tom mentioned, Boddington experienced heavy rainfall in the third quarter, impacting the ramp-up of autonomous haulage and reducing tonnes mined. I'm pleased to share that Boddington continues to achieve superior mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tonnes processed during the third quarter. We are also proud to deliver the gold industry's first autonomous haul truck fleet, the first of its kind in our sector. I'd like to thank our team and our partners at Caterpillar for their ongoing partnership, dedication, and drive as Boddington continues to ramp up the truck fleet to full productivity and to fine-tune the technology for a very productive operation in a deep open pit mine. Delivering this project on time and on budget during a global pandemic is an enormous accomplishment, leveraging Newmont's scale, technical expertise, and partnerships to manufacture, deliver, assemble, commission, and operate a fleet of 36 autonomous trucks in less than 18 months. As we look ahead, we expect to reach improved grades and achieve higher tonnes mined, due in part to the efficiencies from autonomous haulage, increasing production in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Finally, turning to Africa. A team delivered another consistent performance despite very heavy rainfall in the third quarter, as higher throughput and strong recoveries helped to offset unplanned mill and equipment maintenance. The site is well-positioned to reach higher grades and deliver its highest production of the year during the fourth quarter. Ahafo delivered a very strong third quarter. This higher tonnage mine for the Subika open pit and improved mill performance helped to offset challenges with haul truck availability at our underground operation. At Subika, we continue to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage, and we expect to reach full production by year-end as planned, improving grade and underground tonnes mined. In addition, the team continues to advance Ahafo North. We have begun mobilizing key personnel, and I'm pleased to say that engineering is approximately 80% complete. We continue to engage with local communities and regulators to ensure a mutually beneficial path forward as we develop this prolific orebody and create the next generation of mining in Ghana. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on the next slide.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Through the strength of our assets and integrated operating model, Newmont is in the best financial position in its 100-year history, building long-term value with the most disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation in the industry. Let's take a look at the financial highlights. In the third quarter, Newmont delivered $2.9 billion in revenue at an average realized gold price of $1,778 per ounce. Adjusted Net Income of $483 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of over $1.3 billion, a decrease from the prior year's quarter due to lower gold prices, lower sales volumes, and cost pressures stemming from the global pandemic, and strong free cash flow of $735 million of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. Although quarterly free cash flow is lower than our record performance last year, we achieved a 27% improvement compared to the second quarter. Our unmatched cash flow generation allows Newmont to provide superior shareholder return, largely through our industry-leading dividend framework. This week, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of 38% over the prior year and consistent with our last three quarters. With a yield of approximately 4%, our regular dividend is the highest in the gold industry, placing Newmont among the top 10% of the S&P's large-cap dividend payers. Third quarter GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $8 million or $0.01 per share.  Adjustments included $0.46 related to a loss recognized on the pending sale of the Conga mill assets, currently in care and maintenance in Peru, The sale of these assets reduce the storage costs while we maintain long-term optionality around the future development of the project. Adjustments also include $0.12 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.10 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.08 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance, and $0.01 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported third quarter adjusted net income of $0.60 per diluted shares. As a reminder, due to our status as a U.S. GAAP filer, our adjustments to net income do not include $23 million of incremental costs incurred this quarter as a result of the COVID pandemic. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in approximately $0.03 of additional net income per share, and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local community. Newmont's dividend framework is based on our unmatched ability to generate attributable free cash flow. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption of $1200, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only Company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow. As Tom mentioned, we announced our dividend framework one year ago, providing shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share and the potential to receive between 40% and 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated above the $1200 gold price. This framework provides stable and predictable industry-leading returns for our shareholders and demonstrates our confidence in our long-term outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. The third quarter dividend declared was consistent with our second quarter, calibrated at $1,800 gold price assumption, and 40% distribution, and incremental free cash flow. We continue to review our dividend on a quarterly basis with our Board, evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook over a long period of time. Our capital allocation priorities remain clear. To reinvest in our business through exploration in organic growth projects, to maintain financial strength and optionality on our balance sheet, and to provide industry-leading returns to shareholders. Throughout the year, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business, particularly with the advancement of the Tanami expansion, Ahafo North, and Yanacocha Sulfides. Delivering the first autonomous haulage fleet in the gold mining industry, improving safety and productivity at Boddington, completing the GT Gold transaction in May of this year, returning more than $1.3 billion to shareholders per dividends and nearly $250 million through opportunistic share buybacks, and maintaining a strong balance sheet with $7.6 billion in liquidity and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times, preserving Newmont's financial strength and flexibility to sustain the business across price [Indiscernible] with one of the industry's lowest weighted average cost of debt at 4.3%. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our disciplined capital allocation priorities, creating long-term value for the business, and maintaining our position as the world's leading gold Company. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom to wrap up.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Newmont has an unmatched portfolio of world-class long-life operations and an organic project pipeline that is the best in the industry. While we and, the broader mining industry continue to face a range of challenges brought forth by this global pandemic, I am confident that our key strategic focus, proven operating model, superior execution, and leading ESG practices has positioned Newmont to remain the world's leading gold Company and continue to deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, first on Slide 11 on the North American operations. Can you talk a little bit about what steps are being taken to address the absenteeism at Musselwhite and Eleonore? As far as I can tell, some of your Canadian competitors aren't facing similar issues. I'm just curious, what exactly is happening there and what steps are being taken? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad, and good morning. I'll pass the question across to Rob. We're seeing a combination of two things that I think Rob can expand on in terms of actions we're taking. Voluntary attrition, particularly at the Company, on the fly in, fly out site. So still at levels that you typically expect in a FIFO site, the low teens, 12%, 13%. What we're seeing on top of that is the compounding absenteeism associated with COVID. So you can get 10% to 15% absenteeism. On top of that where people are unable to attend work because of COVID-related absences. But that sits behind the number, two of our three sites are FIFO sites, and I'll let Rob to talk to some of the actions we're taking to mitigate and control that trend.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tom, and Fahad, the other thing I'd just mention to build on what Tom said, to certainly [Indiscernible] there were points in the third quarter were some of the highest infection rates of COVID in Canada as well, and in particular, at Musselwhite, we were up to 15% absenteeism because of what Tom spoke about. We've taken the basic steps where every person who's absent is being case-managed, very high profile in terms of who's at work, who's not, the reasons why, and the follow-up and the necessary management there. There's also in terms of recruitment, we've got a very focused team, dedicated team just on the Canadian sign market to make sure that we are something around employment as quickly as possible, try and bring new employees and onboarding them very, very quickly. But certainly, it boils into the basics as the vaccination rates go up, as the controls enter and really doing the basics of managing well. If there are people that we're seeing regularly off, they're being managed very, very closely. But, there's nothing, no rocket science, it's really just doing the basics very, very well.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, great, and then maybe just switching gears to Ahafo. I don't think the guidance changed for the full year, so it implies a really high production rate in Q4. Rob, maybe if you could just speak to that. Is that the expectation?
Tom Palmer: Fahad, I'll pick that up and again throw across to Rob. But we are certainly is going to see a strong fourth quarter out of Ahafo compared to the first three quarters, which were pretty consistent. Rob will continue to talk to the drivers behind that strong fourth quarter.
Rob Atkinson: Certainly, that underground continues to come along very well and we did our first firing earlier in the year for the sublevel shrinkage, so we are seeing higher grade come through there, and the performance of Ahafo in generally in the open pit and in the middle has been very positive. I think, it's, again, just the factors of the decision we made around the underground, really starting to bear fruit as well as good productivity elsewhere in the operation.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Glick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Glick: Hi. On costs, could you walk us through what you're currently seeing down to specific items such as consumables and other raw materials? How you're working to mitigate inflation from the CapEx and OpEx perspective going forward? Then kind of based on what you're seeing in 4Q, how should the cost trajectory look into 2022?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Michael. I'll kick-off, get Rob to provide some color. I'll also ask Dean Gehring, who is our Chief Technology Officer and is accountable for our global supply chain to make some comments on trends as well. We've been flagging at the end of last quarter that we're seeing cost inflation trends are starting to see some of those flow through now, and it's part of our fourth quarter story, and we're certainly seeing those flowing into at least 2022, and that was part of our comments about how we're starting to see 2022 shape up. So 2022 is, I think, going to be for the mining industry, a cost escalation story. We've got pretty consistent, little, on improvement on production. So there's certainly a cost escalation story. We're seeing it still upwards of around 5% when you aggregate it all together across materials, energy, and labor. But we are seeing some pretty significant movements within that aggregated number. In fact, in some instances, we're seeing some improved costs, adversely in Australia, CAT parts, Caterpillar parts are coming in cheaper as a consequence of exchange rates and the like. But we are seeing some significant trends, as I say, at this stage, aggregated at around the 5% mark. Rob, if you want to add any color to that? Then, Dean, if you can build on them.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom, and I may just talk about what Michael asked in terms of what are we doing to offset it and before handing over to Dean around the prices and the inflation that, Michael, very much the full potential is what we're focused on is at all operations. They've got a suite of projects, which not only assist productivity, but it's also about cost reduction, and the big movers that we're focused on is things at Penasquito, including the recovery, which we're seeing significant benefits as a result of that. In the Canadian sites, we've moved across to jumbo rigs instead of McClean bolters and tele-remote loaders, which is improving our productivity significantly, and even doing more of the basics at Cerro Negro, where we've just reduced further equipment, we took a further 15 pieces of HME dealers in the third quarter to make sure that we're running that fleets as efficiently as possible and as such, just managing the consumables that we do need. But the full potential is the way in which we're managing. But Dean, do you want to talk inflation?
Dean Gehring: Yes. Thanks, Rob. One of the big areas where we see probably the largest variability is actually in freight, but we do unpack that a bit, freight makes up about 2.5% to 5% of all of our landed costs for major consumables. So you need to keep that in perspective. But one of the things we're doing to mitigate that as we're looking for opportunities, using the ability of our global supply chain, looking at our operations in a global sense, seeing what we can do to maximize the amount of freight we put on either ships or containers, so we get the best pricing possible. The other thing that we do is along the lines of mitigation is we actually put in place pricing mechanism that are transparent, and they're really based largely on the input pricing of a lot of the commodities that we have, and so that helps to actually soften the impact of inflation that we see.
Michael Glick: Then could you talk about your view on industry consolidation? Just all the things you just mentioned would seem to point to more scale as the more effective way to operate in this environment.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Michael. Certainly, I see in our industry with the number of publicly listed companies in the gold space is order of magnitude more than any other commodity. That in itself says there's an opportunity for consolidation in terms of the additional [Indiscernible] that you have. The elevated gold prices, I think, probably hold off a lot of that consolidation. I think I don't believe that it will be necessarily some of these near to medium-term cost escalation that will drive consolidation. I believe that the issue around the work that needs to take place for all mining companies to achieve 2030 carbon reduction targets, greenhouse gas reduction targets, and ambitions to achieve net zero by 2050, which we're clearly seeing many governments around the world sign up to in order to achieve those targets, you will need scale and you will need life, and over the course of this decade, we will see consolidation driven by that imperative. So I predict climate change will be the driver rather than some near-term COVID related escalation.
Michael Glick: Understood. Thank you very much.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Thank you. Tom, I just want to understand the deployment of the autonomous truck fleet at Boddington. I know you did it on time on budget, but you seem to be having some challenges to get it working the way you want it to work. What are those challenges and what are you doing to address it?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg, and good morning. The key challenge behind commissioning the autonomous fleet, and I'll get Rob to provide some more color, was associated with the significant whether that you had in that mine at the time you're trying to commission the trucks. We're through and now got the truck's commission and some of those tuning issues in place. As I said, I'll pass across the Rob to give you some color on how that fleet is performing now that we've had about a month under our belt of fully autonomous operation in that mine, which is one of the factors when you can actually move to fully autonomous and you're not managing the interaction with vehicles that have people inside of them. As Rob provides you some detail, it's in the context of whether it's continued in Southwestern Australia. In fact, October, not even the end of the month, is already the wettest month since records began in that part of the world. So in that context, I'll get Rob to give you some color on how autonomous haulage is performing.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom, and thanks for the question, Greg. Certainly, with every passing week, the autonomous haulage is getting more and more productive, and just to tell a little bit of the story is that, since we initiated zero injuries, we've now done over 600,000 kilometers. Were up about 21 million tonnes, and we've connected all the machines. So there's an awful lot of good work, which is going on. At the start of September, we were around about 53% EU, which is one of the critical metrics of making sure that the trucks are utilized as much as possible. We're now up above the 61% over the last week, and we've actually hit shift by shift up around the 68%, 69% a year. Now, we've got to achieve that on a consistent basis. But one of the critical things, particularly important for next year is that next year's tonnage is roughly averaging about a 135,000 tonnes out of the pit. We've already achieved 160,000 [Indiscernible] . So while we've still got things, just a high note and to fine tune, as Tom said, whether it be some road widths, whether it's the road conditions as a result of the wet weather, etc. We are very pleased about how things are progressing. We've got terrific support from Caterpillar. We've got a number of people from Caterpillar dedicated on the site. So certainly, we think things are progressing well, but the rain plays havoc. I'll be honest. But in term of commissioning, we've still got to remember, it's been the quickest commissioning of any EHS system that's being achieved to date, and so far, that every passing week, as I said, things get better.
Tom Palmer: Greg, those expect tonnes are presenting to the mill, the mill is running exceptionally well, and it's running at record rates. So we are confident around the fourth quarter, particularly as we enter into the next year for that truck fleet to deliver would expect tonnes in our mills are performing well.
Greg Barnes: I'm not sure what 68% EU means, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Sorry, Greg. Basically, it's essentially seeing how often is your truck running, doing productive work, and typically, one of the key reasons that we went to autonomous is that if you've got humans operating them, typically, you got lunch delays, you get toilet breaks, you get things like that, and the EU is one of the key metrics.
Tom Palmer: The EU is effective utilization, Greg.
Greg Barnes: Okay, so what's the targeted EU for the autonomous fleet versus a human fleet, I guess?
Rob Atkinson: The target that we justify it on is 68%, and certainly, where we will be planning is certainly trying to achieve a lot higher than that.
Greg Barnes: So you already achieved the targeted rate then?
Rob Atkinson: No. We've achieved that intra-shift kind of levels, where we have just been running the average is around about that 60%, 61%. So as I said, with each passing shift, we're getting further insights, further improvements. I'm very, very confident we'll be up there and hitting those targets day-in, day-out next year.
Greg Barnes: Okay, great. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Josh Wolfson: Thank you very much for taking my questions. I appreciate the disclosure for the 2022 preview on the expectations. Looking at the existing 5 year guidance, there was some expectation for cost reduction into 2022. There's a big step down there previously, and then some reduction expected thereafter in future years 2023 and '24 as well. When you look at the trends that we're seeing in the sector, should we still expect that kind of trajectory longer term? Or is there a potential that some of the operating improvements are going to be offset by these trends just to mean they continue?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Josh, and good morning. You're certainly going to see costs at Newmont and in the industry all about it because of these escalation pressures that we've been talking about, the inflation pressures. But the cost improvement is still coming at Newmont. Because it's associated with the reinvestment we're making back in our business. So we'll continue to see improvements out of Boddington with autonomous haulage as it's now being commissioned, as Rob was just talking about how you can tune a very predictable autonomous system because of the automation now of the fleet. We'll see improvements from the commissioning of the shaft at Tanami. We can bring ore at surface much more efficiently. The underground mining method at Subika, the near-mine Ahafo North, and Yanacocha Sulfides are all investments that we're making that will deliver improved costs over the guidance for five-plus year period. So those investments being made, so improvement in costs will come to those investments because we'll be delivering and producing ounces at much better margins. What we're seeing as a consequence of COVID is those three key development projects, Tanami 2, Ahafo North, and Yanacocha Sulfides have been delayed and sitting on top of each other some more. So we will see through '22 and '23 a significant development capital spend. In fact, it will be a development capital spend that we haven't executed at Newmont in a generation, so it's a significant reinvestment in our business, and we really start to see the benefit from that investment later part of '23, into '24, '25, '26, and '27 with some of those projects. A slight delay in terms of when we see those better margin ounces coming through and some stacking up of that development capital as a consequence of managing around COVID.
Josh Wolfson: Okay, thank you, and then on the capital numbers. Similarly, there's been a number of changes for some of the existing projects and sequencing, obviously, with Yanacocha Sulfides, how should we be thinking about that? It sounds like the baseline sustaining capital numbers maybe should be higher longer term? Is that reasonable to assume?
Tom Palmer: Josh, sustaining capital for a portfolio of our size is really about $1 billion. It might be $951 million a year, $1.50 billion another year. As I look at our business plan, it's a pretty steady spend for a portfolio of our size around the even $1 billion. For the development capital, Mike and Rob just can provide a little bit more color. But for both Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North, some of the factors that impact cost wave got locked in. I'll get Rob to cover those two. So Yanacocha Sulfides, obviously, we delayed the full time due to COVID through the second half of next year. We're continuing to do all the detailed engineering. We're continuing to do the critical path to procurement, which is locking in factory slots for oxygen plants and specialized steel, for the clothes and the likes. So we are de-risking Yanacocha Sulfides in this environment. Then Rob made some color on Tanami 2 and Ahafo North in terms of cost.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks so much, Tom. In terms of Tanami 2, the engineering is progressing very well, and it's at that high level where you've got a high degree of confidence around what you need to do. The vast majority of the cost at Tanami is around the reaming and the outfitting of the shafts. So we're certainly confident at this point in time that that work is contained. The biggest challenge we've got is just around the labor rates, and again, the post-COVID world in Australia in terms of orders, how that's managed. But that's where the majority of costs are, and we've got a good partner in [Indiscernible] , and as I said, the engineering being so well progressed is so key. At Ahafo North, we pre-ordered all the equipment and so that equipment is making its way over or being manufactured as we speak. The engineering again was at a very high level, and we've got a little bit of contingency there, but we're not seeing anything at the moment that's overly worrying us. They are apart from what Dean said in terms of potential delays and the offset nature of the three business. But all in all, because the engineering is so well progressed, I think we've got a high degree of confidence.
Josh Wolfson: Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Rob, can I just keep you on, again, just to clarify on Boddington, and Greg asked it, and I didn't know what that EU was either, but wanted to just make sure I understood that with the rain hopefully behind us, keeping the roads clear and clean, these automated trucks are performing as you expect, because they keep stopping. So I'm just wondering if we've taken out the issues than just stopping like we've cleaned it out with Caterpillar?
Rob Atkinson: Yes, Tanya, in terms of the communication, those are things which we have found out, there's going to be time to time where you do get a communication issue for very general reasons and the system is built, but if there is a communication issue, things stop. We've certainly manage to do that very well, especially the deep mine, that there's some new techniques being done compared to the program. But in terms of the roads, the feedback that I have had from the Boddington team, that the roads are in better shape than they've ever been, and certainly, these trucks are able to pick up an awful lot of detail, whether it be rusting, whether it'd be rocks coming into the road, whether it be wash-outs from burns, etc. So there is a huge amount of attention there and when I talk about road widths, the team has done an enormous amounts of work. But all in all, Tanya, that certainly, we are in good shape, the roads are in good shape, the technology is in good shape. The only thing that it still see is it's still raining, and that's something we'll continue to manage. But on the plus side, the experience we're getting here sets us up very well for wet seasons in the future.
Tom Palmer: So just building on that, Tanya, the fleet is performing at record levels or required levels, even during a wet October at Boddington. We're about to enter into summer in Western Australia, and you don't see a cloud in the sky from about November through to March, April, so the system is tuned and well set up to have a very solid run over the next six months and beyond.
Tanya Jakusconek: We're getting better grades on top of that, right?
Tom Palmer: Yes, we're sitting right on top of the higher grades in the South [Indiscernible] at Boddington.
Tanya Jakusconek: Maybe just still in Australia. Rob, on Tanami expansion, like you mentioned, that deferral of $150 million in capital and it has not impacted the timeline. Can you just share with us or more details on what exactly is being deferred? Should I take that $150 million and add it to the 2020 capital? Which I think Tom mentioned was going to be similar, like no change to CapEx for 2022. So maybe just some clarity there.
Rob Atkinson: In terms of the CapEx, Tanya, it's going to be spread over '22 and '23. It's not all going to come in '22, and in terms of the key work, it really is around completing the reaming and starting to outfit the shafts. So in terms of the schedule of that work, it's still very much on track. That capital will be spread over the next couple of years rather than just next year.
Tom Palmer: Tanya, to this broader question, our development capital spend will be similar levels to what we're currently guiding to '22 and '23, and what you'll see into '24 is a little bit of that, a little bit more capital in '24 as a consequence of the three key projects sitting on top of each other, there's a delay in Yanacocha Sulfides. So similar spend levels, a little bit more in 24.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Great, that's helpful, and then, Tom, I'll have you on, just two questions for you. You mentioned supply chain disruptions. I'd like to get better clarity on what you're seeing, and that's the first question. The second question is, as we are seeing these inflationary pressures come through the cost structures, are we looking at you adjusting gold prices for your reserves and resources next year? Also, given the higher gold price, can we see you have a higher gold price for guidance for cost for next year?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya. We will continue to try and do a long-term mine planning reserve and resources at $1200. That maintains a discipline in our strategic mine planning and ensuring that we're then making very conscious decisions if we want to try and cut off grades to bring certain [Indiscernible] . Strategic mine planning and acquisition of reserves or resources now change to the $1200, and yes, we will provide you cost guidance next year, at the $1800 gold price assumption, and as in the script, our all-in sustaining costs next year, assuming gold is at $1,800 is going to be pretty much the same number that you're seeing for this year as we start to pull together our plan. There's still a few moving parts. Nevada Gold Mines due to come in, but everything is direction according to similar levels to this year at $1,800 gold price. Drivers become more cost than production drivers as they have been for this year. Our gold production is sitting up around 5% more than this year. So if you want to put a pin on that number, it's probably going to be around 6.2 million ounces for next year. We will continue to provide a view of all-in sustaining cost at $1,200 gold revenue price. So we'll continue to provide that as a reference point in our guidance, but we will give you the $1,800, we'll assume $1,800 flat for the five years that we guide to and show you that cost profile. Dean or Mike, if you just to talk to Tanya's first part of the question around supply chain disruption and what we're seeing there.
Dean Gehring: Sure, Tom, thanks. Tanya, the main place that we're seeing this supply chain disruption is really on the logistics, the freight or shipping and what's driving that is availability on inland shipping and freight, it's just the availability of truck drivers. We're seeing that the manufacturers, the factories just kind of work their way through COVID. They're getting back up to production. But the market consensus is that we're still going to see this persistent pressure through the end of the year, largely driven by the availability of people to move the products around.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Thank you for that. Thanks, Tom, I just wanted to make sure those costs were at $1,800 and not at $1,200, and then I have to adjust upwards. So thanks for the clarity.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya. Operator, for the people on the call, we'll keep going and take everyone's questions. If we've got the time available, we'll stay on the call as long as need be to answer questions. So operator, we're ready for the next one.
Operator: The next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Hi. So a couple of questions still remain. You said that the cash costs around $790 million and your prior guidance was $650 million to $750 million, right? Now you're saying, 6.2% as the production number. So you're kind of at the low end of your original guidance range on production. So I just want to build back that 5% escalation and how much additionally on the price change? Then just seeing it that gets you to that $790 million. So could you tell me how much the royalties would impact the terms in the gold price first?
Tom Palmer: So, Anita, just to make sure I've understood your question. So you're talking about 2022?
Anita Soni: Yes. I'm talking about 2022, and I'm just saying, I'm basically looking at the fact that you're talking about 5% escalation. I mean, that's what you keep coming on the cost side. But the midpoint of the old range, would have said, that's about $35 an ounce. So I guess we're not at the midpoint because we're not on midpoint on production. So I'd be at the higher end on that, and then just trying to build back the difference to try to get to the $790 million if there's some missing components that I don't have in getting to $790 million?
Tom Palmer: So you've got production impact, you've got an inflation impact of about 5%, and then you've got your taxes, production taxes and royalties. The combination of those three will bridge the gap between our $1,200 to our $1,800 number in 2022.
Anita Soni: Is the royalty impact about $15 to $20 per ounce?
Tom Palmer: No, more. At least 30.
Anita Soni: Okay. $30 per ounce, and then the $115 million Tanami deferral, you maintain the $2 to $2.2 million for 2022. I would've expected that, I guess, to go up if you're deferring to Tanami CapEx? Or is it just a matter that the net is being pushed out consistently, so the 2022 spend related to Tanami is being pushed into 2023 and perhaps some into 2024. Is that the way it works or is there some offset?
Tom Palmer: No, it's essentially that wave moving for Tanami from '21 into '22 and what's in '22 moving to '23, and then if you look at our overall development capital number, there's some Ahafo North numbers that we assumed in '21 but move into '22 and then pushes out into '23 and '24. Then Yanacocha Sulfides has a similar [Indiscernible] , it's a combination of the three with that spend moving around that ends up with some more issues when we guided, you'll see some more development capital in '24, but similar rates for the Newmont portfolio in '22 and '23.
Anita Soni: The new guide in December, it will continue to not include the Yanacocha Sulfides spend, because it hasn't really gotten full funds decision?
Tom Palmer: So the Yanacocha Sulfides spend is included in our current guidance. Yanacocha Sulfides spend with a delay in full funds approval to the second half of the year will be in our updated guidance in early December. The nature of the timing of that project is that when you look at a five-year view of our production, you're only going to see a very small number of the gold and copper coming into our production profile. We really get the benefit of that gold and copper at good prices in '27, '28, and beyond. So we're going to see the spend, but we're not going to see the benefit in our five-year guidance.
Anita Soni: So just to reiterate, the intense capital spend that you have in the next two years include Yanacocha Sulfides spend, the $2 billion number for the next few years?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Yes, it does.
Anita Soni: Okay. All right. Thank you. Sorry, and actually, probably to the point, the fall off in 2024, that also includes Yanacocha Sulfides spend?
Tom Palmer: Yes, that's right. So what you are seeing in our development capital spend over the five years in our current guidance includes the big ticket items of Tanami 2, Ahafo North, and Yanacocha Sulfides.
Anita Soni: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian MacArthur of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Brian MacArthur: Hi, good morning. I think you just answered my question there, but one other thing I just wanted to follow-up on is Conga. So I have three questions. What triggered this to do this now where there's anything to do with changing government or anything? Second, total book value of $570 million for $68 million, and you talked about equipment and assets. So I assume $68 million is equipment and assets is something else. But any clarity on this? I'm just trying to figure out what's in there. Then three, there's still $900 million on the books. Is there stuff there that you can use in Yanacocha Sulfides, other equipment, or stuff? I'm just trying to figure out exactly what that transaction is.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Brian, and I'll take your first and third, and I'll ask Nancy to talk to the book value. So the $900 million that's there is the deposit, it's the reserves, value of that, and then we constructed a quite significant dam. So that infrastructure is still there and valued. Of course, we had a mine there once upon a time, so we know the orebody. We're going to build a mine there once upon a time to know the orebody very well. [Indiscernible] for care and maintenance to keep the mill and all its bits and pieces in good condition. It's a very large mill. In fact, at the time, it was the largest mill in the world, and so it's quite unique in terms of who would buy that piece of equipment and use it. So when we had an approach from somebody to buy that equipment because they had a place to sell it, then, you take the opportunity to sell that mill. So the timing really came from someone coming to knock on our door to say, we're interested in taking that mill off your hands. We saved the care and maintenance costs and in any future development of Conga, which is still some time off. The flow sheet will be very, very different. It wouldn't involve a flow sheet with a very large mill. So the trigger was an approach by somebody who's prepared to take quite a unique piece of equipment and for us to get some money for it. Nancy, do you want to talk to the book value question?
Nancy Buese: Yes. The carrying value really just represents what was on the book minus depreciation over the period of time that we've held it, and so the loss just triggered by the actual sale, but truly nothing more than that. It's been there for quite some time.
Brian MacArthur: Great. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: The next question comes from Danielle Chigumira of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Danielle Chigumira: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Another follow-up on the Tanami expansion. I just wanted to get some clarity on the fact that we've delayed $150 million of CapEx, but kept the overall CapEx budget flat versus the previous guidance. So what gives you confidence that the overall budget won't inflate, given the tightness that we're seeing in the labor markets and so on? That's the first question.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Danielle, and I'll kick off and pass across to Rob. The nature of where we're at with the Tanami expansion project having largely well about 70% sunk the shaft now, you're really in a very serial process with a dedicated contractor to then line that shaft. So I'd say it's just a serious process that takes quite a number of months to concrete line the wall of the shaft and put the various supporting infrastructure around it. So we're very clear, given the amount of progress we've made on the pathway in front of us, and we've got the best contractor in the business mobilized to site to do that work, and because we've got that clarity in terms of your contracted clarity in terms of the amount of work we've done on the schedule in front of us, we have confidence around both our schedule and spend. But Rob, do you want to put a little bit of color on that?
Rob Atkinson: In this building a little bit more on that, Danielle, Tanami 2, you will see in the presentation the picture of a head frame and that's come along well. The refrigeration has progressed well. We finished the crusher chamber on the ground. The power station extension has continued, the box cuts have been done. So as Tom said, we haven't got anything to start, and really, it is making sure that we maintain and keep hold of the expertise that we need to do the reaming and to do that shaft lining. Those are the key thing.
Tom Palmer: Danielle, the risk then with that nature of work in front of you is being able to get people to the mine site to do the work, and as vaccination rates in Australia are now up in the mid-70% and very much on a trajectory to earlier the new year to be 90+% across the whole of the country. Some of the challenges of being able to move people around the country through the state boarders will drop away in the first quarter, and we'll have a clear run through to be able to have basically the [Indiscernible] on-site to do the work.
Danielle Chigumira: Thank you. That's very useful, and on a completely different track. For Penasquito, have you seen any impact of the new labor law introduced in September in terms of limiting use of contractors, does that impact you at all?
Tom Palmer: None whatsoever, Danielle, and we fully comply with those legal requirements, but no impact, in fact, Penasquito is running superb. It's really hitting its strengths.
Danielle Chigumira: Thank you. That's useful.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Danielle.
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Adam Josephson: Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I appreciate you doing so. Tom, on your production comments for next year, given what you've experienced this year, what gives you confidence in that 5% growth forecast for next year, and along somewhat similar lines, how do you feel about the 2023 outlook that you gave last December in light of what you've seen thus far this year?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. Very confident in the number that we're looking at for next year. I look at that number and we have a number of world-class assets that make up that production number. So in Australia, Boddington and Tanami are important contributors. Australia is just about through the worst of all the constraints they've had around COVID restrictions, hot label market, so it's more cost issue, a autonomous haul had just in running at Boddington, which is the largest area for labor at Boddington. If you didn't have autonomous all trucks, we've just mitigated that area with that fleet. So that production number underpinned by those two big assets in Australia, very confident. Ahafo South in Ghana, underground mining method coming on stream as we speak. It's set up for a very solid year, very much rolling out the vaccines now in Ghana, as I mentioned in my comments, 100,000 vaccines that we're looking to distribute not only to our workforce, but their families and the communities in which we live and work. Penasquito, as I just mentioned into Danielle's question, it is really hitting its straps and running well. That is the engine room of Newmont, and then Nevada Gold Mines, Carlin, Cortez and Turquoise Ridge, fully expect that those three big world-class assets, along with Pueblo Viejo, will continue to deliver on their commitments. A little color on Pueblo Viejo. We had a few of our team down there in the last couple of weeks. Their vaccination rates are essentially 100%. So the ability for that operation, the Dominican Republic to continue to run and run well. So Newmont will deliver on its production outlook. If those assets that I mentioned deliver on their commitments, and I'm confident that those assets will. In terms to 2023, you will have an impact. COVID is going to be with us for awhile. So you will have an impact where we've had a couple of years where you haven't been able to do the development rates that you would have ideally liked to as you're managing health and safety and all the other controls. So that will have a flow on impact through 2022 and 2023, as well as some of the delays on our development capital spend, and we need to get some of the ounces flowing through from those projects. So I think you'll see a COVID-related impact on '22 and '23. So it's fairly flat, and then you'll get some benefits coming more in the '24 and '25. So a little bit of delay as a result of both COVID. COVID impacts both operating and what you're doing to develop in your mines, as well as your development in key growth capital spend.
Adam Josephson: I appreciate that. On the inflation topic, you said, I think on the last call that you expected that the inflation of the 5-ish percent to run through at least the end of next year. I'm just wondering, based on your experience in previous cycles, how long have these inflation cycles typically lasted? What do you expect? I mean, at what point consequently would you expect this inflation is start to abate? Is it just a situation of high prices of a cure for high prices and eventually, these high prices are going to choke off some economic growth? Or how are you thinking along those lines?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. I think the world is in uncharted territory in terms of these inflation. So I don't believe it's structural. I believe it will be cyclical, but I think it will be a longer cycle than normal, and COVID is going to dictate that cycle. So certainly seeing all the indicators or so we're going to have elevated pricing, and that's going to be with us through 2022. I'd say too early to predict to see whether that cycle then comes down again in '23 or stays there. We'll put a lot of attention into our 2022 cost guidance to include inflation, and then typically, we don't tend to try and predict that far out into the future with our cost numbers. So we would talk to our '23 and beyond numbers and not fully having accommodated inflation, we'll just do it the next year. It's very hard to predict that.
Adam Josephson: I really appreciate that, Tom. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us, and please, as the world is starting to open up, please take care of your health and safety and the safety of your loved ones, particularly as we enter into the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. But thank you for your time, everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Colby, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Eric Colby: Good morning, and thank you for joining Newmont’s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Today, we have Tom Palmer, Rob Atkinson, and Nancy Buese. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call, along with other members of our executive team. Please note our cautionary statement on Slide 2 and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. I’ll now turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. In May, Newmont celebrated its 100th birthday, marking a major milestone in our company's long history of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. And while our organization has certainly evolved our strategy remains clear. We are focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders from our world-class portfolio of long life responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions. Turning to Slide 4 for a summary of our quarterly performance. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.45 million ounces of gold and over 300,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc as we build momentum for a strong second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of nearly $1 billion and free cash flow of $578 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. In May, we completed the acquisition of GT Gold, consolidating our position in the highly perspective Golden Triangle District of British Columbia. And last week, we announced the approval of Ahafo North project, expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over a 13-year mine life. This project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices and offers exciting exploration opportunities throughout the land package. Supported by our leading portfolio of operations and projects, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities. Even after the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April and the completion of the GT Gold acquisition, we have $7.6 billion in total liquidity. We have sustained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times, maintaining our financial flexibility whilst we continue to reinvest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. Yesterday, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.55, maintaining an industry-leading dividend yield of over 3.5%. Set within our established framework, our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of both our portfolio and our operating model to generate sustainable long-term value. In June, we published two important ESG focused reports that touch every part of our business and operations. The first was our 17th Annual Sustainability Report, which continues to provide a transparent and detailed look at our ESG performance, focusing on the issues and metrics that matter most to our stakeholders. The second was our first climate strategy report, which focuses on our approach to achieving our science-based climate targets and aligns with reporting guidelines from the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. These reports outline the key sustainability strategies that are embedded in our business and our culture at Newmont. Turning to Slide 5. Newmont is broadly recognized for our robust and disciplined practices when it comes to sustainability reporting, both within our sector and among all corporate reporters. And our long history of taking a leading approach to environmental, social and governance practices has positioned us as the gold sectors recognized sustainability leader. Newmont's strong ESG performance creates long-term value for our stakeholders and drives superior business results through delivering safer, more efficient and reliable operations, greater productivity from well managed resources, the ability to operate effectively in a broad range of jurisdictions, a proactive approach to managing risks and emerging issues and most importantly a reputation built on trust-based relationships and a track record of delivering on our commitments. Earlier this month, we hosted a webcast to provide an overview of our ESG journey. What we have done well, where we have learned lessons and our plans for continued improvement. If you weren’t able to join us, I would invite you to listen to the replay, which is posted on our website. Turning now to Slide 6. Newmont is the world's leading gold producer, with an unmatched portfolio of world-class long-life operations. Among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, we have nine world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years. And we believe that way we choose to operate matters. It is important to note that all of our world-class assets are located in top-tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B rankings ranges, but each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Newmont has the best portfolio of assets located in the most favorable gold mining jurisdictions. That, when coupled with the quality of our people and our integrated operating model, positions us to generate sustainable returns for decades to come. Turning to Slide 7. Our portfolio produced steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through until at least 2030, balanced across each of our four regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Penasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. Moving to Slide 8. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects and lay the pathway to the steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. We continued to advance our mid-term project, including Yanacocha Sulfides, where we’re preparing for a full funds approval in December of this year with a multi-decade mine life that provides exposure to gold, copper and silver. The sulfides project generates profitable production and offers additional upside to extend mine life at this cornerstone asset. We are also executing the second expansion project at Tanami through the development of a 1.6-kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure. This project supports the site's future at a long life and low-cost production and it also provides a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. And as mentioned previously we are pleased to announce that funding for the development of Ahafo North has been approved and this project has now advanced into the execution phase. Turning to the next slide for some details, earlier this month our Board of Directors approved full funding for the Ahafo North project. Expanding our existing footprint in Ghana and adding more than 3 million ounces of gold production over an initial 13-year mine life. Located approximately 30 kilometers north of our existing Ahafo South operations, the Ahafo North project will include four open pit mines and the construction of a standalone mill to produce approximately 300,000 ounces per year at very attractive all-in sustaining costs. The project is expected to deliver an internal rate of return of over 30% at current gold prices. Ahafo North is a significant gold mine by any measure. We have conducted extensive regulatory and community engagements including meetings with traditional leaders and local government agencies and public forums to ensure that we earn and maintain social acceptance throughout Ahafo North lifecycle. We will work to correct lasting value for host communities through enhanced local sourcing and hiring. One key aspect of Ahafo North is our workforce planning, which includes a target to achieve gender parity in the workforce when operations begin. We are very excited about progressing Ahafo North and look forward to bringing you updates as we develop this new mine over the next two years. Turning to Slide 10. The global pandemic has and will continue to challenge all of us for some time to come. And our commitment to protect the health and safety of their workforce and host communities remains our top priority. We believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is critical in combating the spread of the virus. We are encouraging our workforce to get vaccinated as soon as they become eligible and we are working with our local communities and host governments to improve availability and deployment at all of our managed operations. These efforts are supported by our Global Community Support Fund, which is seeking to help with vaccine rollout, vaccine education and awareness campaigns. We are seeing some of the highest vaccination rates in the United States and Canada largely due to the widespread and early availability in these countries. But until the vaccine is available to everyone around the world, our people and operations will continue to be affected by this virus. And recent outbreaks have shown just how difficult this pandemic continues to be, testing our protocols and the resilience of our people and systems. The impacts of the pandemic are also driving cost inflation around the globe. We are now expecting cost escalation of around 3% to 5% for materials, energy and labor. And we expect these pressures to continue through until at least the end of next year. We are currently working on our 2022 business plan, ensuring that the high cost of inflation and the application of a wide ranging controls and safety protocols are built into our assumptions going forward. However despite the impacts from COVID, we remain in line with our guidance ranges. As a reminder, our guidance ranges a plus or minus 5% percent from the midpoints we published in December 2020. We are on track to achieve the midpoint to low end for production and the midpoint to high input costs. Production remains back half weighted for the year with approximately 53% expected in the second half of the year. As a reminder, our cost guidance achieved a $1,200 gold price. At today's gold prices, you can expect an additional $20 to $30 per ounce for production taxes and royalties. As we look ahead towards the second half of this year, we will remain diligent in supporting the vaccination efforts that are so urgently needed around the world. And we encourage everyone to get their vaccine as soon as they are eligible, ensuring that we are all doing our part to end this global pandemic. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob Atkinson for a more detailed look at our global projects and operations. Over to you, Rob.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 12, I'll give an update on our regional performance starting with Africa, Akyem delivered another strong performance during the second quarter as higher ore grades from changes in sequencing largely offset lower tons mined due to challenges with shovel availability. The state is well-positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year expecting to reach its highest production during the fourth quarter. Ahafo continues to be a solid contributor delivering higher grade material from our underground operations to offset unplanned mail maintenance and power outages. At Subika we continued to progress the development of our new underground mining method, sublevel shrinkage and we expect to see steady increases in grade and underground ore tons mined in the second half of the year. In addition we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in quarter three and four positioning Ahafo to deliver a strong finish to 2021. And after finalizing the permitting process with the Canadian EPA our board of directors approved full funding of the Ahafo North project earlier this month. Spending will ramp up in the second half of the year an all critical path equipment orders have been placed in support of initial construction activities to ensure a timely execution of the project. The development of this prolific ore body will leverage our proven operating model with the project and resulting Maine receiving functional and technical support from our existing world-class Ahafo sales operation as we create the next generation of mining in Ghana. Turning to Slide 13 Tanami delivered solid results in the second quarter as higher ore grades more than offset unplanned mill maintenance and longer haul distances from the bottom of the mine. In late June, we detected our first positive COVID case at Tanami. Working closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders, we rapidly made the decision to place the site and care and maintenance beginning on June the 26 to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the health of our workforce and communities right across Australia. I'd like to thank our team in Australia for the rapid response and courageous decision this, during such an extraordinary and dynamic set of circumstances. And I'm proud of the resilience and strength of our workforce as we continue to learn from and manage the impacts and consequences of this virus. Although our second quarter was largely unaffected, we are forecasting a 40,000 to 50,000 homes impact for the remainder of the year as a result of the care and maintenance period. We began ramping up out of care maintenance on July the 13th. And today Tanami mine is now operating at 90%. And despite the impacts from COVID, we continue to advance Tanami mine expansion too. During the second quarter, we progressed the hoist structure and our work on the mine shaft, remaining on track to deliver significant ounce, cost and efficiency improvements in the first half of 2024. Boddington achieved near record quarterly mill performance, reaching nearly 11 million tons process during the second quarter. And we continue to expand the use of the gold industry's first autonomous haul fleet. And today, we are operating 20 trucks in the south pit and we remain on track to deploy the entire fleet of 36 trucks by the end of quarter three. The efficiencies from autonomous haulage coupled with improved performance from the mill will continue to drive performance at Boddington. The improved mill performance helped to offset lower tons mined from ongoing shovel reliability and geotechnical challenges in the South Pit which has the potential to impact our ability to reach as much of the higher grades as we have planned in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 14. Peñasquito delivered another consistent quarter as we continued to execute on our plan full potential enhancements, and the most recent improvements in metal recovery rates will continue to support planned delivery into the future. The work we've done to optimize Peñasquito since we acquired the site in 2019 demonstrates our ability to successfully operate and enhance value at large complex open pit mines. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 as we continued to realize higher than planned tons mined and improve recoveries from the pyrite leach plant. CC&V delivered lower tons mined due to unplanned fleet maintenance and the site continued to experience geochemistry challenges during the second quarter resulting in lower grades and recovery. Mill performance was offset by higher leach pad recoveries and grade improvements are expected during the second half of the year helping to partially overcome some of the challenges experienced in the first and second quarter. At Porcupine Mill an ongoing equipment maintenance has resulted in lower tons mined and processed during the quarter. As we look towards the second half of the year we expect underground development and grades will improve. And last month our full potential program identified 20 initiatives at Porcupine which will deliver efficiency improvements in the coming months. As mentioned previously we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID at Musselwhite. In April, we made the decision to temporarily suspend operations for five days to reduce the spread of the virus resulting in mill stoppages, reduced underground development and more personnel at site in late April and the early May. We expect that these challenges will persist in the second half of the year. And we are continuing our full potential work at Musselwhite focused on increasing development rates and driving productivity. Éléonore delivered another strong quarter as development rates and mill throughput continued to improve over the prior quarter and prior year, offsetting the impact of law personnel that say due to COVID. In addition the site continues to increase the use of teleremote mucking equipment which have helped to increase tons mined and drive important improvements to safety and efficiency. Éléonore will continue to be a solid contributor during 2021 as we expect to sustain consistent production from stable tons mined and process throughout the year. Turning to Slide 15. Despite heavy rainfall in the second quarter, Merian remains a strong performer in the South American region. The site continues to utilize an ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance. And during the second quarter, Merian delivered lower throughput as a site focused on processing harder, higher grade ore. In the second half of the year, Merian will continue to transition from softer satellite to harder raw resulting in higher production from improved grades and steady throughput. Cerro Negro continues to improve productivity and performance as the site continues to manage through the evolving pandemic. During the second quarter, Cerro Negro delivered higher ore grades and During the second quarter Cerro Negro delivered higher ore grades and despite reduced personnel from COVID the site continues to increase or tons mined and processed each quarter. Due to the pandemic Cerro Negro has delivered low development rates over the past year limiting access to higher grade ore in the late 2021 and into 2022. However the site is progressing future growth projects such as the development of San Marcos and the exploration in the Eastern District. Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to the pandemic impacting productivity through the year. Yet despite the challenges from the virus Yanacocha delivered higher grades and recovery from the leach pads in addition to an increase in grade and Quecher Main golden pit. As we look towards the second half of the year Yanacocha will focus on optimal ore placement on the leach pads as the site just transition to which reach only operations ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides. The Yanacocha Sulfides project has the potential to extend Yanacocha’s world-class operations well beyond 2040 adding profitable production from one of the largest and most prolific gold districts in South America for decades to come. And despite potential impacts from the elections in Peru and the impacts of COVID the project is progressing well. The team is focused on critical path activities such as advanced engineering and procurement as we prepare for full funds approval in December of this year. And with that I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16.
Nancy Buese: Thanks Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights Newmont delivered strong performance in the second quarter with over $3 billion in revenue an increase of $700 million with over $3 billion in revenue an increase of $700 million from the prior year quarter driven by higher sales volumes in metal prices. Adjusted net income of $670 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, an increase of over 60% from the prior year quarter and strong free cash flow of $578 million, also an increase of about 50% from Q2 of 2020. Yesterday we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, an increase of $0.30 or a 120% over the prior year quarter. With a yield of over 3.5% at our current share price Newmont is among the top 10% of the S&P’s large cap dividend payers. Turning to Slide 18 to review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $640 million or $0.80 per share. Adjustments included $0.03 related to the unrealized mark-to-market gains on equity investments, $0.02 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments at historical mining sites, $0.02 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account we've reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.83 per diluted share an increase of almost a 160% or $0.51 over the prior year quarter. As a reminder due to our status as a US GAAP filer our adjustments to net income do not include $19 million of incremental costs incurred this quarter as a result of the COVID pandemic. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted an approximately $0.02 of additional net income per share in the second quarter and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we prioritize the health and safety of our workforce and local communities. Turning now to Slide 19, under our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of attributable free cash flow over a five year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow, allowing us to balance steady reinvestment in the business, continued to strengthen our balance sheet and also provide superior shareholder returns to our industry leading dividend framework and opportunistic share buybacks. Turning to Slide 20 for more about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our board evaluating our operational and financial performance and outlook semiannually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. The dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our first quarter dividend calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our second quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in our future outlook and our ability to maintain capital discipline. Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility and returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we delivered on each of these priorities by progressing our profitable reinvestment in the business particularly with the execution of the Tanami Expansion, the approval of Ahafo North and the advancement of Yanacocha Sulfides, investing in exploration with 55 drill rigs working around the globe, completing the GT Gold transaction in May of this year, maintaining our industry-leading dividend established within our framework to provide stable and predictable returns, repurchasing 2.4 million shares translating to approximately $150 million of $1 billion share buyback program and maintaining a strong balance sheet with a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times, giving us the flexibility to reduce our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash and still maintain cash balances of $4.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. The progress we made in the first and second quarter enabled Newmont to return over $1 billion to shareholders in the first half of this year while we continue to reinvest in our business and support our operations with a strong and flexible balance sheet. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy and I'll wrap it up on Slide 23. I'm privileged to lead an organization with a proven track record and a long history of value creation. Capitalizing on the strength of our people, assets and integrated operating model Newmont is well positioned to lead the industry with our commitment to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. As our company moves into its next 100 years, we remain focused on delivering value to all of our stakeholders from our world-class portfolio of long-life responsibly managed assets, located in top tier jurisdictions. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Yeah, thanks. And good morning sort of Tom, Robin, Nancy. Just I guess I had a question on COVID and I know it's probably tough to calculate, but do you have a sense sort of the impact from COVID restrictions on production in Q2? And then just as you look out to the second half, I mean, Rob, you mentioned the impact at Tanami. But are there any other sort of operations just as sort of the Delta variant spreads that you're kind of sort of particularly sort of watching for risks to production?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Tyler. I’ll pass it across to Rob that we are certainly continuing to manage the virus across just about every one of our locations. But Rob, maybe you give a bit of color as you flip around the globe.
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Thanks, Tyler. And if I kind of start off in Australia that obviously the Tanami mine that we had that first positive case and you get two weeks completely shut down. And it takes a little while to ramp up. And Tanami mine has no backup but about 90%. So, it's two weeks plus a few days. But the biggest worry we've got in Australia is that each one of the states and territories have got different rules and regulations and they're not necessarily allowing free travel between the states and the quarantining. And we've obviously got people that work at the different states. So that's a risk moving forward that we're carefully watching and carefully managing in Australia. But really in terms of the biggest area, which we're still worried about to South America is that by far and away that's where we've had the biggest impacts certainly set in agro. We've had several key outbreaks and we've had to shut down several times in the second quarter. But vaccines are starting to get through there and building up in similar Yanacocha that vaccines are coming through. But it's the absenteeism, Tyler, which is the biggest unpredictable thing that you can sometimes have shovel operators away, you can have mill operators away and that causes the biggest challenge. But certainly, with the vaccines in that part of the world that's certainly very positive for us. In terms of Canada, I mentioned about muscle weight that we had that week in April and May where we had to go into care and maintenance, so that that had a significant impact. But again, as each one of the Canadian stays, their level of absenteeism has sometimes been three or four times higher than what we’ve typically had. And that really impacts the development, et cetera. And the key thing that I want to get across is it that the saints are actually managing the situation very, very well. But it is the unpredictability of the virus. And that's the challenge we've got. But with the vaccines coming on, we're certainly very hopeful that will reduce. But it's a very difficult question to actually put your finger on.
Tom Palmer: Tyler, if I build upon that, we will continue to make decisions that put the health and safety of our workforce and local communities front and center. And that kind of my example, it was midnight on a Friday night that positive case came through within two hours that team had made the decision to put their operation in the care and maintenance, have 750 people back in their rooms quarantined and everything safely buttoned up at the mine site and had notified 900 people who had flown home in the previous 48 hours to ensure that they were going into home quarantine and doing the appropriate testing. And we will continue to make those decisions and courageous decisions to ensure health and safety about all else. As we look around how we're managing these impacts with a portfolio of our size with the strength we have of a balanced portfolio around the globe, we believe that we can continue to accommodate these pandemic impacts within the guidance that we provided.
Tyler Langton: All right. That's very helpful. And then just switching to Ahafo North and I know there was just a slight increase in the CapEx with the full funds decision versus the previous guidance. And I’m just trying to get a sense that the current CapEx guide is sort of what level of input cost does that assume? Is it sort of more recent prices for things like user materials and energy? And I guess the same question also for the cost or are you assuming kind of more sort of average prices over the past several years just trying to get a sense sort of the impact that sort of current inflationary trends could potentially have on the CapEx and operating cost here?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Tyler. We certainly and that the slight bump in the capital cost from what we've been guarding previously was looking at current prices and looking at COVID impacts. And we've already placed orders on a number of critical path items, which is really locking up pricing and schedule. And we're doing some of that the Yanacocha Sulfides as well to ensure that we can manage by schedule and cost. So there’s COVID impacts, but also we've already done some work to locking contracts and pricing. So it takes into account on a capital cost of the considerations around current inflation pressures in COVID. And from an operating sense to a couple of years out before that operation comes online, we do expect these inflationary pressures to be cyclical and may well be thrown out the other side of that cycle by the time Ahafo North is up and running and producing.
Tyler Langton: Great. That makes sense. That’s it for me. Thanks so much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tyler.
Operator: The next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi, good morning. Just building on the last question about the COVID impacts. Maybe just remind us where some of the production offsets are coming in the second half of the year? By that I mean, which operations are expected to kind of make up for some of these COVID issues predominantly in South America and Australia? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad, and good morning. The - it’s our needle moving sites really drive here our portfolio movements on a hockey-to-hockey basis. So Peñasquito is pretty flat, it’s having a very solid year, but it's pretty consistent half-on-half, quarter-on-quarter. Boddington, we are - and I was down at Boddington about three weeks ago, watching autonomous haulage in action and spending some time in the south pit and so if I lay back just looking at our work to move down into the high-grade ore. So we are moving into the high-grade ore in the latter part of this year. And Rob talked a bit about the importance of managing some of the geotechnical challenges and some of the equipment reliability challenges are really important. We had that discipline and focus to get to that high-grade ore. So Boddington is a great contributor. Tanami has got some high grade in the latter part of the year. And so I’m very pleased that we're able to navigate through that positive case back up and running very smoothly. And we'll enter into some high grade starts at Tanami in the latter part of the year. And the other one is Ahafo. We've got a stronger second half in Ahafo as we get – certainly, it’s the underground, Subika underground sublevel shrinkage comes on, but also as we get into some high grade ore out of the open pit. So flat for Peñasquito, stronger second half for Boddington and Ahafo and they are the operations that moved the needle.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, that's really clear. Thanks. And my only other question just on the Yanacocha Sulfides as you work towards the full funds decision if there was a situation where your joint venture partner was unable to contribute as much to the funding because of balance sheet issues, et cetera. Would there be appetite from Newmont to maybe consider buying out a larger stake of the project? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: We're very excited about Yanacocha Sulfides, we're very excited about the long life potential of sulfide so sulfide project is built off and the economics have built off the first wave, what we call the first wave which is another live at Yanacocha and third a pit chucky culture underground but there is a second wave and the third wave and the fourth wave of sulfides ore that come after you've installed that processing infrastructure. It's a story that will play out like Carlin did for Newmont from the early to mid-90s and over the last 25, 30 years. So we're very excited about the potential of Yanacocha. We see Yanacocha as a cornerstone asset and a key district that we want to be in for a very long time and its gold and copper which we're very excited about. So we see opportunity when we think about M&A activity we look at where we can consolidate in districts like we did with GT Gold in the Golden Triangle over the earlier part of this year. And certainly if we could consolidate our position at an upgrading asset in a prolific district in around Yanacocha that opportunity presented and we could pick up more of that asset forfeiture value we would be interested.
Operator: The next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC. Please go ahead.
Tom Palmer: Josh we can't hear you. You must be on mute or something. Operator it looks like we might have a connection issue with Josh.
Operator: Yes, we will move on to Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Tom I'm just trying to understand the Boddington commentary because Rob seemed to imply it you wouldn't get to get as this much high-grade in the second half as you just perhaps expected but you still expect production to be up strongly in the year and after the year. Trying to reconcile those two comments?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Greg. So we're moving down into the higher grades in the south pit. So as you move into those higher grades you progressively start to build into higher, higher grades that are coming out of the south pit and obviously feeding into the middle. So you are going to see - we will see a trend of higher production in the second half as you do that. It's really going to be that mind sequence at how much of that high-grade you get by December 31 and how much tips over into January as we move through. So it's going to be a stronger second half because we're entering the high-grade area it's about how many weeks in the six months we get that high-grade material and how much is coming off a medium grade stockpile into a mill that is absolutely humming. So it’s - it will progressively increase and it's just how much that high-grade we can creep into 2021 versus tipping into 2022. And that's what we're very focused on in terms of making sure we stepped down those benches manage the bench hygiene to ensure that we're looking after geotechnical issues. And then we've had some reliability issues with a very large hydraulic shovel both engine issues and very large hydraulic oil pump issues that you wouldn't typically see in these machines. So working with the - and working very closely with the supplier that machine to make sure we get that reliability and maximize the amount of high-grade ore we get did in the second half.
Greg Barnes: Okay. So there's going to be a little less production from Boddington in the second half of the year perhaps as you were previously expecting as well that's what I think I'm hearing?
Tom Palmer: Potentially there's a risk that some tips into the early part of 2021.
Greg Barnes: Yes.
Tom Palmer: But we're - we’ve - we’re still at six months in front of us Greg so we're still very much focused on Newmont and making sure we manage that page turn over very, very carefully, you know that said, I was down there for a period of time about three weeks ago spending, I’ve spent a fair bit of time calming over that shovel. And in that pit with a mining team just understanding how they're working their way through that.
Greg Barnes: And some of your comments about inflationary pressures in the second half of the year into 2022, I think that's a bit of a change from perhaps what you were saying at the beginning of the year where I don't think you're seeing much impact from those cost pressures, but now it does appear to be coming through. Where is it coming through from?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Greg. It is as we, as we sit, as we've been sitting there right in the middle of our business planning process now. So as we, as a global supply chain team then starts to look at some of those, those trends, we are seeing across, I mean 50% of our case is labor. And we are seeing both in Canada and Australia quite hot labor markets for mining. And so we are seeing that has been an uptick certainly, certainly in both those countries over the course of this year. And we expect to see that flow through at least all of next year. And then materials and energy make up the next 40% to 45%, so across labor materials and energy, you’ve got, you've got our cost base. And we are saying in terms of steel and fuel and oils as we pull together out, our plans work with us various suppliers that uptick and it bundled all together, aggregate it all together, we're seeing the order of about that 5%, or 5%. We're seeing it not structural. We are seeing it is cyclical. So what we are seeing that buying through and considering that that will play our, for at least all of 2022 and starting to factor that into our planning process. We've got our continuous improvement program full potential which is very mature but we are leaning in too hard to look for we can offset some of those headwinds. But we certainly are seeing that inflation trend. And of course it does set us up nicely for some pretty positive gold profit outlook as we're seeing that. But we're pulling together the detailed analysis for our business plan that we are seeing as trends flow through.
Greg Barnes: Okay. So likely upward pressure on 2022 to cost guidance?
Tom Palmer: That’s right, Greg. And as we see the midstream in our planning process, looking at about that around about that 5% aggregated number.
Operator: The next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jackie Przybylowski: I guess I'll just to follow on Greg's question on inflation. So you’re kind of warning that you're expecting to see inflation on the operating cost side. And it sounds like maybe on the capital cost side too where things like steel. But your guidance is more or less unchanged I guess. It looks like there's a few areas at least in 2021 on both development and sustaining CapEx expense or we've actually seen it go down by a little bit. And it looks like also maybe in 2023 with development CapEx, so how should we be thinking about the guidance? Is this something that I mean did you have several wiggle room built into it that the inflation is just sort of filling in? Or is there any risk that we might see either your CapEx or your OpEx guidance go up by subsequent quarters by year-end? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie. So for 2021, we’re certainly seeing on the cost side somewhere between midpoint in the high-end so that high-end is plus-5%. So we’re high-end plus 5%. So, we're going to track some way within it, so we as we stated I am looking at some of those inflationary pressures, so that we can and will accommodate our costs this year. Within that, certainly as we look at 2022 and now and update our long-term guidance in December, we're certainly saying that cost pressure I was just talking with Greg about. And on the development capital side, we have built with the Tanami and we've built into the Ahafo North. Our understanding of where cost is and that's accommodated within the outlook we've given for both of those projects. We are continuing to de-risk Yanacocha Sulfides, where we're on critical path. We are getting - surely we get factory slots and prices for some different critical path items for instance oxygen plants and the like. So, we're making sure we're managing that process ahead of a full funds decision, so that when they come out with a hopefully full funds decision in December that what we've gone to is accommodating some of those capital cost inflationary pressures. And then on the development capital side as we guide outside left the inflationary pressures more the sequence of those projects as you've got a different COVID impacts. How is the spend profile looking for a half a north and Yanacocha Sulfides then a Tanami is more going to be the influence of our development capital number in 2022 versus 2023 versus 2024.
Jackie Przybylowski: All right. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Thank you for clarifying that. Maybe I'll just follow-up with the point on Yanacocha Sulfides and Tom I know you've been asked this 100 times probably already, but with the changes improve, with the recent election and it looks like the formal signing into Castillo. Is there anything that you could see between now and December that would make you pause on sanctioning Yanacocha Sulfides or independent of the project itself? I'm talking more about the political or regulatory environment. Is there anything that would worry you or are you fairly confident that you'd be able to manage that in whatever environment you're in?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Jackie. It's certainly I think a very important step in the declaration of President, Castillo. Next step for us will be to see how he assembles his cabinet and then make - we know who we can engage with and understand that we're about to embark upon a couple of billion dollar investment in their country. I think it’s clear that they acknowledge the importance of mining to Peru's economy and a country that's probably the worst hit from the pandemic around the world. And so the opportunity to have an investment into the mining industry that's going to help the Peruvian economy, I'm optimistic that discussion will be well-received as we can start engaging with the new cabinet. We've been in Peru for 30 years. Yanacocha Sulfides will position us to be in Peru for at least another 30 or 40 years. So we are taking a very long-term view on this decision, but pleased to see that we've got our decision in the election, which will allow us then to start engaging over the next six months with some of those key leaders in government.
Operator: The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. Just maybe coming up to Rob or Tom, I just wanted to follow back on just wanted to follow back on to this inflation question, appreciate the 3% to 5% and you mentioned labor in Canada and Australia, I just want to dig deeper if there is any aspects of labor that you’re seeing a much higher I mean inflationary pressures on this underground miners, I’m just trying to understand if there is pockets of that that’s occurring that you’re seeing?
Tom Palmer: Yes and good morning, Tanya. Thank you for the question. We are certainly seeing in Canada high demand for creek technical staff. A number of projects around the country and then say you starting to see that mobility of folks moving on to different opportunities. And we're seeing that that impact in terms of operators and maintainers for the mine, again in particularly when you got the fly in and fly out operations that that ease being able to switch from one plant to another. So we are seeing those pressures in a heating up market in Canada and very similar in Western Australia where you've got a very significant boom happening on the back of record iron ore prices, so very high demand both in the construction of the expansions to or as the expansions those iron ore mines to maintain throughput high demand for operators, maintainers and technical people. So professionals in an environment that Rob was talking about earlier where the state governments the provincial governments in Australia are constantly opening closing borders. And so there's a real push on to the employing out of the state, so that you've got that reliability you stop being within state. And we’re likely to have in Australia those interstate pressures or still some time to come given their slow take up of the vaccination, which is certainly they're paying the price full now with the delta strain of the virus. One of the things that we’re doing which is going to significantly offset the pressure on operators in particular is the implementation of autonomous haulage at Boddington. If you think about our fleet of 36 trucks across four ships and then the additional numbers of people you have to cover a ship breaks manually and those sorts of things. You're talking of the order of the 180 people that are no longer needed to drive trucks because they're running autonomously, and that takes some pressure out of the system in terms of labor pressure for operators and maintainers. But it's lots of projects in both of those countries and limited supply and by professionals and operators in maintenance. Robert do you have anything you could add?
Rob Atkinson: I think the only thing that I would add Tom is Tanya that it also applies to contractors where maintenance shuts that there is such demand competing priorities. And as Tom said if you're trying to do a major shift in Western Australia and you're limited to contractors there sometimes you can't do all the work you need to. And as such you've got to do the fair work et cetera. And similar to what Tom said in Canada we've also seen exploration contractors also lift their prices as well. So those are definitely the two toughest in the autos markets.
Tanya Jakusconek: And then maybe if I can get a bit of clarity on material energy. I understand but just some material are you just seeing it in steel is it cement is it cyanide? Maybe just a little bit more clarity exactly in the materials side?
Tom Palmer: Yes it predominantly is steel that we're seeing it come through on the materials side. And what we'd also tuck-in underneath materials and when we think about that element of our so as particularly as we’ve got concentrate we're moving out of Peñasquito and Boddington. We are seeing freight costs increase so that will be the two materials areas that we're seeing that pressure.
Tanya Jakusconek: And then just on two other assets that we didn't touch on or maybe well Boddington we did a little bit. Can you just remind me of what exactly the geo technical issue is in the pit?
Tom Palmer: Rob do you want to pick that one up as we bring our benches down.
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Tanya it's quite a seasonal issue there as well is with Australia. And that part of the world tends to get quite heavy rain. And when you've got heavy rain, there's always the risk to the walls where we stand off a little bit further. And that's something which we've been managing very, very carefully. So it's things as practical as that. And just for a piece of information this month of July has been some of the record rainfalls in Australia. So we've just had to stand off the walls a little bit further. And that causes a slight slowdown in the charts.
Tom Palmer: And just making sure you're keeping a catch benches clear which is stepping down. So we’re starting to see because of some of that that weather I mean if you remember in that Boddington pit Tanya when you were there a few years ago, it’s quite a fractious material. So it's making sure you've got those places clean, you keeping your catch benches clean and making sure you've got that hygiene which is stepping down, so you’re not creating problems for yourself into the future because you're not looking after you've bench hygiene.
Tanya Jakusconek: And then just on the Goldstrike Roaster. I don't know if Rob can share with us the impact of that roaster, portion of the roaster being down for Q3? What that would be as an impact to you like you gave us for Tanami?
Tom Palmer: Sure. And Rob’s in regular, Rob and Greg would talk every week, for every couple of weeks. So it's the mill feeding the roster and it's the slippery on the mill that's had the fire and is being replaced. And Rob, you might give a bit of color and my understanding of the impact from an NGM perspective.
Rob Atkinson: Yes. Certainly, Tanya. It’s obviously, it has been a major failure when down end of May. We're expecting it to come up sometime in September. What the team at NGM has been able to do is run a different type of feed there whether it's the high carbon materials to make sure that there's still material that were going through that particular mill. But in terms of the impact when we look at the roster and also some of the challenges that are occurring at Turquoise Ridge we're looking at for Newmont about 40,000 ounce impact.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. That's helpful.
Tom Palmer: Sorry Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: That and Q3 for your share.
Tom Palmer: For the second half - for rest of the year.
Rob Atkinson: For the rest of the year.
Tanya Jakusconek: Rest of the year. Okay and...
Tom Palmer: Rob and I are also hitting up to across to Alcoa on Sunday's for our quarterly board meeting. So we'll get a chance to have a bit of a look-see as well.
Tanya Jakusconek: And if I could just squeeze one more and just on the status of the illegal miners that are going on in Ghana maybe what's happening there?
Tom Palmer: Yes, Rob or Steve. We’ve got Steve Gottesfeld here as well. So Rob or Steve why don't you take that one?
Rob Atkinson: Okay. I'll kick off, Steve. And Tanya, one of the key things to see is it’s year-to-date, there has actually been quite a remarkable turnaround there in terms of actually onsite. The presence of the illegal miners on the site has been managed particularly well that the Guinean authorities are working closely with us to make sure that we're not only targeting the illegal miners, but also where the gold is getting processed is also getting sold. And the response from the Guinean authorities has been first class. At the same time, we've increased our intelligence, our monitoring, our response et cetera. So in many ways, the way in which we are managing, what we can manage on site is actually going quite well with a clear partnership with the Guinean authorities. There has obviously been some issues offsite and perhaps Steve if you want to just talk about that.
Stephen Gottesfeld: Sure. So, I guess I would just add that as Rob is saying we obviously rely on the government authority to provide security as well as having our own security. As you know, we're committed to the voluntary principles on security and human rights. Those trainings are always ongoing. In this particular case, there were several dozen individuals who clearly were intent on conducting illegal mining activities and the government needed to engage in protective action. We have a robust ASM program. We focus on maximizing local hiring, local procurement and alternative livelihood work. We'll continue to do that, partner as closely as we can with the government and also the local stakeholders and traditional authorities who after all are the owners of the land. And we believe that the steps been taken will calm the situation now. But we're watching it very carefully.
Operator: The next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: So, the question I guess is a, just a little bit more on the input cost or the inflationary pressures that you're seeing. So as I look at the guidance you said you would be midpoint to top end of the guidance range in the plus or minus 5% so far year-to-date you've hit the middle of that range. So is that could say the second half of the year could be on the plus 5% or higher from second half cost this year?
Tom Palmer: Yes, one of the things to monitor without cost guidance as we guided $1,200 gold price. And so when you see our year-to-date actual costs they include production taxes and royalties of some $20 to $30 an ounce because we've been up at around $1,800. So it's factoring - it's factoring in that $20 to $30 assuming gold price stays at current levels will continue to flow through and our actual costs going forward.
Anita Soni: Okay. I'm not sure if that made it better or worse. But let me think about that. The second question I guess would be around the moving to the second half of the year oh sorry moving into 2022 thinking about the guidance will be given on costs. So if I'm going to summarize all the commentary? I think you're basically saying development costs are encapsulated already in the two guides you've given for the two projects as they stand for Ahafo North and Tanami. And then secondly sustaining costs and operating costs you're seeing a 3% to 5% increase and that includes I guess all kinds of input and labor escalation. Does it include COVID impacts as well?
Rob Atkinson: Yes, yes so we are - and we are building our plants now [native] but we are incorporating. We do expect those COVID protocols and costs to continue into next year. So we are building assumptions around those into our cost as we build our plant and that when I talk that 3% to 5% that's including any provisions we might for them.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then as you mentioned then at $1,200 gold so, is there any thought to increasing that, that number for next year so that when we - look at this chart next year with those royalties that are captured with a higher gold price?
Tom Palmer: We certainly, we’re certainly maintaining our discipline internally with our business plan to build at that $1,200 assumption to ensure we've got the robustness and that discipline in our culture. And we're debating at the moment how we think about providing our cost guidance and actually whether we maintain an assumption on a $1,200 revenue gold price or whether we were to, try to do some other numbers. So, we're considering that as we, as we pull together our numbers. Nancy, did you want to make a comment?
Nancy Buese: Yes, Anita I would also add, we will continue to provide you with sensitivities around all the important drivers. So, even at a $1,200 gold price, you'll be able to articulate and make good assumptions about different gold prices and output. So, for example, the comment that Tom made on the taxes and royalties about that price is higher than $1,200. We will continue to guide clarity around those so you can get a better picture even at the $1,200 level.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Parkin of National Bank. Please go ahead.
Mike Parkin: Thanks for taking my questions. I think Peru, there certainly seems to be a fair bit of issue not specific to Yanacocha, but to just the mining industry in general about kind of a lack of investment and flow of moneys earned back into local communities? Can you give us some color in terms of what your stakeholder engagement has been like with your local communities that are impacted by Yanacocha and what if anything you're kind of planning to do differently if you do go ahead with the full funds decision on the sulphide project?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Mike, great question and I’ll pass it across to Steve Gottesfeld to give you some color in terms of some of the aspects of the work we're doing there.
Stephen Gottesfeld: Thanks Tom, and thank you Mike for the question. Yes I think, as you know mining is a pillar and a core really a cornerstone for the Peruvian economy. And we've been there for well over three decades now. And our relationship with [Cajamarca] has really improved over the years. Obviously - Yanacocha is a huge presence in Cajamarca and our community has grown substantially over time. There have been challenges for sure with regard to delivery of value coming from the Central Government in the form of taxes as to where that money gets distributed. And over time they've with different administrations, you've seen more or less funds come back into the region. Obviously we value through extensive employment local hiring, local content. And I would say honestly that as hard hit as Peru and Cajamarca have been in this COVID pandemic environment our relationship has really strengthened during this period of time. In fact, we just had a vaccination clinic open up in our offices in Cajamarca and I believe it's the only mining company that's been able to do that in Peru to date. So our intention certainly is and has been to focus on the value provided to our stakeholders in Cajamarca our relationship not only with the many communities around our operation, but also with the regional government continues to strengthen. Our intention would be throughout this process to continue to work with them to find ways especially as we look at moving forward with sulfides in maximizing our value. Certainly we'd want to partner with the central government on determining how to best provide a return of those dollars back into the community and I'd also encourage you to take a look at our sustainability report on the programs that we have more broadly in Cajamarca and the efforts we've made in the economic contribution that's occurring.
Mike Parkin: All right no thanks for that. And one other one just mentioning how freight is weighing on the inflation can you - are you seeing any major challenges with access to securing container availability. Reading a few reports out there saying that's becoming quite a challenge. Is that something that's impacting either the movement of concentrate or for supplies into sites or whatever color you can kind of provide would be appreciated?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Mike. We're not seeing any impact on that perspective around freight.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. And please as this virus continues to play out stay safe and healthy and look after your families. Thanks everyone.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Colby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Eric Colby: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Today on the call today we have Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of the executive team. Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. I'll turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the 12 colleagues that we've lost to the COVID pandemic over this last year. For each death, we've mobilized investigation team and utilized the same methodology we do for other employee, who contract to fatalities. The intent of each investigation was to understand if any of that COVID controls require change and ensuring that we learn and share our findings globally. These losses have had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family. And it is with great humility that we're reminded that the safety and wellbeing of our workforce and health communities must come above all else. Turning to Slide 4, for a summary of our quarterly performance. The safety and sustainability framework is at the core of how we manage our business and I'm proud that Newmont continues to lead the industry with our ESG practices. In March, we delivered first for gold industry with production coming from an autonomous haul fleet. Our investment in autonomous haul trucks not only improves safety and productivity at Boddington. But also serves as a best case for replication at other operations and projects across the Newmont portfolio. We also entered into a $3 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility one of the first in the mining industry. By aligning our financial strategies and ESG performance we're holding ourselves accountable and demonstrating Newmont's unwavering commitment to leading the ESG practices. During the first quarter, our world class portfolio produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and 317,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc. In line with our full year outlook and positioning Newmont to deliver a stronger performance as expected in the second half of the year. We generated significant operating cash flow of $841 million and free cash flow of $442 million of which $438 million is attributable to Newmont. And in March, we announced the acquisition of GT Gold expanding our industry leading project pipeline to include the Tatogga project located in the highly sought after Golden Triangle district of British Columbia. We continue to apply a disciplined approach to our capital allocation priorities and deliver on our commitments. Yesterday, we declared first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share set within our established dividend framework and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our first quarter dividend demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our business and continued commitment to predictable, stable and sustainable shareholder returns. We maintained a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.2 times and completed the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April, reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash. We also continued to invest in and develop our most profitable near-term projects including Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, the mining method change at Subika Underground and Yanacocha Sulfides. Shifting now to safety and our continued focus on fatality prevention on Slide 5. More than a year ago, Newmont made a symbolic change stepping away from our industry's traditional use of lagging personal injury rate in our bonus programs to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. During the first quarter, we completed 65,000 conversations by leaders in the field that were focused on these critical controls. So actively identifying and managing potential risks that could lead to a fatality. This is an increase of nearly 60% since last quarter and demonstrates our commitment to the preventative measures we're implementing at Newmont. As another example, fatigue has been identified as a critical risk and is frequently a factor in our investigations into potentially fatal events. Fatigue has not been a traditional focus in our industry. Typically, it has been managed through administrative control such as training and checklist. Well companies have looked to technology as a silver bullet to address the issue. But in an organization level, we knew we needed to do more. We needed to make fundamental changes to our rosters, staff times and accommodation to reduce this significant risk exposure. We've recently completed the construction of new camp facilities as part of our Tanami 2 Expansion. These facilities were designed to provide the opportunity for quality sleep and to greatly reduce commute times for our team members. We have also completed upgrades to camp facility at Yanacocha, Peñasquito, Cerro Negro and Merian ensuring that our team members have the appropriate facility and accommodation to get proper sleep. As a result of these investments in our camp facilities along with our well-being programs around our global portfolio. We have seen an 80% reduction in fatigue related incidents at Newmont since 2019. We will continue to make these changes to ensure that our team members can return home safely to their families at the end of their shift at work. Turning now to our portfolio on Slide 6, 12 operating mines and two joint ventures. We have nine world class assets each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year and all-in sustaining cost of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life exceeding 10 years. Importantly all allocated in top-tier jurisdictions. But redefined as countries classified in the IMD [ph] rating range by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Underpinning our asset base, are the industry's largest gold reserves including 94 million ounces of gold and 65 million equivalent ounces from other metals. Our portfolio is also enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of both greenfield and brownfield opportunities, managed through our proven integrated operating model. One of the benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate ever. For example, with the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations. We have similarity not only with the geology and terrain. But also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations. We firmly believe that we have the best portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world class responsibly managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions. Turning to Slide 7, our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces per year through at least 2030 balanced across each of our four regions. This profile has been further enhanced by the production of more than $1 million equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade. The most of any company in our industry. Moving to Slide 8, for a look at our project pipeline. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects at later pathways to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040s. as you can see, in addition to our highly perspective gold projects we have significant organic exposure to gold, copper [indiscernible] including Norte Abierto, Nueva Unión and Galore Creek. In fact, if you assume that just one of these three mega projects have been to our production profile at the back end of this decade Newmont's total production would be around 15% to 20% copper providing us a natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the ongoing transition to a new energy economy. It's also important to note that this pipeline does not include the various laybacks that will also extend mine life at our current open pit operations including a NGM, CC&V and Porcupine. You will also see that we've added Tatogga to our project pipeline another exciting gold copper asset that I'll cover in more detail on Slide 9. In March, we announced the acquisition of GT Gold. The consolidation of this asset is a demonstration of Newmont's clear focus on our long-term strategy to build a portfolio of world class assets located in the world's best mining jurisdictions. Our initial equity investment in GT Gold in 2019 was a stepping stone that enabled us to perform due diligence in the area and gain considerable insight into the potential of the Saddle North deposit and Tatogga property. We're committed to continue building a constructive and respectful relationship with the Tahltan Nation including the community at Iskut. We understand and acknowledge the Tahltan consent is necessary for advancing the Tatogga project and we will partner with the Tahltan Nation at all levels and with the Government of British Columbia to ensure a shared path forward. The deposit will be developed as an underground mine with a block cave mining method and in addition access from the belly floor that you can see in this picture will also enable us to reach the ore body relatively quickly. A very important feature of this project is at the combination of an underground mine and the ability to leverage the hybrid power infrastructure that's in place today will result in a low carbon intensity operation, supporting our industry leading greenhouse gas reduction targets. The Tatogga project including the primary Saddle North deposit has the potential to contribute significant gold and copper annual production at attractive all-in sustaining cost over a long mine life. In addition to the known deposits of Saddle North, there are further exploration opportunities throughout the land package. The acquisition of Tatogga adds to Newmont's existing interest in this area and build on a 50% ownership in the Galore Creek project. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and we look forward to providing updates on this highly perspective project in the future. With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 10.
Rob Atkinson: Before I start, I'd like to recognize the very significant efforts that continue to be applying at all of our operations in order to manage COVID and to keep our team safe and healthy. It is important to realize that this pandemic has some way to run and these efforts will need to continue from many months to come. Turning to Slide 11, I'll give an update on Africa's performance. Our assets in Africa delivered another strong performance in the first quarter and team maintained its momentum from quarter four delivering a strong first quarter from higher grade and improvements to the middle. We increased mill efficiency and overall planned performance during the first quarter, improving throughput by 3% whilst also reducing energy consumption by 4%. These improvements are driven by full potential projects and are an example of how we continue to find elevated solutions even at our matured operations. The site is well positioned to deliver solid production throughout the year, expecting to reach its highest production and lowest cost during the fourth quarter. Ahafo delivered higher stoppage tons due to mine sequencing improvements that resulted in an extra bench being mined at Awonsu, helping to offset lower grade during the first quarter. We continue to progress the development of our new mining method at Subika, sub-level shrinkage which will increase tonnage improved productivities and reduce mining cost. The team has commenced stopping ahead of schedule and we completed our first two ore blast this month a major milestone for the project. As the sub-level shrinkage project progresses during 2021, we expect to see improvements in grade throughout the year and a 50% increase in ore tones, mining by the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to reach higher ore grades from the open pit operations in the second half of the year positioning Ahafo to deliver a very strong finish to 2021. Finally, at Ahafo North we continue to advance the permitting process with EPA. I'm pleased to announced that we've completed the environment's impact study and paid the invoice for the impairment this month. Putting us on track for full month's decision in July of this year after the receipt of the [indiscernible]. All other aspects of this project are proceeding well. Turning to South America on Slide 12, South America has been the region most impacted by the virus and we continue to see the more significant impacts in Argentina and Peru. We remain focused on the safety protocols to protect the health and well-being of our workforce and communities as we continue to mitigate the impacts of travel restrictions caused by the virus. We do expect to impact due to COVID to continue for some time until vaccinations are available and being administered in large quantities. Merian was the best performing asset in South America despite heavy rainfall during the first quarter which impacted productivity in the mine. The team continued to utilize ore blending strategy to optimize mill performance resulting in an increased tons process whilst maintaining stable grades. As the year progresses, Merian will transition from softer saprolite to harder ore, which will result in higher production through improved grades. But will be partially offset by lower mill throughput. And Cerro Negro will continue to work closely with government representatives and other key stakeholders as we manage our operations through the evolving pandemic. As we reviewed the number of COVID cases in the country and the increasing case numbers at our old site. We made a decision to temper hours, suspend operations for five days in January and seven days in March to reduce the spread of the virus. While these decisions impact first quarter production the health and safety of our workforce remains our first priority and despite stoppages during the quarter, we've been able to resume development at San Marcos and make good progress on the tailings storage to facilities expansion. Cerro Negro continues to focus on safely ramping up site activities, increasing camp capacity and appointing a new dedicated team to optimize the important and complex shift changes. Yanacocha has also experienced significant challenges due to COVID and due to the pandemic productivity will likely be impacted throughout the year. Despite the challenges from the virus, Yanacocha delivered higher grade material mine from Yanacocha maine [indiscernible] pits. These tons replaced on leach-plants during quarter which we expect to result in higher production in future quarters. In February, we decommissioned the old site mill and completed our transition to leach-only operations as planned ahead of the developments of Yanacocha Sulfides which will extend Yanacocha's operations well beyond 2040 [ph]. We continue to advance the sulfides project. I can't be walking through our internal peer review process in preparation for full funds approval later in the second half of 2021. Yanacocha is a world class asset in Newmont's portfolio with significant product prospectivity [ph] and we look forward to bringing you this next chapter in Yanacocha's long history of profitable production. Coming to North America, Slide 13. Peñasquito delivered another strong performance and achieved record core product sales of nearly 300,000 gold equivalent ounces in the first quarter due to higher grades and recoveries. The site also set a new monthly record for concentrate transport and shipping, rolling and selling over 125,000 tons in March. Full potential continues to deliver improvements to our mining and no performance at Peñasquito. And as an example, we've increased the average payroll for our whole trucks by 17 tons per load. This translates to an additional 12 million tons moved per year for next to zero cost, an increase of over 6%. The site is well positioned to remain a strong performer throughout 2021 and is also currently exploring our extensive line package of Q2 development opportunities. CC&V delivered lower grade and experienced geochemistry challenges during the first quarter and as a result, ore that was planned to be milled was redirected to the leach pads. Drilling improvements are expected during the second half of the year helping the offset the challenges experienced this quarter. At Musselwhite, we continue to closely monitor the impacts from COVID in Ontario and have made a decision to temporarily suspend operations for five days in April to reduce the spread of the virus. Despite the impacts from COVID which draw changes to the plan mining sequence, grade and ore tons mining continued to improve over the prior quarter. We're also continuing our full potential at Musselwhite with the largest focus on increasing development base and driving productivity as the year progresses. At Porcupine, ongoing ground control rehabilitation in the Hoyle and underground mining coupled with mill and equipment maintenance has resulted in more tons mined and processed during the quarter. We have begun the implementation of our full potential program at Porcupine which will deliver efficiency improvements in the second half of the year. Éléonore continues to make strong improvements to performance and productivity increasing underground development rates to an average of 40 meters per day by the end of the first quarter. This is an improvement of 25% from 2020. In addition the safest way, tele-remote mucking equipment for the first time, increasing tons mine, efficiencies and safety of our workforce. Éléonore will continue to be a stable contributor during 2021 as we expected to deliver steady production increases from higher tons mine and process through the year. It's also important to note, that the site is making good progress in the fight against COVID. I'm pleased to report that 70% of Éléonore workforce has been vaccinated so far. Turning to Australia on Slide 14. Tanami delivered a consistent performance despite heavy rainfall increasing ore tons mined during the quarter. For the rest of 2021, we will continue to monitor impacts of COVID on the Northern territory due to the potential closure state and territory borders. But we expect that production will steadily increase grades improves throughout the year. In addition, the team continues to advance Tanami Expansion 2 supporting the sites future as a long life, low cost and very efficient producer. We recently completed construction of the camp facilities and the excavation of the upper section of the production shaft putting us on track to deliver significant ounces, cost and efficiency improvement in the first half of 2024. At Boddington, we delivered a solid quarter in line with our expectations and full year guidance. Mine maintenance was completed during the first quarter ensuring the plant continues to perform at high levels. As we get into the second half of the year, as highlighted in our previous guidance. We expect to achieve higher grades, improved throughput and increased ore tons made due to efficiency from Autonomous Haulage and improved mill processing. As you can see in the picture, we are well in our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine with an Autonomous truckload and I will provide more details in the project on Slide 15. I'm pleased to announce that the first Boddington AHS haul trucks went live in the March of this year and we've successfully started the first phase of our transition to fully autonomous haulage fleet which will improve safety and extend mine line as one of our core assets. Today, we're operating four trucks hauling ore from stockpiles to the crusher and four additional trucks completing the final testing. We expect to expand the use of autonomous units in the pit during the second quarter, deploying the entire fleet 36 trucks by the end of September. As a reminder, the AHS project was approved in February of 2020 meaning the project was planned, constructed and be able to achieve first production in just over a year. Being on track to deliver this project on time and on budget will be a huge accomplishment especially during the global pandemic and I'd like to thank our team at Boddington and our partners at Caterpillar including their dealership WesTrac. All the overgrowing dedication and drive during such an unprecedented time. We've received very strong support from Caterpillar through the project and we look forward to working together on future endeavors. In addition to the exceptional delivery at this project, we have already seen strong performance over the last month from these machines and the operating team. The fleet has been running non-stop since going live in March to eliminating stoppages from shift changes, meal and toilet brakes, tea breaks which increases its productivity and already the new vehicles have the first major milestone moving over 1 million tons in less than six weeks. It's also worth noting the significant productivity improvements that we'll achieve with this fleet will also translate to lower fuel cost and consumption. Reducing our carbon emissions at Boddington and supporting Newmont's climate initiatives. But most importantly, the use of these Autonomous trucks reduces the exposure that our workforce has to potential vehicle interaction, helping us to further reduce fatality risk and to ensure that our team members return home safely at the end of the shift at work. The implementation at the industry's first autonomous haulage fleet will be a major milestone from Newmont and the gold industry as a whole. We will look to replicate this technology, training and experience at other sites around the globe leveraging our team of experts and lessons around Boddington and we will also look to integrate further autonomous solutions both at future open pit and underground mine, as we plan and develop the assets in our project pipeline, ensuring that these important improvements to safety and productivity are applied across the global business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 16.
Nancy Buese: Thanks Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. During the first quarter, Newmont delivered solid results with $2.9 billion in revenue an increase of nearly $300 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher metal prices. Adjusted net income of $594 million or $0.74 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.5 billion an increase of 30% from the prior year quarter. A strong free cash flow of $442 million which includes unfavorable working capital changes of over $325 million in the first quarter primarily driven by nearly $400 million of tax payments attributable to 2020. We declared a first quarter dividend of $0.55 per share or $2.20 per share on an annual basis. Demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainable returns and consistent with our fourth quarter dividend. Our dividend puts Newmont in the top quartile of the S&P large cap dividend payers and provides the yields of approximately 3.5% on our current share price. Turning to Slide 18 for review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $538 million or $0.67 per share. Adjustments included $0.14 related to the unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments measured as of March 31st. $0.05 primarily related to our sale of interest, our interest in TIMAC, which closed in January of this year. $0.01 related to reclamation, remediation adjustments at historical mining sites. And $0.03 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance. Taking these adjustments into account we recorded first quarter adjusted net income of $0.74 per diluted, an increase of $0.34 over the prior year quarter. One difference from 2020 that we would like to point out is that adjustments to net income do not include $21 million of incremental COVID costs. Adjusting for these costs would have resulted in $0.02 of additional net income in the first quarter and we expect these costs to continue throughout the year as we protect against the impact of the pandemic at our operational sites. Turning now to Slide 19, using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption Newmont expects to generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow over five-year period. In addition, for every $100 increase in gold prices about our base assumption. Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Newmont is the only company in the gold mining industry with the ability to generate these levels of attributable free cash flow. Enabling us to maintain flexibility in our balance sheet for debt repayments and opportunistic M&A. in addition to providing industry leading shareholder return. Turning to Slide 20 for more details about our dividend. Our dividend framework provides shareholders with stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price. Along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental attributable free cash flow generated at gold prices above our plan. This range provides Newmont with the flexibility to maintain a stable and consistent dividend payout even when there is fluctuation in gold price. We will continue to review our dividend each quarter with management and our board evaluating gold prices in Newmont projected performance semi-annually to give us maximum flexibility in determining our dividend within the framework. The first quarter dividend declared yesterday was consistent with our fourth quarter dividend, calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a conservative 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow. Our dividend framework continues to be our primary vehicle for returning cash to our investors and Newmont continues to lead the industry with shareholder return, delivering $4.50 per share through dividends and share buybacks since 2019. Turning to Slide 21. We continue to drive the business with our clear capital allocation priorities which include reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects. Returning cash to shareholders and maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. During the first quarter we delivered on each of these priorities with our investments in the first Autonomous Haulage fleet in the gold mining industry and improving safety and productivity at Boddington. Progressing our profitable reinvestments in the business at the Tanami Expansion and advancing Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides. Announcing the acquisition of GT Gold, maintaining our industry leading dividend of $2.20 per share on an annualized basis and announcing a new $1 billion share buyback program. We chose not to repurchase shares during the first quarter and continue to monitor for opportunities. Maintaining a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times [ph] and completing the redemption of our 2021 senior notes in April. Reducing our debt outstanding by $550 million with available cash and maintaining financial flexibility with the completion of the $3 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. One of the first in our industry and a demonstration of our commitment to leading ESG practices. Under the new facility the company will incur pricing adjustments on drawn balances based on sustainability performance criteria measured through ratings published by MSCI and S&P Global. Aligning our financial strategies and our ESG performance. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong results and free cash flow to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation. With that, I'll hand it back to Tom on Slide 22.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Nancy and turning to Slide 23. Newmont continues to be the world's leading gold company. And I'm confident that our world class portfolio and robust project pipeline have positioned Newmont to deliver on our commitment of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator and open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] and your first question will come from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: First it sounds like across the portfolio consistent theme is second half weighted production. But I'm trying to figure out how much of that is sequencing and grade improvement and how much of it is some of the South American COVID issue that you mentioned and also the Musselwhite COVID issue that you mentioned. So any color there would be helpful, grades versus kind of COVID impacting the first half.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Fahad. Good morning. The little moments in our portfolios are Ahafo, Boddington and Peñasquito. Peñasquito on gold production is pretty flat through the 12 months roughly 50-50 first half and second half. But it's going to really move the dial in the second half, this mine sequencing and grade at both Boddington and Ahafo. So Boddington we're being lying back for the fifth buyback of the south pit in Boddington, Ahafo, three and half years in the second half. We get access to the high grade gold and copper and the benefit of the top most haulage which should be fully implemented by the second half. So to see that flow through I think in the second half a significant high grade. And at Ahafo, the combination of the new underground mining method coupled with shrinkage will bring through more volume and improved grade and then you've got improved grade from the Subika open pit as well. So it's largely mine sequence and grade driven and it's those three operations that really will deliver on that second half performance.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, great. That's clear and just my second question. There was a media article this talking about the GT Gold at Tatogga project and the local indigenous groups perhaps are not really being open to the project. Maybe talk about your approach there more specifics and like historically what levers has Newmont used to kind of get that buy in. thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Fahad. So our relationship with the Tahltan actually started several years ago with our acquisition 50% of Galore Creek project in that part of British Columbia. So we have established relationships that we look to grow, build on with the whole representatives of the Tahltan Nation and when you look back at our long history of social responsibility it is very much founded on building those relationships, understanding issues of concerns of how we can work together. So we fully understand, we fully acknowledge that we'll need Tahltan consent to advance that project and we'll be endeavoring to work with them respectfully and engage with the relationship of those various communities to find their shared pathway forward and that is very much the approach the Newmont takes with everywhere we're working in the North.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tyler Langton of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Just start with sort of through and again, of course I guess there seems potentially some sort of increasing political risk there. I guess you obviously have some time before full funds demission but I guess do those developments kind of give you any positive. Can you also just remind us - stability agreements when it comes to taxes and royalties or other rights?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tyler, good morning. We've been operating in Peru for 30 years. We're basically in Peru, before democracy was in place, is how we've linked and worked through what has been a color democracy in Peru's modern history. And this is another chapter in that journey. So we'll monitor the Presidential Elections carefully and have the Congress and hopefully the new President work together. We have been a very successful 30 years in Peru. When we think about making investments like Yanacocha Sulfides. We think about making investments which for project like Sulfides if you literally for big ice with the quality of the Sulfide deposit around the Yanacocha property, so little bit we're looking to understand these are coming in the next month or two. That will factor into our process of internal discussions with our board and our joint venture partner and then ultimately, I look forward to being able to make a full fast decision and the rest Sulfides and they have that delivering great returns for Newmont shareholders and the community around car [ph] market for a long, long time to go.
Tyler Langton: Okay, that's helpful and then just switching to Peñasquito, sort of production kind of did quite well in the quarter and both use of cash cost and all-in sustaining cost decent amount below guide, can you just kind of remind us your explanations for that mine for the year and what to kind of expect in the following quarters?
Tom Palmer: I'll get Rob to provide some color on it. It's pretty steady performance and we certainly look at, it's a polymetallic mine, so we certainly look at developing that mine and managing on the basis of the form at it's sort of producing. But if you see, pretty steady performance through the year. Rob, if you want to provide a bit more color to Tyler.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tyler. I'd really just back up what Tom said is that, the best way to describe Peñasquito is steady performance, where we get good gold one quarter. Where we go into other elements, another quarter. The key thing about Peñasquito is that the mill is performing well. The mine is performing well. The team is performing well and managing COVID as well as possible in a country which has suffered huge impact due to the pandemic. But it really is going to be a very steady. But a successful year, in Peñasquito.
Tyler Langton: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC. Please go ahead.
Josh Wolfson: So for the 2021 outlook the comment I guess is that, there's the assumption of no major COVID interruptions. The commentary on the call earlier was such that there's obviously a higher degree of interruptions in South America and then at brief stop I guess at Musselwhite. How would sort of those interruptions compared to some of the caveats with the new guidance?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Josh. Good morning. I think we're certainly seeing a number of impacts at both the Yanacocha and Cerro Negro. It's a real arching scene across our portfolio at countries where we're seeing greatest impact from COVID. We get better and better at managing our product goals both mentioned at Cerro Negro and not a dedicated theme managing shift changes which is a very, very complex process in Argentina and how you're doing all your grading and monitoring and ensuring and everything up with workforce in for the shift that - clear of the virus and quarantine, if we do ever close. So it's really monitoring those two operations. Mexico as a country is still struggling with the virus. But we've got very, very good protocols in place throughout that country. Well in the United States fortunately it's starting to really turn the tide. You've seen the recent events in Ontario, confident that the Canadian government will increase those through Australia and Ghana we've seen the pandemic managed through very well. I think we're still going to need to be have a chronic analyze and the continuing demand time and discipline around our protocols as vaccines become available encouraging our workforce to take the vaccines, supporting the governments where they came all that outside of it. We can have an improving trend overtime. So I believe they got the protocols and the discipline in place to manage COVID and maintain everyone through the course of this year.
Josh Wolfson: Great, thank you and then just maybe a question on some of the trends we're seeing. We've seen commentary at least from maybe not as much the gold sector but other resource companies about labor tightness and sort of regions and obviously with higher commodity prices globally. Is there any commentary you can provide on what trends you're seeing across the portfolio on labor and cost?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Josh. Monitoring that closely, labor cost back up about 6% of their cost base that include contracted services. We employed an assumption for later exploration in our budgets and then we flow that through to our guidance. So we've got some provision for that. The key leading indicator I look for in seeing what we maybe seeing some wage pressure is voluntary attrition. It's pretty healthy across our business. In some ways our response to the pandemic and the fact that we chose and we continue to choose to manage the health and safety of our workforce and local communities about everything else is, that served us really in terms of support that we have from our workforce. But the areas that I've been monitoring more closely on the risk of labor escalation - Australia, it's pretty high in all markets as you see, buying oil prices, heat in and all-time high. I wish Australian government that is locking borders and encouraging the workforce to come from within that state which put pressure on the supply of labor. We're very fortunate, we've got very robust workplaces at both Boddington and Tanami. Good leadership. Healthy levels of attrition and projects like tonnage haulage just mitigate that very significantly where your truck fleet and a labor force, truck fleet is one of the greatest sources of labors. So monitoring closely. But the voluntary efficient numbers are leading indicators took results across our business.
Josh Wolfson: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Tom, I guess this is a higher-level question. But when I look at your portfolio maybe on projects since you called in earlier on. It's pretty striking how much copper is there and you said, you could see yourself get into 20% copper exposure overtime. Is that a conscious decision? Over the longer term to diversify the production base or not? Or is that function of the projects that are available to you - look attractive to you think you're adding for like Tatogga?
Tom Palmer: Yes, thanks Greg. It's still very much clear focus on gold as the core of our business. But organically the way I've seen, that as you look for the best gold projects they come with particularly when you look at our world class initiative and look for those long-life projects and you look for those projects in the jurisdictions, we're prepared to work in. they come with copper. So it's more of an organic benefit from that. We focus on the right size projects in the right jurisdiction. The Tatogga project has some nice copper. The Yanacocha has some copper with it. And several of those mega projects particularly Galore Creek bring with them some nice copper. So it's more of an added benefit as we say it's going to come out of nice time with a world [indiscernible] their energy transition.
Greg Barnes: And just Tatogga, when I look at the acquisition price and if I assume you assumed $1,200 long-term goal that would have implied a pretty healthy long-term copper price. How did you approach the acquisition price to GT?
Tom Palmer: I've got Eric sitting opposite me. He's shepherd that one through, so why don't I get Eric to just give you a little bit color on that Greg.
Eric Colby: Greg, we obviously will look at multiple price scenarios. Since $1,200 would have been one of our base copper price at the time. I think it was 275 obviously that copper price and the outlook is quite strong. So we didn't have any single case that we looked at is, as you pointed out there's a fair bit of copper, there's a fair bit of gold. So it's really the interplay of the two metals across different scenarios. As we've - I think highlighted, we see potential for Tatogga to be a world class asset for us and that means a long life, pretty significant production, at good cost. Tom pointed out on the call, the geometry is pretty attractive to an efficient block cave and so all of that was attractive to us when making the acquisition.
Greg Barnes: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Congratulations on those trucks at Boddington. I love the color. Hope to see them one day. Just wanted to have a few questions if I could. Wanted to follow-up on Josh's question on inflation. You talked about the workforce, Tom in terms of watching movement there. Can you talk a little bit about if you're seeing any inflation in your capital `or cost some steel and or other materials, please? Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya. Good morning. So materials and energy, labor makes up 50%, materials and energy makes 30% to 40%. And again we leverage our global portfolio enter into long-term contracts and strategic relationships with suppliers, so that goes a long way to mitigating the impacts of near-term inflation where we've got rise and fall both into that contracts and stability. So it's a very important part of the Newmont story and the strength of our portfolio and how we look to run our business. We are seeing some pressure on steel generally around writing media that's watching carefully and some pressure on frac particularly with as you see the amount of concentrate that we move out of at Peñasquito. So we're watching those carefully. In terms of capital projects, we've already accounted for a lot of that in terms of the Tanami Expansion and the move to Australian steel so that's been taken up in previous updates to guide us. As move into Ahafo North, a lot of the work for the once we get the full funds approval for the next 12 to 18 months of efforts and the civil works before we start to bringing in steel. We're confident what the estimates that we've got, what we've look forward is for full funds. It's got to account for any escalation around steel and similarly as we start to button up Yanacocha Sulfides, both around [indiscernible] reviews and bring that forward full funds. We're including in our estimates and contingencies, estimates for way still make moves. So we do anticipate there'll be some pressure on steel for the capital projects and making sure we're calculating in the budgets that we look forward for full funds approval.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay and nothing on cyanide at all. You're not seeing any inflation pressures there?
Tom Palmer: No, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, great. Thanks for that and I guess just a continuation on the themes I keep asking, maybe just an update on any changes or royalties, taxation and any jurisdictions that you operate in, that you're hearing of in including the US?
Tom Palmer: No, it's all - I mean again it's pretty picture of our strategies where we choose to have our operations that brings with it, a lot of stability around our investment agreements whether in place or royalty budget. So we're not seeing any pressure on that front across that jurisdictions.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay and then just last question before I hand it over to someone else's. Just wanted to make sure that the guidance that you provided with your Q4 release which was production was going to be 47%, 48% expected in the first half and 52%, 53% in the second half still is intact?
Tom Palmer: It is, I'd say. I'd look more 47% in the first half and 53% in the second half and it's going to be dominated by Ahafo and Boddington reaching the greater buying and higher grades. As you move through the third quarter into the fourth and the second half. So I'd sort of factor in 47%, 53%.
Tanya Jakusconek: And if I could squeeze just one more in, within treat about vaccinations 70% at Éléonore. Just maybe if you could share, any other mines that you have, where you have your vaccination for COVID is actually very well? I didn't hear anything about Africa, just wondered if you could share just a bit more color on that.
Tom Palmer: Sure, Tanya. We're certainly encouraging the rollout in Ontario and I'm sure you're living 10 experience right now, so doing what we can to support the rollout for our Musselwhite port operations. Cripple Creek and Victor certainly see the rollout Colorado, we've been setting up clinics for our workforce and their families and continue to do that and provide access to vaccines and lots of education encouragement around the efficacy of these vaccines. Through Peru, Argentina and Mexico, Suriname, a much longer road to home. So we must maintain those protocols. Vaccines will come and we'll support. But we work on the expectations that's still many months of. Australia to get the vaccine together and get the vaccines rolled out. We look forward to that increasing overtime. So that one we can top those, you just stay forward for - that are impacting on mining operations and then open up international borders rollout allowing to come and go up again. And in Ghana, I think we're starting to see some rollout of vaccines. So I'm pleased already [indiscernible] in Ghana. We've been looking to work with the Ghanaian Government for the rollout. It's going to be a long process. Tanya, I think before the world is fully vaccinated. So I think we're going to be living with [indiscernible] mask for a long time to come in operations.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Mike Jalonen: Tom, - workout Éléonore to get vaccinated and here in Canada. But just following along going's question with your three big copper, gold projects. I'm seeing a number of juniors with gold, big gold, copper projects, and got mark caps of billion plus. Just wondering how does Newmont service value in these projects? I don't know much of what the union [indiscernible] Galore Creek or much in your share price, stop me if I'm wrong. Just wondering what steps you could take? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Mike and good morning. We're working in same way that we hit an exploration webcast early this year and we'll certainly look to do an ESG webcast on the back of our new sustainability report in the coming months. We're working on providing some more details and maybe doing so through another webcast. We can have a little bit more time to provide some detail and cover our most projects as well as some of the other projects that are sitting or going project pipeline. So we can link the level of understanding and the appreciation that we have all those projects and how we can sequence the need and why we're so confident about our business over the next several decades. I hope someday we turn 100. And we've got through our gain project pipeline and ability to see early around next century. So we're excited about it and I think there's an opportunity for us to provide the investment community with some more details in that.
Mike Jalonen: Okay, thanks and Happy Birthday.
Tom Palmer: I'll blow out a candle for you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: So first I want to commend you guys on your initiative to reduce risk around the teams I know that is actually a real risk. So what made me leave engineering about 18 years ago and sadly after I left someone died [indiscernible] because of work back-to-back shift. I commend you on that. But related to that question, could you give us an idea of - if there's any kind of cost that we should expect associated with those kinds of initiatives?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Anita and good morning. I mean we're seeing an incorporated our guidance around sustaining capital and some Tanami Expansion 2 it's in the development capital. But as part of those plans to build additional camp facilities. Yanacocha so far will have included in a [indiscernible] effective probably similarly lead time items additional camp facilities so they'll be able to have, they have their own room and their own bed. So it's accommodated within millions dollars of year of sustaining capital and $600 million to $800 million in average development capital. It's not big money in overall scheme of things. It's about having the intent and the will to do something in this space. In terms of productivity improvements around staff, finish time and ensuring their fatigue breaks. The length of shifts, number of consecutives shift, the length of time some can work. In my experience you have that tie back in dividends many times over, by getting the right level of rest amongst your workforce so they're working productively when they're at work. So the things we're doing around roster start times and alike. Will improve their productivity overtime is my expectation rather than the cost of the business.
Anita Soni: Second question a little bit more in the detail on Cerro Negro. The grades went down a little bit. I'm just wondering, how we can expect that to play out over the course of the year and what was the reason. I mean are you using stockpiles right now and then you'll return once you can get, I guess the mining rates up from direct access, is my guess. I just don't know - I don't have a color on that.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita. I'll get Rob to take that question.
Rob Atkinson: Hi, Anita. Fairly straight forward that's because of COVID because of the absences, the production from our higher-grade stopes at Merian's north and Eureka were bore and limited because of the lack of development. So it's purely a sequencing due to lack of employees. But those are the areas that we're most focused and the workforce is back working and we're nearly through rates. So hopefully in coming months, we'll see that turn around. But it was just a timing issue due to lack of employees.
Anita Soni: Okay and then lastly, more of a big picture question perhaps on for Nancy. Just looking at your dividend payout ratio in that where you know just currently sitting slightly below. But you do have a good on gold price. But you do have a good cash balance. Can you give us an idea if we're thinking about downside risk on gold price? How do you like sort of play with the cash balance that you have? I noticed that it's prior to the gold prices it was sort of sitting around $3 billion as the cash balance you wanted. Would you think about you mentioned of reducing that cash balance as needed? If gold price dips, first sustained period.
Nancy Buese: Thanks for the question, Anita. Yes, we said in prior times that at a $1,200 gold price, we would like to keep around $2.3 billion to $3 billion cash balance. We're certainly carrying significantly more than that today. But I do think that's a testament to couple things, one is our ability to be very nimble with the dividend and we provided a very clear framework and a lot of transparency about the optionality between that 40% and 60%. So there's some great points about that and then the other piece. As we're still in a time of very much uncertainty around COVID and we also have a lot of development capital. So I think carrying considerably higher balances and not at today's gold price is a great strategy for us. But certainly a lot of optionality and flexibility around those balances, which is what we've consistently stated.
Tom Palmer: And Anita, I need to build on that. We look with our board back over a long period of time at gold prices and the cash would actually generate it. And that factored into a decision to stay up and calibrated I think $100 mark and on return 40% of that cash. So at the stability and sustainability of our dividend is very robust. So we didn't make that decision to go to the $1,800 mark lightly and our expectation would be, when we look forward in portfolio and our performance that we can sustain those levels for some time.
Anita Soni: And just lastly, I know it does and your disclosure already include your free cash flow projections include Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides and just wanted to confirm that any lumpiness in those spends. But also being included within that $1,800 40% to 60% and those projects.
Tom Palmer: Absolutely.
Anita Soni: Thanks.
Tom Palmer: [Indiscernible].
Anita Soni: Okay, thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Anita and I think that's the end of the questions and we can certainly queue on conscious. We've gone half top of the hour. So thank you all for your time. And our number if you are on Toronto [indiscernible] at the moment and [indiscernible] on state. Stay safe and well and we look forward to seeing and speaking to you soon. Thanks everyone.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-18 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Colby, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.
Eric Colby: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Randy Engel, Executive Vice President of Strategic Development. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found at our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom on slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges. But through it all, we remain focused on continuing to differentiate ourselves as the clear industry leader. And I'm proud to say that we have delivered record-breaking results as a consequence. Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. The safety and well-being of our employees and local communities remains a fundamental principle of our company. Unfortunately, the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and we remain disciplined in the application of the key health and safety protocols across our business. Despite the challenges of managing through an unprecedented pandemic, we achieved the best safety performance in our company's history. This was a result of having a clear focus on managing the fatality risks across our company, and ensuring that we have a consistent and rigorous approach to the application of critical controls required to manage these risks. We continue to lead the industry with our ESG practices, setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2030 and achieve net zero carbon by 2050. We met full year guidance delivering more than 5.9 million ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining costs of $1,045 per ounce. In addition to this, we produced a further 1 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc at all-in sustaining costs of $858 per gold equivalent ounce.  Last year, our 12 managed operations supported by an integrated operating model and a culture of continuous improvement, delivered $790 million in cost and productivity improvements through our Full Potential program. We continue to maintain our discipline of improving margins at $1,200 per ounce, allowing us to capitalize on our significant leverage to higher gold prices and delivering record financial results. In 2020, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, the highest in the industry and ended the year with $5.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The strength and stability of our business supports our industry-leading dividend framework. This framework provides our shareholders with the stability of a base annualized dividend of $1 per share calibrated at a $1,200 gold price assumption and the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above $1,200. Newmont continues to set the standard as the clear industry leader in shareholder returns, which we further differentiated with a 38% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced yesterday, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share and our annualized dividend rate to $2.20 per share. With this increase, our current dividend yield places us in the top 25 dividend payers of a large-cap S&P 500. We also recently announced a new $1 billion share buyback program. This follows the $1 billion program we completed in the fourth quarter, which reduced our total share count by 22 million at an average price of $45 per share. Our industry-leading dividend and share repurchase program are a reflection of our commitment to deliver industry-leading shareholders returns, whilst remaining focused on the financial strength and flexibility needed to create value throughout the price cycle. Shifting now to safety. I'd like to expand a bit more on our 2020 safety performance on slide five. 12 months ago I outlined a key change that we were making at Newmont around our safety measures, stepping away from the mining industry's traditional use of lagging personal injury rates in our bonus programs, to measures that are focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. At the time, I also challenged management teams and boards in our industry to follow our lead and shift the focus away from personal injury rates to measures that will lead to the creation of fatality, injury, and illness-free environment. So how did we go? During 2020, we completed over 70,000 interactions by leaders in the field that were focused on ensuring that the critical controls required to prevent a fatality are understood and being effectively managed by our team members exposed to these risks. As a consequence, I'm proud to report we reduced our significant potential events by 63% and achieved the lowest personal injury rates in our company's history, with a total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked. It is no coincidence that visible thought leadership focused on fatality prevention is driving a significant improvement in all of our safety metrics. Turning now to our portfolio on slide six. Among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, we have nine world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year at all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce and with a mine life that exceeds 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top key jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. We firmly believe that we have the right-sized portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class responsibly-managed assets located in the best gold mining jurisdictions. As we described in some detail on our exploration webcast last week, our portfolio is enhanced by the gold industry's best exploration pipeline of greenfield and brownfield opportunities. This exploration portfolio is managed through our proven integrated operating model, which ensures our exploration teams work hand in hand with our projects and operations teams. One of the key benefits of this integration is that we do not reinvent the wheel and duplicate effort. With the majority of our exploration activities occurring near existing operations, we have familiarity, not only with geology and terrain, but also the permitting, regulatory and community relationships surrounding each of our operations. Turning now to the reserve and resources underpinning our asset base on slide seven. All reserves are the lifeblood of a mining company and replacing our reserves is critical to sustaining production. As we reported last week, we ended the year with 94 million ounces of gold reserves. Our team's ability to convert reserves and replace 80% of depletion in such a challenging year was truly remarkable. In addition to our reserves, we also offer substantial future upside through our resource base of over 101 million ounces of gold. And we are in the very fortunate position of also having significant exposure to other metals, including copper, silver, lead and zinc. These other metals are contributing substantial value to our portfolio today, generating solid cash flows each and every quarter from Peñasquito and Boddington. Turning now to our stable long-term production profile on slide eight. Underpinned by our leading reserve base and exploration program, our portfolio will produce steady gold production of more than 6 million ounces through into at least 2030, balanced across each of our four regions. This profile is further enhanced by the production of more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver lead and zinc at Peñasquito and copper, at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year, for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. Then moving to, slide 9 for a look at our five-year guidance. As we shared in December, our five-year outlook shows that we will steadily increase attributable, gold production to nearly 7 million ounces over the next five years. And our all-in sustaining costs will improve in 2021 to $970 per ounce. And further improve to between, $800 to $900 per ounce by 2024, as we get the benefit from our investments in Autonomous Haulage at Boddington, improved underground mining methods at Ahafo, the expansion at Tanami, the development of Yanacocha Sulfides and a new mine at Ahafo North. As well as continuing to deliver sustainable value from Full Potential improvements across our portfolio of 12 managed operations. Turning now to our free cash flow generation potential on slide 10, our balanced portfolio combined with our disciplined and integrated operating model, provides significant leverage to high gold prices, from the largest production and reserve base, in the world. For every $100 increase in gold price above our base assumption, Newmont delivers $400 million of incremental, attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1200 gold price assumption, our base free cash flow is still totaled $3.5 billion, over the next five years. And at current gold prices, our portfolio would generate more than $15 billion of free cash flow, over that same time frame. To be clear, this is free cash flow that is entirely attributable, to Newmont's account, enabling us to provide industry-leading returns. With that, I'll hand it over to Rob, to discuss our operational performance, on slide 11.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tom. Before jumping into the regions, I'd like to start by saying, how very proud I am of our entire team. And what they have safely accomplished, while navigating, such a tough and unprecedented year in 2020. Heading into 2021, we remain very diligent in our application of our wide ranging controls and safety protocols to place the health, safety and well-being of our teams and our communities above all else. Turning to slide 12, I'll give an update on Australia's performance. In 2020, Australia produced approximately 1.2 million ounces of gold, at all-in sustaining costs of $964 per ounce. At Boddington, we've produced approximately 670,000 gold ounces and 56 million pounds of copper, in 2020. The site delivered a single year record for mill performance reaching 40.5 million tonnes processed, against a nameplate capacity of 35 million tonnes per annum. Achieving this level of performance is a testament to the successful implementation and consistent delivery of our proven Full Potential program, which is a direct result of the continuous improvement mindset of our dedicated site leadership personnel. We have completed three, Full Potential refreshes at Boddington since 2013. And continue to identify opportunities to take performance to the next level. During the fourth quarter higher throughput and consistent grades, drove strong production. Sustaining capital was higher than normal, as we took early receipt of Cat trucks, as part of the Autonomous Haulage system which drove higher all-in sustaining costs. We're well on our way to operating the world's first open pit gold mine, with an autonomous truck fleet, improving the safety of our employees and extending life at one of Newmont's cornerstone assets. 10 of the 29 new Cat trucks have already arrived on site, with four of those trucks fully commissioned and being put through their paces on the test circuit. We'll soon begin full deployment of these impressive autonomous vehicles that will increase productivity and improve mining rates. These improved mining rates coupled with higher grade, expected later in the year from the South Pit positions Boddington to deliver a stronger second half and over one million equivalent gold ounces for 2021. I'd also like to highlight something we talked about last week at our exploration webcast. The area between the North and South Pits in the picture has had limited drilling to date. But from the knowledge that we do have, we do believe there is a potential to combine the pits into one larger super pit to further extend the mine life. At Tanami, we produced nearly 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $745 per ounce, one of our best-performing assets in the entire Newmont portfolio. Tanami continues to deliver productivity improvements, setting new records for underground development and mining rates for the year. The team continues to progress our second Tanami expansion, which I will now discuss on slide 13. We remain very excited about the second expansion project at Tanami and the site's future as a long-life and low-cost producer. Through the development of a 1.6 kilometer deep production shaft and supporting infrastructure, the project will improve production by around 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year while reducing operating costs by approximately 10%. In addition, Tanami Expansion 2 will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the district, which has the potential to grow annual production to more than 700,000 ounces per year. As we mentioned during our exploration update, we have added significant reserves and resources at Tanami and we are especially excited about the potential to advance near-mine exploration at Oberon. The Tanami expansion project is approximately 25% complete and we've invested around $130 million so far. We have achieved a significant milestone, finalizing the major construction contracts required to complete the project. However, the pandemic has had an impact on construction contractors in Australia, which has resulted in higher-than-anticipated contracting rates. In addition, we encountered unanticipated geological structures during the completion of the pilot hole and the raise bore drilling process. As a result due to vertical deviation from our plan, we've had to increase the shaft diameter from 5.7 meters to 6.3 meters. The vertical deviation was only 300 millimeters less than one foot over the length of a shaft that is nearly one mile deep. This is less than 0.2%, but it's very important to ensure a controlled development and a final shaft that will operate in a safe and optimal manner for decades to come. Taking into account, the impact of COVID, higher contracting costs and work resulting from the increased shaft diameter, we have revised our projected total capital cost to between $850 million and $950 million. The project is expected to reach commercial production in the first half of 2024 and we continue to work closely with our EPCM Worley to safely deliver this important project. It is important to note that this increase does not impact our long-term outlook announced in December. I'm proud of the team at Tanami and the persistence they've shown in executing such a complex project during a challenging year. Turning to Africa on slide 14. Our assets in Africa had another year of solid performance in 2020, producing over 850,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $890 per ounce. Akyem delivered a solid quarter supported by higher grades and improved mill throughput by partnering with the process control team and our operations support hub in Perth. This is how Newmont is leveraging its operating model to consistently drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects. As we progress through 2021, the site is well-positioned to deliver higher production and improved costs as it benefits from higher grades ahead of a new layback. Ahafo continued its steady performance in the fourth quarter as Subika Underground delivered higher tonnes mined and grade. We continue to progress the development of our changed mining method at Subika sublevel shrinkage, which will have safely increased tonnage, reduce mining costs and capture higher efficiencies. We expect to continue the ramp-up to full-scale production of the sublevel shrinkage method by bringing on first full stoping area in quarter two this year and we expect to complete the full-scale ramp-up by mid-2022. In 2021, we expect to see higher grades at Subika and Awonsu open pits, towards the second half of this year, which will drive higher second half production at the Ahafo site. Finally, at Ahafo North, the best unmined deposit in West Africa, we are finalizing the permitting process and we remain firmly on track for a full funds decision in the coming months. Turning to South America, on slide 15. South America, the region most impacted by the virus had a strong finish to 2020, producing nearly 1.1 million attributable gold ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,100 per ounce. At Merian, we exceeded our outlook with nearly 350,000 attributable ounces for the year, and we surpassed two million ounces of gold produced since starting operations in October 2016. During the fourth quarter, the site delivered very solid performance based on higher throughput and recovery and utilizing an ore blending strategy that resulted in a single-day record for mill performance of 54,000 tonnes processed. In 2021, Merian transitions from softer saprolite to harder ore, which supports higher production through improved recoveries and grades, but is partially offset by lower mill throughput. At Cerro Negro, we continue to manage government restrictions related to COVID. Our disciplined safety protocols have allowed for more than 20 shift changes since the pandemic began and we've performed over 14,000 tests through the company's owned and operated on-site PCR testing lab. While challenges remain with reduced levels of personnel during the quarter, production rates returned to pre-COVID levels and focus remains on improving these rates through a number of Full Potential initiatives. In 2021, our focus is on increasing development rates and the development at the Merian's complex, which we expect will increase ore tonnes mined and sustain consistent levels of production. At Yanacocha, we managed through significant COVID challenges in 2020, delivering a steady end-of-year performance. Our focus on higher grades for leaching, helped to offset the impact of lower tonnes mined and higher-than-usual rainfall during the fourth quarter. We have also begun our transition to leach-only operations with a ramp-down of the oxide mill ahead of the development of Yanacocha Sulfides and expect production for 2021 to be weighted to the second half of the year, as we reach higher grades. Study work on the Sulfides project is progressing well is nearing completion and we expect to apply for full funds approval to move the project into execution, during the second half of 2021. Turning to North America, on slide 16. North America delivered solid fourth quarter results, ending the year with approximately 1.5 million ounces of gold production and nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces. At Peñasquito, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter, after overcoming a challenging year. The site topped new records for mill throughput since the acquisition, averaging throughput of approximately 105,000 tonnes per day. And we saw record performance from the Pyrite Leach plant for gold and concentrate production. At Musselwhite, we completed two important projects that are critical to ensuring the site's future, the new conveyor and the materials handling system. Musselwhite ramped up mining in the fourth quarter and reached its highest ore tonnes mined for a single quarter since the acquisition. With underground development progressing ahead of plan and the utilization of the new conveyor and materials handling system, Musselwhite is positioned to produce 200,000 ounces in 2021 with a stronger second half, as ore tonnes mined continue to improve. Éléonore delivered its strongest quarter of the year for both production and costs. 2020 was a transformational year for Éléonore, as our site leadership team focused on resetting the operation and improving efficiency and productivity, resulting in higher margins. Completing the lower mine materials handling system, earlier in October, has also enabled the team at Éléonore to achieve higher underground development rates from deeper in the mine. Porcupine delivered solid results for the year with nearly 320,000 ounces of gold production, meeting our full year guidance. Fourth quarter results remain steady on increased underground development rates at Borden and a higher grade mined at Kalgoorlie. In 2021, Porcupine will produce 360,000 ounces of gold production with higher grades and improved mining rates being achieved in the second half of 2021. And at CC&V, we remain focused on safely delivering on our plan with over 250,000 ounces of production in 2021 with higher mill grades being achieved also in the second half of the year. And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on slide 17.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Turning to slide 18 for the financial highlights. As you can see on this slide, we had an exceptional year and delivered our best quarterly performance of 2020 in the fourth quarter, including $3.4 billion in revenue an increase of over $400 million from the prior year quarter driven by higher prices; adjusted net income of $856 million or $1.06 per diluted share; adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.8 billion, an increase of 37% from the prior year quarter; and nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter and an amount entirely attributable to Newmont's account. This strong financial performance allows us to raise our dividend for a third time since the beginning of 2020, with the fourth quarter dividend declared of $0.55 per share which is almost four times larger than the fourth quarter dividend from 2019. Turning to slide 19, for a review of our adjusted earnings per share in more detail. Fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $806 million or $1 per share. Adjustments included $0.18, primarily related to the sale of royalty interest and changes in the fair value of our investments; $0.03 related to incremental COVID-specific costs such as additional screening protocols transportation costs and community fund disbursements; $0.20 related to reclamation and remediation adjustments primarily at Yanacocha; $0.06 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance; and $0.07 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $1.06 per diluted share, an increase of $0.56 over the prior year quarter. Turning now to slide 20. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities, which include maintaining our financial strength and flexibility, reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects, and returning cash to shareholders. During the year, Newmont reinforced its position as the clear industry leader for shareholder returns and financial performance. We maintain over $8.5 billion in liquidity with $5.5 billion of available cash. $550 million of that cash will be used to repay our 2021 senior notes that are due in June of this year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now at 0.2 times. And in the fourth quarter, we were placed on positive outlook by Standard & Poor's and we were upgraded by Moody's to Baa1 credit rating further demonstrating our balance sheet strength. We returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in 2019 and 2020. Newmont has a unique ability to lead in shareholder returns maintain strength and financial flexibility and develop profitable projects, such as the expansion of Tanami, Ahafo North, and Yanacocha Sulfides. Looking ahead in 2021, we will continue executing on our proven track record of superior shareholder returns with a new $1 billion share repurchase program and an industry-leading dividend framework. Turning to slide 21 for more details about the dividend. In October, Newmont established a dividend framework that provides shareholders with a stable base annualized dividend of $1 per share at a $1,200 gold price, along with the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above our base plan. The fourth quarter dividend declared yesterday was calibrated at an $1,800 gold price assumption and a 40% distribution of incremental free cash flow, resulting in a 38% increase over the prior quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, at the current share price, our current dividend translates to a yield over 3.5% and places us in the top 25 dividend payers of the large-cap S&P 500. The increase to our quarterly dividend reflects the strength and stability of our business, a recognition of the current gold price environment and our ability to maintain capital discipline. We will continue to assess our dividend on a quarterly basis and are confident that our framework will provide shareholders with an attractive dividend yield and participation in our cash flow generation at these higher gold prices. With that I'll hand it back to Tom on slide 22. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to pause and acknowledge Randy Engel, who has made the decision to retire in the second quarter after dedicating 27 years of service to our company. For the past 15 years, Randy has led our Strategy and Corporate Development groups serving on the senior and executive leadership teams of three CEOs. Over his career, Randy and his team have completed more than $35 billion in transactions, including the purchase of Cripple Creek & Victor, the sale of Batu Hijau and most importantly the acquisition of Goldcorp and the establishment of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture in 2019. I am enormously grateful to Randy for the contributions he has made to our company over his distinguished career and for the friendship and support that he has provided to me during my time at Newmont. I wish him all the very best in his well-earned retirement and with whatever he chooses to embark on in the next chapter of his life which will no doubt include lots of time in the outdoors with his family and friends. With Randy's retirement Blake Rhodes, currently our Senior Vice President of Strategic Development will assume responsibility for Strategy and Corporate Development reporting directly to me. Blake has been with Newmont for 25 years serving in a variety of positions, including General Counsel and Senior Vice President for our Indonesian business. Blake has played a central role in all of the major transactions we have completed since 2014 and is well-prepared to succeed Randy. As I've discussed many times at Newmont we believe consistent operational environmental and social performance starts with good governance, which includes thoughtful succession planning. This transition is another example of our commitment to sound governance practices and reflects our deep bench strength of capable leaders. As we near our 100th birthday, I am more confident than ever that we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow and do so for decades to come. Our clear strategy lays the groundwork to clearly differentiate Newmont as the world's leading gold company as we work to continue to demonstrate our commitment to our purpose of creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. 
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I might have missed this, but can you comment on Cerro Negro and the government restrictions that were imposed, I think in December and how that impacts production going forward? I know in the commentary, you mentioned that the mine is ramping up again. But any color on kind of what the -- how long the impact could be or what you're seeing from a mining mill perspective would be helpful. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks and good morning, Fahad. I'll pass that question across to Rob. The specific restrictions were associated with a shutdown around the Christmas New Year period for the whole of the mining industry in Argentina. And then, those restrictions or controls for people moving around the country were lifted after that, but few day period back to what was in place prior to Christmas. And we're operating to those protocols. Rob, do you have any other details or color you wanted to add to that?
Rob Atkinson: No, Tom. You covered it. The most significant one was that all country one that was imposed between Christmas and the New Year, but we're now operating under the same restrictions as before. So, nothing else to add.
Fahad Tariq: And from a percentage perspective, are you basically saying it's back to 100% of normal capacity, or is it still below capacity?
Rob Atkinson: I'll just follow-on to that Fahad. Yes. Thanks, Tom. Fahad, we're probably running about 80% to 85%, and that's primarily because of COVID impacts that Argentina is still suffering from COVID. And we've got a few of our employees testing positive. And as a result, we do have a number of people unable to work. So that's really meaning that we're kind of averaging about the 85% capacity at the moment.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, great. That’s pretty clear. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad.
Operator: The next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thank very much. I just -- I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your dividend policy maybe just to get some clarification. The first question would be the framework that you've set up the 40% to 60% of your incremental cash flows. Can you tell me maybe what you would need to see to move from the 40% that you used for this dividend you reported the other day, up more closer to the 60% level? What would be the driver to change that part of the formula? And then, just as a follow-up question on the share buyback. Do you expect to complete most of that $1 billion this year? I know you have an 18-month window. Just wondering, if you could give us some sense on the timing of that, and if that's discretionary or if you have a program in place? Thanks so much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie. I'll kick-off, and Nancy, you might want to chime in as well. When we sit down with our Board, each quarter and look at our dividend through that framework Jackie, we look back on a significant period of time in this discussion we had this week with the Board was looking at the second half of 2020, where gold was averaging a bit above $1,800 through that 6-month period. So we talked through lifting from the $1,500 zone to the $1,800 zone because of that gold performance. We would continue to have those discussions every quarter. Certainly, as we talked about in our -- we introduced our framework in October, it's more likely to be a semiannual move with conversations taking place each quarter. But we'd be looking at what gold has been doing over at least that lagging six-month period and we'd look into the future, and we're looking at what the macroeconomics may be indicating in terms of gold as we think about that 40% to 60% range. But we certainly saw in the discussion that there was good gold price performance that had us lift from the $1,500 to the $1,800. And then, we still got upside in front of us if gold maintains its current levels or higher. So that we thought that was a prudent decision within the context of our framework. And we will have that conversation every quarter with our Board. In terms of the share repurchase program, it's up to $1 billion over 18 months. So the previous program is very much linked to our divestments of KCGM, Red Lake and Continental. We brought in $1.4 billion and we returned $1 billion from those divestments in 2019 to shareholders through that buyback through the course of last year. With this program over an 18-month period up to $1 billion we've been looking to opportunistically go into the market where we saw a disconnect between market value and our assessments of our intrinsic value of the business. So for us it's a dynamic we will be looking for that disconnect and then you should expect to see Newmont buying. I'd also say that the dividend framework in our capital allocation strategy takes primacy over the share buyback as we move forward. Nancy is there anything you'd add to that? 
Nancy Buese: Yes. Tom just a couple of quick things. Just to reiterate Jackie that the repurchase program doesn't impact our ability to continue to offer those higher dividends. So we are very flexible in that way. I think that's a key differentiator is our ability to offer both the dividend with full transparency and also the share buyback programs. And then really it is a discretionary program and we will consider a number of factors when we decide to repurchase, but the fundamental underlying thesis is that it will be an accretive purchase. So lots of things to think about but our view is to provide more value to shareholders in an accretive way. 
Jackie Przybylowski: Thank you, Nancy and Thomas.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Hi, Tom, Rob and Nancy. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I had just related to what's built into the guidance around COVID. Are you sort of taking what you're seeing today, or are you allowing for potential hiccups that could occur? Just trying to work out whether the guidance is sort of the midpoint of the outcomes or whether there's upside if things improve better around COVID? And then just related to that, just wondering if you could quantify maybe on a dollar per ounce basis what the cost of operating in a COVID environment is today and maybe on an ongoing basis? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks Chris. Again I'll kick off. And Nancy or Rob may want to chip in as well. We've included about a $10 an ounce impact for COVID in our guidance. And that's a lot to do with the hygiene rates and social distancing the additional logistics of moving people back and forth. And I'd anticipate as we see in the world play out that we're going to be managing COVID protocols for at least all of 2021 in some shape or form. We may see a little bit of movement around that number, but that's what we're expecting. Rob or Nancy do you want to provide any additional color or Nancy point to where there's some more detail in some of the particulars that we published? 
Rob Atkinson: Tom, just to add to what you said. I think Chris we have adapted very, very well to the situation. And one of the key things is that a number of the folks that we've taken off the sites we're working hard to make sure we stay that way. So we've made almost a permanent change. But I think the biggest change that we will see is as the vaccinations are rolled out, as the pandemic eases being able to go back to more normality of people in buses, people in cars et cetera. So you need less buses, less cars to transport similar people in similar flights etcetera. Those are the things which will make the big differences. But I think one of the key things I'd say is that we have adjusted very well to the situation and I think we'll continue to evolve in a positive way. Nancy? 
Nancy Buese: Thanks. And yes just to reiterate it is about $10 an ounce built into our guidance for 2021. And then just as a reminder the impacts of COVID for this year will be reported and disclosed in the other expense line item of our financial statements. Back to you Tom. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks Nancy. 
Chris Terry: The other question I had just on Peñasquito. Now that you've had -- been able to ramp the mine back up in the second half of last year after the COVID impact. I was wondering if you could talk through what you're seeing and whether there's opportunities in terms of recovery rates or mining. And I know that was one of your target assets in the Goldcorp acquisition. So I just wondered if you could give a more detailed update on that asset and where the potential lies?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks Chris. We're really pleased with how Peñasquito has not only ramped up out of care and maintenance but is performing and the upside opportunity. And Rob do you want to provide a little color to that for Chris?
Rob Atkinson: No, I certainly will. And just to reemphasize that what we've achieved at Peñasquito has been I think quite remarkable, and when you actually look at last year that is about 13 records that we broke. And the reason I just say that is that those are based around the augmented feed. And not only have we increased it on average, but we've still got some room to go. And if we compare what we did at Boddington at 40.5 million tonnes through the mill on a nameplate capacity of 36 million, we've still got a long ways to go at Peñasquito to really make sure that we're sustaining those. But we're working very, very positively. I think in the mine as well, the basics such as payload, and for example, we've been able to increase payload there by nearly 13 tonnes per truck, which may not seem a lot, but given the size of the fleet that's 25,000 tonnes a day that we're able to do. And when you couple that with the drill and blast improvements, the supply chain improvements, the Pyrite Leach performance where we also saw a record performance in the last four months of last year that, it's a site which is showing that it really can perform across a whole number of things. So in short, very pleased with it. I think the potential upside is still very significant just doing the basics and the full potential process that Newmont has used over many, many years as a fundamental part of that.
Chris Terry: Thanks, Rob. And that's it for me. And all the best Randy on your retirement. Thanks.
Randy Engel : Thanks very much, Chris. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning everybody. And thanks for taking my question. I'll start with the easy one, which is Randy congratulations on your retirement.
Randy Engel: Thanks Tanya. 
Tanya Jakusconek: You're welcome. Moving on to just second easier one which is just on the production profile for 2021. I just want to make sure I had all of the mines that were second half weighted. That was Ahafo, Yanacocha, Mussel, Porcupine, CC&V. Is that correct? Those are the only ones?
Tom Palmer: That sounds correct Tanya, and I'd say if you want to get into a macro level the rough trend is going to be maybe 47, 48, 52, 53 first half, second half. And it's going to be the bigger mines that would drive that. So it will be Boddington and Ahafo. The other ones will contribute. But in terms of the big mines that contribute to that you will see that -- you will see our North American region and our South American region will largely even through the year just a little bit to the second half. And then you'll see both Australia and Africa probably more like 45, 55 because of the big contributions in those big assets coming in the second half.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So Boddington is also second half?
Tom Palmer: Yes, Boddington's second half. You're really going to second half and into the latter part of the second half as you get that autonomous fleet up and running and getting to some really good grades in the second half of the year.
Tanya Jakusconek: And there's nothing with Peñasquito that we should be aware of because that one can be quite quarter -- grade dependent per quarter?
Tom Palmer: Rob, any comments you'd want to make on Peñasquito?
Rob Atkinson: No. At the moment Tanya, we're in pretty good shape there. So it's looking as though it's going to hold up to fairly even first half to second half.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Perfect. And now that I have you on Rob, I just wanted to circle back to Tanami and just wanted to talk about the capital increase. And just so that I understand it's about $150 million. I'm just trying to understand a part of it is to do with increase on contractor pricing. Some of it was change in scope. And I think some of it is also a bit deferred in start-up. Is that correct?
Rob Atkinson: I'll just continue on that Tanya. The other part is really COVID itself. And if I give an example that we had planned to do all of our engineering in South Africa. But because of the logistics the bandwidth et cetera we had to move that to Santiago in Chile. That coupled with just getting people in and out of Australia has proven to be quite difficult. And then as you may remember that we had to change manufacturing plants from China back into Australia. So there is that kind of 30% related to COVID as well. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So 30% COVID and then the other 70% is pretty much change of scope higher contract pricing and a bit on timing. Would that be fair? 
Rob Atkinson: The change of scope would include that – the larger diameter of shafts. So if you include that most definitely. And then certainly the competitive market that we're seeing in Australia especially for those shaft sinking contractors. So those are certainly the big ones.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, given what we're seeing here just wanted to make sure I ask about inflationary pressures. Are we starting to see inflationary pressures come through the capital and cost structure at all?
Tom Palmer: I think it's quite a unique circumstance in Australia, Tanya with the nature of sinking of mild deep shaft and relocation in a country that's got international borders closed. As we look into Ahafo North, which will be the next project where we're doing work a lot of the work in 2021 is ground clearing, road diversion and using local contractors with some of the plant coming through in 2022. And you'd expect to see some of the COVID restrictions lifting. So I'm not seeing the same level of cost escalation there as we're seeing in quite some unique circumstances for the scope of the work and the location for Tanami.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. No, that’s good. Thank you very much for that.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: The next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Good morning, everyone. So Tanya asked similar questions to what I was going to ask about grade and then also about Tanami, and then you answered into the reads around Ahafo North. But could you just remind me, what capital we're looking at Ahafo? What the old guidance was?
Tom Palmer: I think the old guidance – correct me Eric, if I get this wrong but it's $750 million off the top of my head for the Ahafo North.
Anita Soni: Okay. So we could see a little bit higher but not to the extent that Tanami was – Tanami increased? 
Tom Palmer: Yes. I'd say you're looking at a $700 million to $800 million range for Ahafo. We're not seeing the same challenges for that project and its scope as we're seeing at Tanami.
Anita Soni: Okay. So at least maybe just one more question which is the dividend to go back to that. So you said you would assess it every quarter, but probably be sort of like a reassessment on the gold price every six months or so. Given that we're slightly under on the $1800 that you're using right now but also that you have like 40% versus the sort of 40% to 60% framework that you had outlined, if we remain at 670 – like this $1775 level maybe even $1750 for the next three months, how do you think that dividend like would evolve? Like there is enough buffer room, right to maintain the $0.55? Like what's your expectation of what the dividend like the excess could be if your – should we expect $0.55 for the next three quarters, or could you see that being pared back next quarter or in quarter three?
Tom Palmer: The key thing with our dividend framework was to have stability and predictability with it Tanya [ph]. So we will certainly – we're not looking to have it go up and down on a quarterly basis. Certainly at the end of the day, that's a Board decision and we need to look at the circumstances at the time. But having those $300 increments looking at it every quarter but really starting to orient over the longer-term on a semiannual basis for lifting or lowering or keeping the dividend the same. So we're not looking for it to have to go up and down. So we would look back at an April meeting. We'd look back at the gold price over the last six to nine months and make judgments about where it's at and where we see the macroeconomics going forward. We'd look at the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to maintain certain dividend level. So it's very much looking to have stability and predictability for our shareholders based upon a long-term view of gold price, both retrospectively and having a view going forward, as well as our business performance. So I hope you get some clarity.
Anita Soni: Yeah. I mean the $1,500 -- sorry the $1,500 gave us a little bit more buffer room. So now that we're sort of -- with this little bit of wobble, I just wanted to understand a little bit more in finer detail exactly where you were, what your thoughts are, but it sounds like it's more close to $1,800 would be enough to maintain the $1,800?
Tom Palmer: Yeah. And we look not only at the gold price, but we look at the cash flow look at on the balance sheet as well as we make those judgments.
Anita Soni: Okay. So you could draw on cash reserves if needed. Okay. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: I'm conscious that you'll have another call coming up at the top of the hour. So maybe we take one more question and then allow you to get to your next call and we can follow up for those who we missed out on.
Operator: The next question comes from Danielle Chigumira of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Danielle Chigumira: Great. Thank you. One follow-up on Australian inflation. So is it accurate to say that the inflation that you're seeing there is really on the CapEx side, because of the specific work that you're doing, rather than on the OpEx side? And just a broader question around COVID -- sorry go ahead and I'll ask the other one later.
Tom Palmer: It's quite a unique capital escalation both in terms of the nature of the job and the quite unique contractors who can sink a shaft and line a shaft of this dip. And then when you've got international border restrictions, then you are further constrained in terms of who are the quality contractors you can access. So that particular scope of work that contractor market has hardened due to COVID. We're not seeing the cost escalations on our operating side. We have long-term contracts in place with strategic suppliers and our labor turnover, which is an important input cost is at very healthy levels. So we're not seeing operating cost escalations.
Danielle Chigumira: Great. Thank you. That's very clear. And just secondly on COVID. So way you operate in South America and Ghana, are you engaging with the governments on how you guys can help in terms of vaccine deployments, whether that's using your own facilities or funding vaccines directly for your employees and local communities? What kind of conversations are you having there?
Tom Palmer: Yeah. So we operate across eight countries around the world and they're all in different phases of rolling out vaccines. And we're engaging with governments in every one of those countries, particularly in places like Ghana and through those Latin American countries to see where we can help and support them in the -- in terms of not only the rollout of the vaccine, but helping the education around the importance of vaccination. So that engagement. It's a continuation of the engagement we have with all of those governments as we've managed our way through the pandemic and looks to protect the health of our host communities and ensure that we can operate safely. So it's a continuation of those relationships and discussions that we've strengthened through the last 12 months with this pandemic.
Danielle Chigumira: Okay. That's useful. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. My apologies, if we couldn't get to all of your questions today. I was conscious that you've got another call to get on. Please know that Eric saw who was in the queue and we'll be back in touch with you to make sure we follow up with you on your questions. And thank you for your time and I wish you all a good rest of the day. Thanks everyone. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at Newmont.com. And now, I’ll turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jess, and thank you for all for joining us this morning. Before I start, I will take this opportunity to thank Jess Largent who will be leaving Newmont at the end of the year after more than five years with us, which included three years as Head of our Investor License Group. For those of you who have not had the chance to meet him, I also like to introduce Eric Colby, our Vice President of Strategic Communications. Eric was appointed to lead a strategic communications function earlier this year. And he combines both Investor Relations and Communications. Eric has been with Newmont since 2007 including three years working at Yanacocha in Peru. And since 2013, Eric has led multiple transactions as part of our corporate development team, playing a key role in the divestiture of Batu Hijau, the acquisition of Goldcorp, and the formation of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture. I would like to thank Jess for her many contributions to Newmont. The support that she has provided me and my team and wish her the very best of luck as she marks on her next adventure. Turning back to results. I'm very excited to share with you our record for third quarter performance as we continue to deliver on our purpose to create value and improve lives through responsible and sustainable mining. Turning to our quarterly highlights on Slide 4. Newmont has the industry's most diverse, balanced portfolio of world-class assets that provide stable production with significant leverage to rising gold prices. We have continued to manage through the COVID pandemic from a position of strength. With a proven leadership team, operating model and highly attractive workforce, we're building on our track record of superior value creation. I'm incredibly proud of how our teams across the world have responded to this pandemic. And the sacrifice this people have made and continue to make to support Newmont and the community in which we live and work. They have set a standard for leadership in our industry. All of our projects are now operational and we delivered record financial results. We produced 1.5 million ounces of gold and 273,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc putting us well on track to achieve our full-year guidance this year. We generated significant operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, the most in any quarter in Newmont's 100-year history. We have continued to sign advanced project works at Tanami, Subika Underground, and Musselwhite. We also announced the sale of royalty portfolio to Maverix Metals which closed yesterday and exploration joint ventures with Agnico Eagle in Colombia and Kirkland Lake in Canada. Our solid operating performance further improved our financial strength and flexibility. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of consolidated cash and reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times. And yesterday, we further demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our business and continued commitment to leading shareholder returns with a 60% increase to our quarterly dividend, which is now $0.40 per share, or $1.60 per share annualized. This is the second increase to our dividend this year and reflects the strength of Newmont portfolio to pay a higher dividend, while continue to advance profitable projects and maintain financial strength and flexibility. Newmont will remain disciplined in everything we do, including the prudent now approach to capital allocation, given the uncertainty in the world today. However, we will have an opportunity to evaluate even further returns to shareholders as we continue to do excess cash. And last, but certainly not least, we're the first and only mining company to achieve gender parity amongst their non-evasive directives. Setting an example at the very top of our organization that is fundamental to sustain cultural change. Turning to Slide 5 for more detail on our commitment to improving lives. At Newmont, we have a fundamental belief that a commitment to leading environmental, social and governance practices are essential to delivering sustainable long-term value, with all of our stakeholders. This starts with our commitment to our people and the work we're doing to sustainably improve health and safety and create a more inclusive culture across our global business. We continue to perform well against our public sustainability targets to source from local supplies, high within the communities in our operations, respond to community complaints in a timely manner, reduce our work consumption, and complete planned reclamation activities. We're on track to meet a seven-year target to reduce our carbon emissions by 16.5% by the end of this year, and are also working to develop longer-term science based targets for emissions, which we plan to release next month. We're committed to fully implementing the global industry standard from talent management that will help us improve how we manage these type of facilities. We're the second most transparent company in the S&P 500 and placed 12th out of more than 200 companies on the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark. These achievements are the result of related hard work from generations of leaders, lessons learned and improvements made that form the very DNA of Newmont. Turning to Slide 6, as a mining industry, we must continue to improve our health and safety performance. At Newmont, we have a relentless focus on ensuring that everyone who works in our business can return safely home to their families. As leaders it is up to us to create a culture in which fatality risks are clearly understood and sustainably managed at all times. Through visible sales leadership and the systems we put in place to manage risk consistently across our global business, we're working to significantly improve our safety performance. In response to eliminating fatality and supporting an injury-free workplace, Newmont made a symbolic change this year. Staying away from an industry's conditional use of a lagging personal injury rights in our bonus programs to mission that is focused on managing the critical controls that must be in place at all times to prevent fatalities. This year, we have completed over 40,000 Critical Control focused conversations in the field, conversations that have proactively identified and eliminated potential risks that could lead to a fatality. And we've recently began using digital tools, introducing an app across the organization to facilitate these conversations and capture more robust data that can quickly analyze and shape across our business globally. On the back of this work, we have reduced our significant potential events by two-thirds compared to 2019 and achieved a six-fold improvement from when I joined Newmont in 2014 and started out on this journey. And despite the significant leadership distractions due to managing COVID this year, we're on track to achieve the lowest personnel injury rate in our company's history with a total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.28 for 200,000 hours worked. It is no coincidence that visible felt leadership focused on fatality prevention is driving a significant improvement in all of our safety metrics. Turning now to the Industry's Best Portfolio on Slide 7. Among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, we had 8 world-class assets, each of which delivered more than 500,000 Gold equivalent ounces per year, and all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per ounce, and the mine life that exceed 10 years. Importantly, all eight are located in top tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by Fitch, Moody's, S&P and Fitch. We firmly believe that we have the right-size portfolio to generate sustainable returns from our world-class responsibly managed assets located in best gold mining jurisdictions. Underpinning our asset base are the largest gold reserves in the world with nearly 96 million ounces. We also offer substantial future upside to our dollar resources pipe with nearly 75 million ounces of measured and indicated resources. In addition to this, we have 63 million gold equivalent ounces in our reserves, which includes 15 billion pounds of copper. Importantly, 90% of our reserves are in the Americas and Australia. The exploration [indiscernible] and will continue to be at core competency in Newmont. Our disciplined exploration program makes the groundwork for growing our reserves and resource base to sustain stable, steady production, and cash loans for decades to come. Turning to Slide 8, our portfolio will generate more than 6 million ounces of gold per year through 2029. This stable production profile is underpinned by our eight world-class assets, our industry-leading exploration program, and our latest three development projects: Tanami Expansion 2 which is in execution, and then Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides both of which are in the late stages of the definitive feasibility. As you can see here, our portfolio provides steady production over the next decade, balance across each of our four regions. This profile is further enhanced by more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc at Penasquito and copper at Boddington and Yanacocha. Combined, we will deliver more than 7 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. Turning to our unrivaled project pipeline on Slide 9. Our project pipeline is unmatched in the gold industry and is one of the best in the mining industry. There is significant value to unlock as we optimize and advance our longer-term projects unlike the pathway to steady production and cash flow well into the 2040. Now major projects include Ahafo North, which is the best on mine gold deposit in West Africa and for which we expect to reach full fund decision early in the New Year. And Yanacocha Sulfides, which is also integrating towards a full fund decision next year, and has the potential to extend Yanacocha's life well into the 2030s. Looking at the earlier stage projects, in our pipeline, you will see two new projects increase visibility. With Pamour and Porcupine which is formally the CC&V project and Oberon and Tanami. The Pamour project is actually existing Pamour Open Pit and is smaller in scope than the prior CC&V project, which requires a relocation of the existing processing facilities in order to access the Dome mine. Developing Pamour is expected to extend mine life by another decade, providing us more time to explore the [indiscernible] and Dome whole value to find the next profitable extension of the Porcupine mine. Pamour is a great example of Newmont's disciplined investment system, which focuses on value creation and tight investment decisions to maintain a current production profile instead of progressing Hoyle complex capital intensive project. At Oberon, we're very excited that Newmont exploration continue to identify Hoyle prospective deposits with the potential to further extend life and reduce costs at the world-class Tanami asset. Rob will cover some more details on Oberon shortly. At Coffee, we completed our exploration mapping exercise and the closing the camp I think what we just stated. We remain excited about the potential at Coffee to fully optimize the orebody and improve value. In addition to our highly perspective gold projects, we had significant organic exposure to gold and copper poultry including Norte Abierto, Nueva Unión and Galore Creek. In fact, if you assume that one of the three mega projects completed their production profile at the back end of this decade, Newmont's total production would be around 15% to 20% copper, providing us a natural exposure to a metal of growing importance for reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the ongoing transition to a new energy economy. It's also worth noting that since 2016, I have made the delivery of 10 projects on solid budget, achieving an average internal rate of return of over 30%. Going forward we will build on this track record by continuing to apply our disciplined and rigorous approach to project and ensuring Newmont is well-positioned to generate superior value throughout the project cycle. Turning to our free cash flow generation potential on Slide 10. Our balanced portfolio, combined with our disciplined and operating model provides significant leverage to high gold process from the largest production and reserve base in the world. For every $100 increase in gold prices above our base assumption Newmont delivers approximately $400 million of incremental, attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price assumption, our base free cash flow would still total more than $5 billion over the next five years. At the current gold prices, our portfolio will generate more than $19 billion of free cash flow over that same timeframe. To be clear, this is free cash flow that is entirely attributable to Newmont's accounts enabling us to provide industry's leading returns. With that, I will hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on Slide 11.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom. Before jumping into the regions, I'll start with a general COVID update. Across our portfolio, we've continued our wide ranging controls and safety protocols to place the health, safety and wellbeing of our teams and our communities above all else. While we've had employees and contractors test positive for the virus, our effective testing, contact tracing and quarantine procedures have proven to be effective in mitigating the spread to other employees and local communities. In the second quarter, with five sites and care maintenance and all five sites were operational in the third quarter. Penasquito ramped up quickly and was achieving pre-COVID record levels in the plant by mid-June. Éléonore and Musselwhite ramped up early in the third quarter, and Yanacocha has returned to nearly full capacity. Cerro Negro is currently operating at about 60% of normal capacity, as the site continues to be impacted by ongoing travel restrictions in Argentina due to the virus. We're working closely with the local authorities and unions and are mitigating the efficiency impacts of reduced staffing levels by consolidating our mining and processing efforts in the near-term. I'm incredibly proud of the commitment of all of our teams during these difficult times, and the efforts that they have demonstrated day in, day out to work and produce safely. Turning to Slide 12 for an update on Australia's performance. At Boddington, we delivered solid third quarter production on the back of higher grades, which partially offset the wet weather that impacted mining productivity. As the stripping campaign winds down, we expect to benefit from higher grades through 2022. Boddington is expected to finish the year strongly with higher production and lower operational costs in the fourth quarter. The Autonomous Haulage System is progressing well, and remains on track to be fully operational in the first half of 2021, which will further enhance Boddington safety and productivity, while also extending mine life. The team continues to work very closely with Kant, as we prepare to become the world's first open pit goldmine with an Autonomous Haulage Truck fleet. The Kant 9-star system has been installed, and we’re expediting the delivery of the AHS trucks with 14 of the 29 arriving before year-end ahead of schedule. Tanami delivered another strong quarter with higher grades which helped offset COVID-related travel restriction and quarantine protocols that impacts productivity. The team remains focused on improving productivity through optimized shift, roster, and flight schedules. And despite the challenges over the course of 2020, Tanami remains on track to produce 500,000 ounces this year. Tanami Expansion 2 is progressing well, with around 40% of engineering work complete and close to 20% of the overall project complete. Earlier this month, we achieved a significant milestone completing the pilot hole, which provides us the ability and guidance we need to be able to develop a new 5.4 meter wide shaft from both the top and the bottom. Construction for the camp is well underway with around 75% of the new surface buildings in place. We continue to review the schedule and capital for this project to understand the full impact of potential delays due to the ongoing impact of COVID. Looking further ahead, we have significant near-mine exploration upside with extensions to existing deposits and at Oberon which has the potential to grow beyond 2 million ounces. Oberon is an open pit deposit located only 28 kilometers to the north of the Tanami Underground mine and has a potential to grow production to the operation beyond the current 500,000 ounces per year. As Tom mentioned, Oberon is in prefeasibility, and we've been remotely progressing our study work by evaluating mine planning scenarios and resource level updates. Recently, we resumed fieldwork after working in close collaboration with traditional owners to access the area and safely remobilize our hydrogeological drilling efforts. Exploration drilling is planned to resume after the upcoming wet season. Turning to Africa on Slide 13. As a team, we delivered solid third quarter performance with higher throughput and recoveries and we expect to reach higher grades in the fourth quarter, which will continue through 2021. At Ahafo, our investment in this world-class asset continues to deliver value. Our transition to a more productive underground mining method is to become the ground is progressing very well with development rates ahead of schedule. During the quarter, we ramped up to mining four to five stores concurrently in various locations of the mine, reducing congestion and increasing tonnages. Higher grades from the underground will help offset the stricken campaigns in the Awonsu and Subika open pits through next year. And at Ahafo North, we continue to advance the permitting process with the Ghana EPA and the team is focused on engineering and design work, as well as construction, procurement and community planning. As Tom mentioned, we remain firmly on track for a full fund's decision in 2021. When approved, our plans include building a standalone mill to produce approximately 250,000 ounces per year, over a 13-year mine life for an investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. And Ahafo North functional and technical resources will be supported from our current Ahafo operation, leveraging our proven operating model to reduce duplication in the region. Turning to our South America operations on Slide 14. Merian delivered solid third quarter performance as we processed stockpiles to help offset more tonnes mined, and we expect higher grades in the fourth quarter as we advance into the harbor ore. Yanacocha ramped up from 80% capacity in July to near full capacity in September. In the third quarter we processed our higher leach tonnes and return to more normal levels of throughput in the mill. And as expected, the inability to place leach tonnes in the second quarter will impact Yanacocha through 2020. But the team is working very hard to improve leach cycle times. At Cerro Negro, we're focused on operating as efficiently as possible to help mitigate the ongoing impacts of the travel restrictions caused by the virus. As a result, we're currently running the mill in campaigns, and the team continues to demonstrate resiliency despite facing inclement weather in the third quarter, and complexities of managing varying workforce availability changes. Mining is focused on development in the Marianas complex, but we are forecasting a slower ramp-up delaying access to higher grade stores into 2021, while we work with the authorities on a longer-term plan to return to normal operations by the end of the year. It is worth noting that Cerro Negro is only approximately 4% to Newmont's year production. So as Tom previously mentioned, we're well on track to deliver our 2020 guidance. Looking ahead, we remain very excited about Cerro Negro which has the potential to become the largest gold producer in South America. We have more than doubled our land position, and the mine and its surrounding areas are highly prospective and under explored. Our exploration team has identified significant district's field potential with more than 100 million prospects and ranked Cerro Negro as one of the most prospective land packages in our entire global portfolio. We're also very excited about Yanacocha Sulfides progressing to a full fund's decision in 2021 and we will continue to share additional details as our definitive feasibility study progresses. So wrapping up with North America on Slide 15. Peñasquito delivered solid third quarter performance as we safely and efficiently ramped up from care and maintenance. While the site continues to manage through COVID-related workforce challenges, we've been able to maintain our record levels through the plant and we also successfully completed a two week mill maintenance shutdowns in September, setting the operation up for a strong fourth quarter. Our full potential program continues to drive value from this world-class asset. And we’re currently focused on improving fragmentation through our blasting process and we continue to make enhancements to the front-end of the mill to further improve throughput. In addition, we fully ratified the sustainable agreement with the Cedros community in August, which also helps us to explore our large land package that is currently only 20% explored. At Musselwhite, we successfully ramped up from care maintenance in the third quarter, and we started stockpile processing. And I'm delighted to say that we achieved mechanical completion of the conveyor system yesterday and have started the important process of wet commissioning. Over the coming weeks, the conveyors will be tested to ensure all components of the conveyor belts are safe and fully operational as expected. And I very much look forward to completing the full commissioning and reaching nameplate capacity of the belts in December. Also, just last week, this project completed over 100,000 hours without a lost time injury. Again, I'm very proud of the great work of our sites and project teams, along with our contractor segmentation to ensure that we keep the health and the safety of every teammate in the forefront of every shift. Development rates at Musselwhite are exceeding plan and commissioning of the materials handling project has begun and is expected to be fully completed in November. We have also officially kicked-off our full potential program at Musselwhite building on the virtual efforts over the last several months. Overall, Musselwhite is very well-positioned to be fully up and running as we enter 2021 and we'll be back stronger than ever before. At Éléonore, our third quarter performance improved as the site ramped up from care maintenance. Ongoing COVID-related restrictions continue to impact staffing level, but development rates ramped-up in September and we're back to operating at normal capacity. Our site leadership team remains focused on improving efficiency and productivity and is driving fundamental changes as to how we operate at approximately 250,000 ounces of annual gold production with a sustainably lower cost base. We've made significant progress restructuring and reducing the overall number of site personnel. Yet morale has improved and production levels are on the rise, which speaks to the cultural change taking place at Éléonore. Through our full potential program, we've delivered $24 million of value year-to-date, and expect to continue to deliver meaningful cost improvements in 2021 and beyond. Earlier this year, we commissioned the Lower Mine Material Handling project safely and under budget, which will significantly streamline the transportation of water surface as we transition to higher production rates from the lower levels of the mine in the years ahead. Our exploration drills at Éléonore are returning very encouraging results, both laterally and at there and we're improving our understanding and interpretation of the geological model. We have also advanced our understanding of the District's geological framework, which will inform our 2021 drill program and targets less than 20% of the property drill tested to-date. Porcupine delivered solid third quarter results, and the site is improving underground development rigs with several new initiatives underway that will increase tonnes mined and processed in 2021. And CC&V also delivered strong results from an increase in tonnes mined and reaching higher grades at the bottom of the crescent [ph] pit. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial results on Slide 16.
Nancy Buese: Thanks Rob. Turning to Slide 17 for the financial highlights. We delivered our strongest ever quarterly performance across several financial metrics, including record free cash flow of $1.3 million, of which 97% is attributable to Newmont. Year-to-date, we have generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow of which 96% is attributable to Newmont. Other notable third quarter results include revenue of nearly $3.2 billion, adjusted net income of $697 million or $0.86 per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA of more than $1.6 billion, an increase of 54% from the prior-year quarter, and cash from continuing operations of $1.6 billion ending the quarter with a strong cash position of $4.8 billion. We ended the quarter with liquidity of nearly $8 billion and our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.4 times. Earlier this month, S&P moved Newmont's outlook from stable to positive and strong free cash flow prospects and reconfirmed our BBB credit rating. As a reminder, our financial results proportionally consolidate the company's ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mine that do not include the contributions from the company's investment in Pueblo Viejo which appears in equity income versus in our operating results. For the third quarter, our 40% of PV reported 87,000 ounces of production and would have added an additional $115 million of EBITDA. Turning to Slide 19 for a review of our earnings per share in more detail. Third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $611 million or $0.76 per share. Adjustments included $0.07 related to the change in fair value of our equity investments, $0.03 related to incremental COVID specific costs such as additional screening protocols, transportation costs, and community fund disbursement, $0.10 related to pension settlement changes related to the Nevada Gold mine transaction, $0.03 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance, and $0.07 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we've reported third quarter adjusted net income of $0.86 per diluted share. While the adjusted EBITDA for approximately $32 million of non-recurring incremental COVID specific costs from our third quarter net income, we did not adjust out approximately $35 million of care and maintenance costs to Yanacocha, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite ramping up in the third quarter. With that, I'll hand it over to Tom on Slide 19.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Turning now to Slide 20. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged and continues to balance the following three priorities: reinvesting in our business through disciplined investments in exploration and organic growth projects; maintaining financial strength and flexibility to sustain the business across cross cycles; and returning cash to shareholders. Newmont continues to set new standards as the clear industry leader in shareholder return which we further differentiated with a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced yesterday, bringing our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share and an annualized dividend rate to $1.50 per share. This was our second substantial dividend increase this year, demonstrating the strength and stability of our business. Turning to Slide 21 for more details. During 2019 and 2020, we'll have returned more than $2.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, an amount that is more than a total of our next eight competitors combined. Our employees' take the share third quarter dividend represents a 186% increase from the third quarter dividend in 2019 and highlights the strength of our financial position and our ability to continue kind of industry-leading dividend, mostly simultaneously investing and develop our most profitable projects. Our most recent dividend increase was the same within our newly established dividend framework. This framework provided our shareholders with the stability of advice annualized dividend of $1 per share calibrated at a $400 gold price assumption. And the potential to receive 40% to 60% of the incremental free cash flow generated at gold prices above $1,200 per ounce. Our third quarter dividend was calibrated at a conservative and stable $1,500 gold price assumption. As we have disclosed previously, Newmont generates incremental free cash flow of approximately $400 million for every $100 change in the gold price above $1,200. So at an assured $1,500 gold price, we would generate approximately $1.2 million of incremental free cash flow annually. Our third quarter dividend increase was calibrated to share 40% of that incremental $1.2 million free cash flow that Newmont will generate at an assured $1,500 gold price. That 40% is approximately $490 million. This equates to $0.60 per share annualized, an increase of $0.60 per share annualized have ramped $1 per share dividend. As a result, we’re pleased to offer our shareholders an annualized dividend of $1.50 per share. We chose a conservative $1,500 assumed gold price for the calibration of our third quarter dividend to maintain financial discipline and prudence as well as to instill stability and predictability into our dividend increase framework. We will typically reassess the gold price semiannually and recommend incremental dividend increases when we believe gold prices have revised at levels of at least $300 per ounce higher than they applied to establish our prior dividend increase. While the dividend will be fetched quarterly by our board, the framework is planning to ensure stability and predictability and we will evaluate the additional dividend in gold price increments of approximately $300 per ounce. In addition to this framework, we had a number of tools about deploying excess cash based upon the circumstances at the time. These include further strengthening the balance sheet for debt repayments, opportunistic share buybacks, and additional dividends. Our commitment to industry-leading shareholder returns is evidenced by our track record, and we're confident in our operation delivery and discipline will enable us to continue to enhance that record outperformance. With that, I will wrap it up on Slide 22. Over the last 18 months, Newmont has assembled the gold industry's leading portfolio, our world-class operations and projects in top tier jurisdictions and will deliver more than 7 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade and beyond. Our ability to generate substantial free cash flow across the thought process is unmatched and our significantly reaching high gold prices was demonstrated by our record third quarter free cash flow of $1.3 billion. As we continue in our 100th year, Newmont is leading the gold mining industry with a foundation that is stronger than ever, and a proven strategy to deliver long-term value while improving lives. I'm very excited about what the future holds at Newmont and I look forward to keeping you updated on our performance. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for opening the line for questions.
Operator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Fahad Tariq with Credit Suisse.
Fahad Tariq: Hi, good morning, just one question for me. I didn't see in the presentation, anything on synergy targets and what maybe if that's changed or not. But in any case, can you provide some color on -- is the cash flow synergy targets still $500 million for next year? How is that progressing? And anything else you could tell us on that front would be great.
Tom Palmer: Okay, thanks, Fahad, and good morning. I will talk regarding some cash results and then give you some full results of where we're delivering net value. Yes, we're on track to deliver facility targets, as we've committed, $500 million next year is still very much our commitment that's incorporated in our long-term guidance. I will update our long-term guidance in December in accordance with that. Just this week we have been meeting with our board to review our plan, which forms the basis of our guidance. But I remain very confident we will deliver at least $500 million of free cash flow next year. And as I say, it is still already in our long-term guidance. Rob, you want to give a few stories [ph].
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom and thanks for the question, Fahad. I find a way the engine of our predominance is in Penasquito and that team continues to do particularly well and have over exceeded this year. And as a remainder, the key areas that we're focused on are primarily the front-end of the process plan to allow more water flow through the mill. And we've successfully done that in states. In terms of the mining initiatives, it is about improving the fragmentation to enable more ducting through the plant, but also just bringing greater and greater discipline into how we blast, how would you market, how the shovels dig, et cetera. But beyond that, we've also moved into the total cost of ownership and the supply chain side of things. So, the procurement of non-OEM engineered parts, just to name a few, but we've got 45 initiatives on the order and they're all delivering good value. So very, very pleased with how things are going.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tyler Langton with JP Morgan.
Tyler Langton: Good morning, hope everyone's doing well. Just first question, I guess with sort of COVID cases rising. I guess is there do you see any increased risk of the shutdown at the mines, especially, I guess, the mines that were previously impacted. And then just with the Cerro Negro, I guess it's operating at 65%. Is it really to get back to 100% of it really just based on having travel restrictions ease or I guess other sort of alternatives you can look at?
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Tyler. Thank you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Cerro Negro operation. The constraints are all around the travel restrictions, but everyone in Argentina will be managing to keep people safe and healthy. We continue to apply our kinds of protocols with discipline across every one of our 12 managed operations, no matter where they're in the world. So in Australia, where there is no spread, there is no community virus in the Western Australia or the Northern Territory with Boddington, and Tanami respectively. We still maintain all of our protocols at those operations to ensure that we manage the risk of this nasty virus spreading. We still have some 10,000 people who are not an operating partner and office environment working virtually, again to protect the health and safety and safety of the communities in which we live and work. Rob Atkinson will give you a story of around Penasquito of the work that's being done, which will be mirrored across every one of our operations to ensure that we keep people health and safety, it's a good story that really demonstrates the extra effort that people are going through, the resilience in our business and why I'm so incredibly proud of our Newmont workforce. Rob?
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom. And really just to build on that is that it also highlights how Newmont is living and managing the constitution with the virus. The Penasquito to give everybody on the line, a sense that when we talk about COVID testing, it's easy to think, yes, that's fairly simple. But in Mexico, we've got 18 testing centers, we've got seven at various airports throughout Mexico, we've got seven at various major bus stations throughout Mexico. And we've got four testing stations onsite, that that also is required to staff those up with nurses and we've got 56 nurses and personnel operating those 18 centers. And as you can imagine, since COVID started, we have performed 10s and 10s of thousands of tests to make sure that our people are safe to go to the site. And also we're testing before people leave the site, so they can go back to the communities safely and with the full knowledge that are clear the virus. But I think that story from Penasquito really highlight just as Tom said, the effort and the commitment that our teams have to make sure that we operate throughout this virus very, very safely.
Tyler Langton: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then just at the two projects for next year for Yanacocha and Ahafo North, can you maybe give us a sense when you actually might make a decision? And is there any risk just from COVID sort of pushing those decisions out?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tyler. I will pick up Yanacocha -- Ahafo North will come first, it will be early in the new [indiscernible] Ahafo North which is working through with the API on the final permit. It's absolutely down the middle of our warehouse. The blueprints are the same as the original Ahafo, [indiscernible] very, very straightforward mine to do, I repeat a mine mill, 20, 30 kilometers from existing Ahafo operation. And a lot of the work particularly in the first four months is a relocation of the road and then clearing of top soil and starting the initial [indiscernible] all of which is done with local Ghanaian workforce. And we build off the project that is still in place at Ahafo having just recently finished the Ahafo mill expansion and to do underground, so very well-positioned with Ahafo North and lots of water bodies closed, [indiscernible] appears to be closed. At Yanacocha Sulfides, in second half of next year, still doing the final engineering work around the feasibility study and again pretty straightforward in terms of bringing that project 12-months approved. So the layback of the existing Yanacocha pit mine today at Yanacocha starts deploying equipment to that layback. And at the Yanacocha underground mine which we have already developed quite extensively so both [indiscernible] evolve, will advance. The key word is around the construction of a concentrator and the – we will apply on the existing footprint. And again, as you approve that project and do your early works, a lot of that is civil works to lay the foundations for substantial processing plants, so not so unique COVID-related restrictions to being able to bring that project on as we enrich them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes with TD Securities.
Greg Barnes: Thank you, Tom, just rehashing your commentary on the dividend framework. Did I understand that you will reassess the dividend every six months now going forward based on the gold price?
Tom Palmer: Our board will look at every quarter, Greg. But I'll look back at a semiannual gold price period. So if you look at the discussion we went through with the board this week include that dividend, we look back the semiannual period track on is the first half of this year, gold was averaging around $1,550 for the first half of the year, we took conservative view to lower that to $1,500 and applied a 40% on the lower end of that range to that $1,500. So we'll look every quarter as a board but they look back over that semiannual period.
Greg Barnes: Okay. So in Q1, if you look back over the second half of 2020 let’s say the average $1,900 which is exactly will, you do something like $1,800 as the basis of dividend?
Tom Palmer: I think as you use our framework and my -- did those calculations, and you saw that in your report this morning, that is absolutely the discussion that our board will be going through. So you could do that calculation side of 40% to 60%, could be somewhere between 0 to 20, 0 to 40, that would be subject to the board, looking at not just the gold price but all of a number of other factors. But that's just sort of discussion and we'll be having that framework allow us to have that discussion, and allows us you and the investment community to make those determination.
Greg Barnes: And since I'm interested in your comments on copper and the projects in your portfolio, is that an expression of increasing interest in copper or just a factoid out there that those projects have copper exposure from an interesting angle?
Tom Palmer: Yes, it's just purely a factoid. We don't need to do anything other than develop an organic project pipeline, we'll get a natural exposure to copper at a time it will be an important thing in the global community.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Terry: Hi, Tom, Nancy and Rob, a couple of questions from me, first on the cash balance now at $4.8 billion, just seeing that the mechanics of that, looking back, I guess the last couple of years, you have had a balance about $2 billion or so I think. But generally, it's a reasonably high cash balance. But as you think about going forward, as a cash yield, you pay somewhat into dividends, and then you show it on our numbers become net cash relatively quickly. How do you think about the actual cash balance? So what you'll do with that is that you're going to be used to pay debt, or what physical will you do with the actual cash? Thanks.
Nancy Buese: Yes, absolutely. I'll take that one. You got this right. We have indicated publicly that we would like to keep cash balances, somewhere in the $2 billion -- $2 billion to $3 billion range. And I think in the time of COVID uncertainty that remains prudent. We've also indicated that we’ll continue to use that cash for things like paying down our 2021 through 2023 debt, things like the share buybacks that we initiated last year, and certainly contributions to the dividend as well as reinvesting in our business. So all of those things combined will give us that financial flexibility, and optionality. But yes, in today's world, I think holding a bit more cash on the balance sheet is certainly something we'll continue to do.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Nancy. And then just in terms of the project pipeline on Slide 9, you talked about Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides, 750, I think so the Ahafo North CapEx and Yanacocha Sulfides' second half next year decision, can you just remind us the time period and the rough capital that that would be spent over, I think it's a pretty long-dated project, but just wanted to get an update. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Chris. It's round down to $2 billion where 51.35% is in Yanacocha, so it's roughly a $1 billion to Newmont's account and its three-year development. But you look at the big -- the three big capital projects, and if you look at our -- going to model our development capital going out on the back of those, certain pieces for Tanami, certain pieces for Ahafo North, and a billion for Yanacocha Sulfides over the next four maybe five years. That's about roughly I'll say on development capital. [indiscernible] and that's another important factor behind the -- we've got the primaries, we've got a steady $1 dollars in sustaining capital, steady $400 million combined between advanced projects and exploration, and roughly a steady $800 million to $1 billion in development capital in mine time. Our prime work that allow us to share excess cash to our shareholders.
Chris Terry: Okay, that makes sense. So next year, those two main updates and then looking at Slide 9, any of the other sort of pre-feasibility type projects will move to the next stage?
Tom Palmer: Yes, I think the ones to keep in mind that will mean our project pipeline is what we don't show and is seeking a shaft at Turquoise Ridge around 38.5% of that, our [indiscernible] expansion which we earn 40% of that getting close to full fund, so there are a couple of other very important catalysts within the Newmont portfolio and then we will be continuing to optimize the three big mega projects will operate more at a norm. And we have to do one of those at one time, very end of that mix. So far more and overall on the second underground of Ahafo, Apensu moving underground Ahafo seems to layback [indiscernible] push through execution. And then Coffee, we’re just starting up a drilling program in calendar winter. And Coffee would be another potential Ahafo North type project that we could be bringing through the follow-on, we’ve got Tanami 2, Ahafo North, it’s Coffee a potential follow-on from that so plenty of activity happening in that feasibility study front.
Chris Terry: Okay, that's clear. And the last one for me with the automation at Boddington due I think early next year what's the latest thoughts on how long you'd assess that for before you'd maybe look at other sites and rolling that out on other operations?
Tom Palmer: We don't need to do much assessing at the time relative further, I implemented the first autonomous mine in the Pilbara almost 10 years ago. So it is proven technology, there's no piloting or assessing, it's changing a fleet either, and it's going to be a business case. So once you went through the existing operations and you got to have enough log in front of you and a value proposition to change that obviously. Boddington presented that business case, so there has to be business case. And then just some, very important part of that statement is improving lives. And we're going to think about those communities in which we live and work and whether Autonomous Haulage is part of that equation when you think about some of the locations that we're in. So we'll continue to assess whether there's opportunities for Autonomous Surface Haulage there is plenty of opportunities for underground autonomous operation, and we're doing quite a bit of that already. So I expect to see more underground autonomous before another open pit. The real opportunity for us is to increase the value proposition around those mega projects with sort of pre-feasibility. When you have within your portfolio an autonomous operation, you can train and you will bolster [ph] in that operations and underpin a base case for those projects, too bigger risk to be doing your first radio with a sort of fall into a brand new project. So that's one of the strategic elements of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni with CIBC World Markets.
Anita Soni: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question I would want to delve a little bit further into Slide 9 and Slide 10, which was the capital and the projects? So I think you just mentioned that Coffee, you were talking about them in the context of Tanami and Ahafo North. So do I understand mean that the capital would be in the range of $700 million to $800 million? Is that what you trend out that way?
Tom Palmer: Not quite, Anita. I think it'd be a lower number. But I categorized by the two broad categories I have for projects are major and mega. For major project, anything $300 million, could be anything from $300 million up to $1 billion. And then mega project is anything greater than $1 billion, that's actually consistent from my experience with the projects, different way we implement those two types of projects. So Coffee is similar size to Ahafo North, more accountable, I'd say different place of the work. So --
Anita Soni: So it's more along the range of like 250,000 ounces, 300,000 ounces rather than five.
Tom Palmer: Yes, yes.
Anita Soni: Okay, all right. Second question. Just, I'm trying to understand this free cash flow profile that you have a little bit further. Not Included in there is the Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides and obviously all the other projects that we've talked about, but what is included is Tanami which is an execution, right?
Tom Palmer: That's correct, Anita. So that's one of those projects moving to full fund. Then those projects will take some of the free cash flow that we're showing there, however that's only showing free cash flow from gold. It's not showing the free cash flow from the other metals, so that that challenge you read from both of those perspectives.
Anita Soni: All right. But it does include the gold all that kicks in for those but I think was only kicked in around 2024, 2025 anyway, right?
Tom Palmer: Those projects are in the back-end -- back end of five years. But they are very important projects, I'm excited to be able to bring them forward and show you what those projects stood for production protocol and cost.
Anita Soni: Okay. And then with respect to exploration, that's something that's I am just interested, looking at the exploration budget going forward next year, do you guys have an idea of whether or not they'll see the same increase? Or, what are you looking at this stage?
Tom Palmer: This is the time year-on-year [indiscernible] in exploration, Anita, 80% of that's being in Newmont, it’s been around conversions and extending lives.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen with Bank of America.
Mike Jalonen: Hi, Tom, and everyone. So you intrigued me on the MR open pit Century project have gotten pretty quiet since the merger, it's coming back to life. What's changed from the prior owner was saying about Century versus smaller pits not moving any buildings. Just curious, what kind of tax rate could it be? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Mike and we're really pleased with the question from you each quarter. Look forward to have a question from you each quarter. I will pass it over to Rob to give you some color on that.
Rob Atkinson: Hey, Mike. Good morning. It really is the simplicity of it and the lack of complexity, to be honest, that obviously is an existing name that just needs to be watered, we've got a good geological model there, we can use the current plant infrastructure. And it also provides us with kind of 10, 11,12 years of mine life that allows us to further explore the bottom, the oil pond and the do orebodies. So it really was just a fairly simple value equation. And we just don't know the simplest road, but also the most value accretive road.
Mike Jalonen: So where do you go from here with this project? I'm trying to get some numbers on some timeline?
Rob Atkinson: We’re just doing the studies at the moment. And as that slides indicated is that we’re still at the early stages. So I would expect we'll be able to give you more of a timeline in next year, once we've progressed a bit more. But just kind of rule of thumb that we're expecting, it's going to be a three to four year kind of planning, preparation stage. And then we're expecting around the 12 year, 13 year kind of life at between 150,000 to 200,000 and scheme of things. So that's broad brush, but certainly make its early days, the team is working hard on at the moment to come up with suitable main designs and watching schedules and certainly in the New Year, we'll be able to provide more color.
Mike Jalonen: Okay. And I guess that's turning to Oberon, I can't remember if that was discussed when we were at Tanami there in November, a couple of years ago. Maybe just remind me where that is and to set things pretty exciting.
Tom Palmer: Yes, Mike it’s again I wasn't on that tour, which I think might -- we have touched on it in terms of geological overview that Chris Robinson peaked, although we've done a pad or drilling since your update literally.
Rob Atkinson: No, not one. But it literally is just a stone's throw away. It's less than 30 kilometers from the underground.
Tom Palmer: Hope you had a strong arm.
Rob Atkinson: And certainly, there's a huge amount of synergies that we can get there. It is an open pit, but it's also got underground potential as well. So in terms of proximity, it’s very, very close, which allows us to potentially use the existing infrastructure. And that's certainly one that, the team is focused very hard on, as I mentioned that the drilling program, we've struggled this year because of COVID, not being allowed to drill on average on land. But we've got those approvals and hold for the right season where you can [indiscernible] pad again.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.
Michael Dudas: Yes, hi. Good afternoon every person and [indiscernible] everyone. Just maybe, you mentioned briefly about ESG in your prepared remarks, et cetera. Thinking about from the energy standpoint, when you're looking at your development projects, obviously you're probably really looking like, I've always looked them from the best environmental and social efforts from a development standpoint, but any queries or thoughts on less decarbonizing from that standpoint, or, are you looking into investments that you haven't talked about until the development work, that may lead towards some requirement versus to improve that metric from a currency standpoint?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Michael. We're quoting what amount until our 2030 targets, but we're resetting out our mission targets both [indiscernible] but to a science base and we’re also providing an aspirational target for 2050. And because we've got a long line to follow, we can actually see after that far, and just talk about how we support the global community in terms of how we develop our projects and our operations. We have -- our portfolio had a natural move to underground mining. So as we move to more underground and open pit, we reduce both our emissions and intensity and carbon sizes, we look at where our power sources are coming from. But all that we can do to convert power and we’re pulling power off the grid, what the supplies are doing, how we can encourage supplies to, encourage conditioned intensity, for instance, in Ghana we supported installation of solar power cells that go into the grid as part of that, that process. And then if we're serious, then we need to be thinking about what we're doing with our investments to ensure that we’re around with it, we're reducing our emission intensity, so that is the move to more electric equipment. The move to autonomous haulage allow us to diesel fired trucks and you're more efficient, because the automation doesn't have the human element in terms of how our engines are operated. We then look at different fuel sources. We already apply a carbon price to some of our key investments $20 a ton and $40 a ton to assess what we do. Our full potential program, our full continuous improvement program, a key element of that is improving energy efficiency, which brings improve the cost, improve productivity, and reduce emissions. And we need to think about and that the industry needs to be part of the discussion around where are we putting our money, where our amount is with these targets and with our explorations and starting to develop technologies that can ultimately lead to a carbon neutral world and make the device we're having right now. I think if you want to be a leader in this industry, then you have to be demonstrating through your actions, the industry leadership. So we're having those debates and stay tuned we're going to talk about our new targets next month. And we continue to talk about how we can minimize in weeks and months beyond that.
Rob Atkinson: So if I could just add just to build on that, Michael it's Dean Gehring, who leads our Technical Services also employing some key specialists in this domain. And we've got power and electricity specialists, which will really help us in terms of not only managing the current power that we're pulling from that, whether it's the stranded power or whether it's from the grid. But also working with the suppliers, as Tom said about the future, whether it's gas plants, solar plants, other type of electricity plants. So again, it isn't just where the targets is, we're actually building the teams that we need to do that work.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Tom Palmer for any closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you operator and thank you everyone for joining us today. And please you and your families stay safe and well. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont’s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide two, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at Newmont.com. And now, I’ll turn it over to Tom on Slide three.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Jess. Good morning and thank you all for joining our call. Newmont continues to manage through the COVID pandemic from a position of strength and our diverse balance portfolio of world-class assets provide stable production with significantly reach to rising gold prices. Turning to slide four, for a look at our second quarter highlights. Our resilient operating model supported the delivery of solid quarterly despite the ongoing impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business. We slightly resumed operations at Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Éléonore, Peñasquito and Musselwhite. The five sites placed in the care and maintenance earlier this year. In the second quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,097 per ounce.  We generated operating cash flow of $668 million and free cash flow of $388 million. And we continue to safely advanced project work at Tanami Expansion 2, Subika Underground and Musselwhite. Our investment-grade balance sheet combined with liquidity of $6.7 billion provides us with significant financial strength and flexibility. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and have lowered our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.6 times. We declared a second quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, which remains the highest yielding dividend among senior gold producers. It is also worth noting that over last 18 months Newmont has returned more than $2 billion to shareholders, demonstrating our track record of industry-leading returns. At Newmont, we have a fundamental belief that strong environmental, social and governance performance is not only the right thing to do, it is also an indicator of a well-managed business that deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. In June, we published our 16th Annual Sustainability Report, which details Newmont's strategy, approach, target and performance related to material ESG issues ranging from climate, water, tilings, value sharing and human rights through the corporate governance, tax strategy, ethics and compliance. The report transparently covers what we've done well where we have lessons and how we plan to improve. And I encourage you to take some time to read more about our efforts in this space by visiting the sustainability section of our website at newmont.com. Turning to slide five. Combined with our proven and resilient operating model, Newmont's deep bench of experience leaders and mature systems remained a competitive advantage in these unprecedented times. We will continue to maintain our wide range in COVID protocols at all sites, ensuring that we keep the health, safety and well-being of that people and communities above all else.
Also: Two weeks ago, I visited Boddington operation in Western Australia. And even though Western Australia currently has no community spread of this virus, our robust controls remain in place at Boddington. It was great to experience firsthand the work all the operations are doing to ensure that we do not lose focus on protecting our workforce and communities during this time. The confidence and pride at Boddington was very high. And our teammate is absolutely focused on safely delivering to their plans. I am incredibly proud of all of our employees for how they are the coming the challenges we've faced this year with focus and resolve. Across the globe we are finding new ways to move the business forward, by better leveraging technology, fostering greater collaboration and building a deep sense of community despite having to work apart. We are also strengthening our relationships with external stakeholders, by embracing our core values of safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility in every engaging with them. Early this year, we established a $20 million global community support fund to assist host communities, governments and employees. With input from local stakeholders, we identified three focus areas; employees and community health, food security and local economic resilience, to ensure that our financial support will have the most positive impact and reach those who need it most. Our efforts have included, the provision of personal protective equipment for frontline workers, the construction of an oxygen plant for regional hospital, partnering with local food banks for families in need, and micro lending and revolving loans for businesses in host communities. Sadly, one area we have seen significant need as a result of COVID is domestic violence. So we have also partnered with agencies who serve women and children in need of safer environments. To-date, we have distributed nearly $6 million with another $4 million in process, pending completion of a governance process designed to ensure that the funds go with our intended and they utilized effectively. We committed to managing our fund with collaboration and transparency. And you can find our regularly updated list of all recipient organizations on our website. These efforts will continue in the weeks and months to come, so that our host communities can thrive long after this pandemic is behind us. Turning to look at our global diverse portfolio on slide six. Among our 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, we have eight world-class assets, each of which deliver more than 500,000 ounces of consolidated production per year, and all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per gold equivalent ounce and a mine life would exceeds for 10 years. Importantly, all are located in top tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B ratings ranges by each of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. In addition to our eight existing world-class assets, Newmont has two emerging world-class assets with the Yanacocha in Peru, and Merian in Suriname. These emerging assets within our portfolio offer upside through further optimization and development over the coming years. We also have an unmatched project pipeline with Tanami Expansion 2 being executed. And both the Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides advancing towards full funds decisions next year. It is from this foundation that we can create additional value as we optimize our longer term projects and deliver decades of profitable production. Turning to slide seven. Our stable production profile will generate more than 6 million ounces of gold per year through the 2029. This decade long production profile is underpinned by eight world-class assets, our industry leading exploration program and there are three key development projects, Tanami 2, which is an execution, along with a Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides. This profile is further enhanced with over $1.5 billion per year of additional revenue, producing between 1.2 million to 1.4 million gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc, Peñasquito and copper at Boddington. Combined, we will deliver well over 7 million gold equivalent ounces per year for the next decade, the most of any company in our industry. Turning to our free cash flow generation potential on slide eight. We expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the gold price cycle. For every $100 increasing gold price above our base assumption, Newmont delivers approximately $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1200 gold price assumption, our base free cash flow would still total more than $5 billion over the next five years. And the current gold prices, our portfolio will generate more than $17 billion of free cash flow over that same timeframe. In addition, we have the potential for further upside with tailwinds from favorable ore prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Looking forward, we are well-positioned to continue executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long term value creation. With that, I'll hand it over to Rob to discuss our operational performance on slide nine.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide 10. The strength of our diversified global portfolio along with our operating model and capable workforce continues to be a key differentiator for Newmont during this unprecedented time. During the second quarter, we executed safe and efficient restart plans at Cerro Negro, , Yanacocha, Éléonore, Peñasquito and Musselwhite, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. As Tom mentioned we continue to maintain the extensive protocols across all of our sites to ensure the health and safety of our workforce in nearby communities. And we have been operating with a significantly reduce site based workforce and remain committed to the safe delivery of our plan. As you will recall, we made the important and proactive decision to continue paying our employees through June, despite the status of their operation, which has impacted our second quarter unit costs. It was absolutely the right decision. And it has been an essential factor to allow the safe and efficient ramp up of our operations with the full support of our workforce and local communities. For the second quarter, we incurred approximately $195 million of care and maintenance costs, and approximately $33 million of COVID-19 specific costs related to additional health and safety procedures, transportation costs, and community support fund disbursements across our entire portfolio. Over the last few months, we've seen near term headwinds as our increased health and safety protocols impact operating efficiencies, particularly in the mine, with staggered pre-start meetings, the elimination of hot [ph] heating and transport changes impacting productivity. However, we've been able to partially offset these impacts by reducing the number of people working at site, implementing new rosters and taking advantage of downtime to plan for longer term efficiency improvements. Now we'll touch on these further in the regional overviews. I'm very proud of our team and what they've safely accomplished during this unprecedented time. But as we continue navigating through this global pandemic, I can assure you, our focus to drive efficiency and productivity gains is more important and acute than ever. And we are well-positioned to deliver stronger second half of the year. Coming now to slide 11, for an update on Australia's performance. At Boddington, we began to reach high-grade in the south pit. An earlier this month, the team achieved 21 million tonnes through the plan year to-date, which puts them on track to exceed 40 million tonnes by year end. As our three-year stripping campaign nears completion. We will continue to mine higher grades into 2021. We continue to invest in the Autonomous Haulage System, which we expect to be fully operational next year. Tanami delivered yet another solid quarter, and the team is continually looking for ways to improve the way we work. Just recently, the mine implemented even time rosters to improve productivity and shift change these. With the interstate border closures in place in Australia, I am incredibly appreciative for many of the team and their families for their willingness to temporarily relocate to Darwin from other parts of Australia, allowing us to continue safely operating through this period. The Tanami Expansion 2 project is also progressing and all critical activities have continued. Working with our EPC Worley [ph] we are now approximately 30% through the engineering design, and the overall project is about 10% complete. Travel restrictions did impact second quarter development rates. However, we recently added a fourth crew to help mitigate the efficiency losses. In early July, the box cut for the production Chase Foundation was completed, and we placed the second raisebore on surface. So overall things are tracking well. And two weeks ago, the first buildings for the new camp near the underground mine arrived on site after traveling over 2000 miles. The camp will initially be used for the construction crews and when the project is completed, it will be repurposed to accommodate our mining crews to improve fatigue management and save 80 minutes a day in travel time between the current camp and the mine. We are also progressing our study work of Oberon remotely including a review of surface layers, mine and process plant infrastructure options and updating the resource model. Our hydro-geological drilling has been delayed, but we are working with the traditional owners to access that area and see if we remobilize the team. The Oberon deposit continues to grow as an open pit opportunity and the potential to get beyond 2 million ounces as we define the high-grade structures and understand the upside of this prospective deposit, and how this further improves our production outlook. Australian's 2020 production and cost outlook is unchanged, with approximately 1.2 million ounces and $900 per ounce AISC. Turning to Africa on Slide 12. Ghana has seen an uptick in COVID cases over the last two months, but our teams at Akyem and Ahafo continue to adhere the strict protocols and on quarantine and contact tracing procedures have been effective and minimizing the impact to our operations. Our team delivered solid second quarter performance with higher throughput despite a plan maintenance shutdown, and expects to reach higher grade in the fourth quarter. At Ahafo, we continue to progress stripping at the Awonsu and Subika open pits, while advancing underground development for the updated mining method at Subika Underground. Development rate of Subika Underground are ahead of schedule, and we recently received the raisebore machine, which will further support development progress. The 2020 outlook for Africa is unchanged with 850,000 ounces at $870 for ounce AISC. As we expect a strong second half of the year with a half or reaching higher grade than the open pits and Subika ramping up times from the underground. Turning to slide 13 for an update on the Ahafo North project. The Ahafo District provides significant upside potential from the underground opportunities at Awonsu, Apensu and Subika as well as from Ahafo Mill [ph]. Located just 30 kilometers north of our existing Ahafo operation, it is the best on mine gold deposit in West Africa, with approximately 3.5 million ounces of open pit reserves, and more than 1 million ounces of indicated and inferred resource. Similar to Tanami in Australia, our ability to expand this prolific region is underpinned by our successful recent investments in Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground, which has created a very strong platform for our future. Our plans include building a standalone mill, and the project is expected to produce approximately 250,000 ounces per year over a 13-year mine life for an investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. Our project work continues remotely with a team focused on engineering and design work, as well as construction, procurement and community planning. We have also been able to advance the permitting process with the Ghana EPA through both virtual and limited face-to-face sessions. An earlier this month, we submitted our initial environmental impact statement for review. We also received engineering and design approval from the Ghana Highway Authority for the highway diversion and improvement project, which was a key milestone for the project. We remain on track for a full funds decision in 2021. Moving to our North America operations on slide 14. During the second quarter, the North America region resumed operations at the three sites that were previously in care and maintenance. At Peñasquito, we've been began a phase ramp up in mid-May consistent with the Mexican government's regulations. Government representatives visited the site, including the Federal Undersecretary of Mine to review our protocols, and said Peñasquito is a leading example for how all Mexican mines should operate during these times. We began ramping up the mill and mining activities at the beginning of June and were quickly back to pre-COVID at record levels in the plant by mid June. We remain very focused on delivering value from this world-class asset by applying our full potential program to eliminate constrains, reduce costs and increase productivity and ultimately allow us to extend mine life through resource conversion. As previously highlighted, we also recently completed a definitive agreement to resolve all outstanding disputes with the Cedros community, which was a significant milestone, and which now establishes as a clear path forward for both parties to develop a long term partnership to create value, and importantly, improve lives. This agreement was signed with the community elected representatives and will be ratified in the General Assembly that will take place when COVID-19 gathering restrictions are lifted by the government. With Porcupine and CC&V continued without major interruption during the second quarter. And in Porcupine we saw improved recoveries with a greater proportion of ore coming from the Subika underground. At Musselwhite, we resumed work on the conveying system in early June, after working closely with First Nations leaders and the provincial health authorities on the safe restart plan. By early July, our contract of cementation had its full project team on site, and we are on track to complete the conveyor installation by the end of 2020. The Musselwhite materials handling project will begin mobilizing for completion activities in September to align with the conveyor timeline. We restarted the mill for stockpile processing on June the 19th and resumed the underground mine development work at same time. Our full potential work at Musselwhite is progressing well. And our team successfully completed the diagnose phase entirely virtually in Ahafo Mill. From that work, the Underground work stream identified approximately 25 opportunities to improve development productivity, tracking performance and ore body modeling. I'm excited about future Musselwhite and the ability to drive valuable operational improvements in the year ahead. Turning to Éléonore. We restarted the mill in late May after approximately 60 days in care and maintenance. Earlier this year, the mine undertook a review of ground support conditions, and we completed some necessary rehabilitation one before ramping up production activities. We expect to reach more normal levels of production in August, as we manage through ongoing travel and logistical constraints. Construction on the lower mine materials handling system project resumed in early June with the conveyor belt installation and commissioning of the fresh rock breaker. We expect the project to be operational in mid August, streamlining the transportation of --suffers. From the beginning, we flagged that Éléonore was the operation requiring further optimization as Newmont's technical experts critically assess the asset and the opportunities to improve the geotechnical model. We remain positive on the value we can unlock from Éléonore. However, we are taking the proper time to truly integrate the updated geological and geotechnical models to deliver an optimized life of mine plan. As a result, we expect lower production baseline for Éléonore of approximately 250,000 ounces per year. And work is underway with support from our full potential program to ensure the cost base matches this production level. To support this important work, we've made a number of changes to the site leadership team since the beginning of the year, with a new general manager, mining manager, exploration manager, health, safety and security manager who are all now on board. This leadership team is driving fundamental changes to how we operate with a sharp focus on sustainable improvement choosing back to basics principles in order to build a strong foundation in the year ahead. The years ahead, the North America 2020 outlook has been updated to approximately 1.4 million ounces at $1,040 per ounce AISC, with an additional 880,000 gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead, and zinc. This outlook includes the impact the site previously in care and maintenance and the changes at Éléonore. Turning to South America, on slide 15. Merian delivered solid performance in the same quarter, as higher recoveries partially offset lower ton mine as the site managed through wet season impacts. The team also safely completed plan to reach higher grid as we transition to harder rock. The Yanacocha began ramping up in mid-May after being in care and maintenance for approximately 60 days. Mine and mill activities were suspended during the care and maintenance period. But we continued all critical activities such as water treatment, which enabled ongoing production from the leach pads. The mill restarted in mid May and mining activity resumed in late May. And we expect to reach full operations in September. We are placing Quecher Main ore on the new categorical leach pad since later this year. However Yanacocha's outlook has been updated to reflect leach cycle disruptions in 2020 from the timing of ore placement. At Cerro Negro, we took advantage of the approximately 60-day care and maintenance period to perform a significant amount of mill maintenance and modifications to improve throughput. The team is managing through several constraints including government and provincial travel restrictions, in addition to inclement winter weather. So the mine is currently operating at about 50% capacity. Given the site's that's mine constraint, we are running the mill in campaigns in order to ensure cost efficiency until we are back to normal mining reads. Though potential implementation is underway, and the priorities remain focused on back to basics mining practices, which includes improving development rates, ground control, and backfill practices. The 2020 outlook for Cerro Negro has been updated to include COVID related constraints and our ability to achieve improved development rates and access higher grid ore in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we remain excited about the potential to extend Cerro Negro's mine through our exploration program, and we recently secured a large land package of approximately 550 square kilometers near Cerro Negro. The South America 2020 outlook has been updated to just over 1.1 million ounces at approximately $1100 dollars per ounce AISC, which includes the impact on the COVID related constraints at Cerro Negro. We are also excited about Yanacocha sulphates progressing towards the full funds decision in 2021. So turning to slide 16. Yanacocha has been a cornerstone asset to the Newmont portfolio for decades, and we continue to see promising drilling results. As you can see here, the first phase of the sulphates project is focused on developing the most profitable deposits and is expected to produce approximately 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per annum through 2030 and extend Yanacocha operations into the 2040. As we advance towards a full funds decision next year, we look forward to providing more information on this exciting project in due course. So wrapping up with our 2020 outlook on slide 17. Despite the decision to place five operations in care and maintenance, we expect to produce approximately 6 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,015 per annum in 2020, with an additional 1 million gold equivalent ounces from core products. Compared to the outlook provided in mid May, production is unchanged. While our costs applicable to sales has been lowered at $760 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs is unchanged at $1,015 per ounce. Our sustaining capital has increased to $900 million as we've been able to ramp up faster than first anticipated at our operations previously in care and maintenance. Our total 2020 capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion as increases to sustaining capital are partly offset by further changes to the development capital schedule for Tanami Expansion 2 which they fair some spend to 2021. For exploration and advanced projects, we've lowered our 2020 investment to approximately $350 million. We are fortunate to have the largest gold reserves in our industry at 95.7 billion ounces, and we completed the majority of our reserve drilling in the first quarter. However, as we continue to focus on keeping our people safe, we currently expect to replace approximately 60% to 70% of our targeted reserves delivered by the drill bit from our manage operations in 2020. We also experienced some processing delays at the start of the pandemic, but are now seeing normal turnover times. We also restarted exploration mapping activities at coffee using 100% Yukon-based crew and we are prepared to restart greenfields like activities as soon as local restrictions are lifted in areas of Africa, Australia and South America. Our longer term target of organically replacing at least two-thirds of reserves depletion over the next 10 years remains firmly intact. The changes to the way we operate from COVID have been substantial. And as the pandemic continues to evolve with the potential for a second wave, its becoming more likely, we may have to take further measures to protect our workforce and our communities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial results on slide 18.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Turning to slide 19 for the financial highlights. Despite having five operations in care and maintenance, our financial performance improves significantly compared to the prior year quarter, demonstrating that tailwinds from favorable gold and oil prices and foreign exchange more than offset the COVID related impacts to our business. During the second quarter, Newmont delivered solid results with higher revenue of nearly $2.4 billion, despite fewer ounces sold, adjusted net income of $261 million or $0.32 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion. Cash from continuing operations was $668 million, and free cash flow was $388 million, and nearly six-fold increase quarter-on-quarter. Turning to slide 20, for review of our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $412 million or $0.51 per share. Adjustments included $0.28 related to the change in fair value of our equity investments, $0.04 related to incremental COVID specific costs, such as additional screening protocols, transportation costs, and community fund disbursements, $0.02 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance, and $0.03 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we've reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.32 per diluted share. While we adjusted approximately $33 million of non recurring incremental COVID specific costs from our second quarter net income, we did not adjust out approximately $195 million related to the five operations temporarily placed into care and maintenance. Costs here included wages, direct operating expenses, and non cash depreciation. It's worth noting that our A&I per share would have been $0.15 per share higher if we had adjusted for these costs. Turning to slide 21. As Tom mentioned, Newmont continues to manage through the COVID pandemic from a position of strength. There has been no change to our industry leading capital allocation priorities, which include maintaining and strengthening our investment grade balance sheets, growing our margins through the delivery of our full potential continuous improvement program, and growing our reserves and resources through discipline investments and organic growth. And finally, returning cash to our shareholders through a sector leading dividend. We ended the quarter with liquidity of $6.7 billion and our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.6 times. Newmont focus on leading shareholder returns remains stronger than ever, and we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.25 per share. Over the last six quarters, we have returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, a track record that demonstrates our commitment to providing the highest returns. Lastly, while the recent rise in gold prices notable, we will continue to use our conservative assumptions around $1200 mine plan and continue our discipline around capital allocation. We will also invest in profitable projects, return cash to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Excess cash flows generated from periods of higher gold prices could be used to further improve our balance sheet and provide additional returns to shareholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Tom to wrap up on slide 22.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Concluding on slide 23. Newmont's superior operating model combined with our incredibly talented and dedicated workforce, a key to maintaining our position as the world's leading gold company. Most businesses across the globe have faced unprecedented challenges this year. I am very proud of how we have responded and the Newmont is able to provide our stakeholders with a solid foundation in the midst of uncertainty. We have the industry's best portfolio, with world-class assets in top tier jurisdictions, largest gold reserve base of 96 million ounces, significant exposure to other metals, all of which positions Newmont to reliably produce more than 6 million ounces of gold every year for at least the next decade. And we will continue to apply Newmont's discipline we preserve to deliver cost and productivity improvements to expand margins. I'm very excited about what the future holds at Newmont, beginning with a strong second half of 2020. Thank you for your continued support. And please keep safe and well as we continue to navigate through this pandemic. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tyler Langton of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Yes. Good morning, Tom, Rob and Nancy. I hope you're all doing well. And thanks for taking the questions. Just to start, can you talk a little bit about the risks to production in the second half, like if COVID cases does increase from current levels around your operations? And I guess, specifically other actions you can take to sort of reduce the risks of having to just shut down the five operations that you previously put on care and maintenance? And is there sort of less risk at the operations that will never shut down?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tyler and good morning. I'll pick that one up and then maybe get Rob to provide a bit more color as well. We'll remain all of the protocols that we've had in place and had a place since March, store in many place even in those places, like Australia with Boddington and Tanami in both of those parts of Australia. There is no community spread. But this virus is nasty. It's terribly contagious. And we are keeping those protocols in place. That's not just the things we're doing on the operating sites around social distancing and hygiene. It's also about keeping people off the operating side if they're not part of the workforce required to operate and maintain the mine and the processing plants. So, this virus is still a wider run as we're seeing around the globe. So we are maintaining a discipline across every one of our operations in terms of those protocols. That's the best thing we can do, best things that we can control. We are concerned and monitoring carefully different parts of the world, but particularly through South America, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, those countries are still struggling terribly with this virus. And we're doing everything we can to support our folks in those parts of the world. And part of that is keeping those protocols firmly in place and ensuring that we're screening folks. We're keeping up those social distancing, the hygiene, and we're managing the quarantine and contact tracing if we do pick up a case. Rob, do you want to add any further color to that?
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom. And I'll just add a couple things, Tom, to your question, Tyler. I think the other thing that we've been doing throughout is just had very regular communication with respective authorities in the government. And that's included quite a number of site visits. So they've seen the standards at which we're adhering to. And in many cases when people are not on site, it's actually better than being in the community. So just having that confidence in what we're doing at site and continuing to do that is really important. And I think the other couple of things just to build on the very practical things that Tom outlined is that, we did change rosters before to have our sites with longer rosters. And that makes sure there's less turnover during these times and that obviously helps. And also just minimizing anything that visits and minimizing the number of people that we've got on our sites. So after the last three, four months, I think we've come up with a number of very successful tactics. But as Tom said, the chronic unease is very much the year and we're not dropping around this at all.
Tyler Langton: Great. That that's helpful. And just two, I think quick financial questions. With the Gold Corp. synergies, I think the target was 340 million this year. And then a total of 500 million next year. Is there sort of any change to those numbers? And then just with capital allocation, I know sort of the longer term plan is to kind of invest roughly half the free cash flow into the business and then the other half towards sort of dividends repurchases. Just with the dividends and repurchases, is there any sort of updated thoughts there? Or is it something where you're still sort of waiting to see just how the impacts of COVID play up?
Rob Atkinson: Thanks. Tyler, I'll pick up your synergy question and ask Nancy Beuse to pick up the capital allocation question. On the on the synergies, those numbers -- so the $340 million of cash flow this year and the $500 million of cash flow next year, which exceeds our initial commitment of $365 million from that transaction. Those commitments are built into our guidance and we are delivering on those. And a lot of the value for this year has come from three areas, the G&A savings, so they bundle up exploration G&A. There's upwards of $150 million there. This supply chain improvements. And then there's the big value drivers Peñasquito, and Peñasquito is performing very well either side of the -- what was the shortest shutdown period for care and maintenance and it ramped up very quickly, so Peñasquito performing synergies are delivered. Nancy, do you want to pick up the capital allocation.
Nancy Buese: Sure. So really on the capital allocation, we just recently raised our dividend very significantly. And so, our view is while there's still some uncertainty around COVID, and just understanding the full ramifications of that on our operations, we feel like that dividend is very solid for now. And we will continue to consider what we should do with the dividend level going forward. And our capital allocation you have a just right, as we've indicated before, as approximately over the cycle 50% of that back to the business and 50% of that back to shareholders. We think we're at the top of the cycle, but it's really hard to say right now. But our view would be, we'll continue to evaluate that and continue to look at dividend levels as we put the backdrop of our business plan for next year in place and really understand the balance sheet ramifications.
Tyler Langton: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom. Take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes, thank you. Tom or perhaps Nancy, do you have any idea what the ongoing COVID related costs will be? Either in millions of dollars or per ounce?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I'll pick that one up. Greg, Nancy may want to build upon it. But it's roughly $4 million to $5 million a month, which is around the $7 to $9 per ounce, which is around the things were put in place around hygiene, around different, different transport that you need to maintain social distancing and the like. So that's the cost you seen and the costs you could expect to have ongoing as we continue to have those protocols in place. It doesn't include. It's a bit harder then to measure the productivity impacts of needing to clean out a vehicle between -- as you do also change. As you have different ways for running pre-staff meetings and all of those productivity impacts that you have that are over and above. Maybe you get some tailwinds, and we'll get smarter at doing that. But a rough rule of thumb is that $4 million to $5 million a month, the additional cost for those measures. Nancy, would you like to add anything to that?
Nancy Buese: Yes. I think that's right. So that that translates to about $3 an ounce. And the other piece of that is other community funds that we may spend. But just as a reminder, those are adjusted out of AISC and adjusted EBITDA and A&I, but will certainly continue to impact free cash flow. So again, it's not huge dollars in the overall scheme of things, but we would anticipate incurring those on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.
Greg Barnes: Okay. Thank you. And just the second question. Tom, given the environment we're in and the another free cash flow you're generating. Are you doing any early work or contemplating about how you could actually increase your production profile?
Tom Palmer: Greg, no. What we're looking at all those key projects that are in late stage definitive feasibility studies. So it's a half a north and Yanacocha sulphides. So they're both late stage and definitive feasibility, full funds, next year they do sizable projects. And they will have a contribution to that production profile with the ebbs and flows over that 10 years. That's where our focus is. And that will be significant drawers on free cash flow in the next year. And then the other thing you got to balance out with that is that they'll have three significant projects in Tanami 2, the Ahafo North Yanacocha sulphides, all happening in parallel, and it's about balancing that with you around your project execution risk. We will continue to invest in those studies that are further up the pipeline. But we won't unnaturally move them forward. They need to go through the proper -- they are big projects and they need to go through the proper rigor and process, and we'll continue to spend on exploration efforts as well. So nothing significant. But we'll continue to navigate our project pipeline through its natural course.
Greg Barnes: Okay. Thank you.
Rob Atkinson: Another way of looking at it is a current process that as we continue to work our margins applying full potential, it means more margin.
Greg Barnes: Thank you.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks very much. I guess, first, I'll ask Nancy, maybe circling back on the capital allocation and dividend questions. Given where we are with gold prices today, have you thought about maybe the difference between increasing the regular dividend versus maybe just topping up with the one-time or special dividend in light of maybe the peak gold prices were add? Is that something that you guys would think about doing?
Nancy Buese: Yes. We'd look at all those different options. And I think as we've talked before, there's a host of tools in our toolbox ready for use. So we do prefer to consider how our regular dividend travels against the cycle. But I would say at this point in time, we're just in the middle of putting together our 2021 business plan. And so our view would be is let's continue that work. See how the next five years stacked up, and then we'll be in a really good position to test various tools against that backdrop and see where we are as we continue the journey of capital allocation. As a reminder, we just increased our dividend. So we feel like that's a very good level throughout the cycle and certainly understanding that we are generating more cash at this time. We will as always continue to evaluate the right way to return that cash to shareholders.
Jackie Przybylowski: That's fair enough. If I can also ask on the full potential program. I know, last couple of months have been very difficult. But are you able to give us a bit of an update in terms of how it's going at Peñasquito. And are you -- I know you mentioned that you've realized quite a bit of synergies. But are you realizing the benefits from the full potential program that you were expecting?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jackie, I'll might ask Rob to give you some color on full potential which is going very well, but if you can fill in some details.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Jackie. And the simple answer is, very much so that Tom mentioned and he is pretty humble about the rates that we were able to achieve after we came back from the care and maintenance. And really within just a handful of days, we were back up to the record levels that we were reaching before. So going through the middle, we were well above 110,000 tons a day. And that just shows the amount of effort, the stability and the focus that the team has got there. We're also making big improvements in the mine in terms of the way in which we're digging the ore to make sure there's no dilution and just the accuracy of what's going through the plant there as well. And really across the board of Peñasquito, so Jackie as you know, there's opportunity everywhere in terms of the way in which we're utilizing our equipment, the effectiveness of our drill and blast, the quality of the blasting in our supply chain, working on the air availability of our equipment. The effectiveness of our maintainers, et cetera, on all those counts, we're seeing improvement. And I think the longer that we continue to run, the more records that we're going to break there. And also, Jackie, it's been very positive.
Jackie Przybylowski: Great. That's great to hear. Thanks very much, Rob. And that's it for me. Thanks.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Jackie. Take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide just a bit more color on some of the geotechnical issues at Éléonore. I know you touched on it during the prepared remarks. And maybe just talking about some of the options that you're looking at to lower the cost there? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad. I want to pick that one up with that little bit of color and get Rob to provide some more details. But Éléonore is a similar story to the one we had at Leeville in Nevada back in '15, and '16, where to really get an understanding of a complex geotechnical ore body, you need to take your models to an order of magnitude more detail. And once you've got that level of understanding and that model, you're bringing the geological model and you can better map out your mind plans and then your appropriate mining methods for that ore body. That's the work that we've been doing over the last several months. And actually using some of the same people, Dave Thornton, Kate Williams, who did that work very successfully, and led that work very successfully at Leeville in Carlin, back in '15, and '16. And now Leeville is a very important part of the Carlin underground complex that Nevada gold mines and largely because of that excellent work that they did. So that's the work that we're now applying to Éléonore. Knowledge and skills we're applying to Éléonore. And I might get Rob to give you some more specifics about the Éléonore mine and that issue.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom, and thanks for the question. And just reinforce what Tom said is that, as a miner, the two key things that you look for an underground miners is a geological model that you could confidence in and a geotechnical model you've got confidence in. And we've arrived at that position. And I think, when you kind of look back to what we reported earlier in the year, but the reserves and the resources that --we have got lot to do in terms of the stope design, in terms of our dilution and recovery. And those are the key things that we continue to work on at Éléonore. And really is the basics of mining is, how do you make sure that you're putting in place stopes in the right sequence and the right size, that you're not bringing on new forces of geotech which caused disruption moving forward. When you stand back in terms of the cost. As I spoke about before, we are resetting Éléonore to an operation around that 250,000 ounces moving forward. And we have to reset the costs around that. And obviously, save the people numbers and as an example of that, pre-COVID, that Éléonore with about 1200 employees and contractors, that certainly got to get down to more like the 900 people level. We've also recognized our full potential area that the highest cost activities in our development, and we know that we've got to increase and improve the development rates that we're achieving there. And certainly the team is very focused on that. Similarly, with all of our heavy equipment, we had too much gear at Éléonore. And we've basically stripped the heavy equipment out to really be focusing on the amount of equipment that you need to run a mine of that size. And whether that trucks, that's the loaders, that's the bolters. So we are now approaching the right amount of equipment. Now, obviously, that needs less operators, it needs less maintenance as well, and it flows into the costs. But the key thing which would emphasize it really is around that, managing that dilution and the recovery. And that's where the team is very much focused on. The other key point that we do have coming very much into our favor is the commissioning of the Lower Mine handling system there. That is essentially in essence removes the need to truck up an 500 meters. So it's going to provide quite a big productivity kick there. But I hope that provides you with some detail in terms of what we're doing at Éléonore. And last, but by no means least, we've got the team in place, and we've got the focus there, which will really drive that harder than ever before. So we're plan to put the helps ahead.
Fahad Tariq: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Fahad.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Hi, Tom, Nancy and, Rob, hope you're going well. I just had a few shorter questions, hopefully. Firstly, just on Musselwhite. Just wanted a little bit more clarity on the exact timing? I think there's just been a little bit of confusion over the exact quarter when we should expect production? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Chris. I'll get Rob to pick that one up.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Chris. Musselwhite is going very well, that we're expecting the conveyor system to be up and running coming into the year. So it is the fourth quarter. And in December is the current timeframe that we're looking at. And just to give you a sense that, in terms of the progress there that we've got two key conveyors there that were doing conveyor frames on one of the two kilometer stretches. We've got all the hanging supports and the other. So really the critical path is around the fire suppression and then actually pulling and placing the bales. But at the end of the year is what we're very much focused on and it's progressing well, Chris.
Chris Terry: Thanks Rob. And then, just in terms of the use of capital, I guess, the CapEx, minor changes in 2020 versus 2021. And then also just thinking about the Greenfields exploration as you'd pull back previously. So is the increase, it's all just COVID related. There's no kind of fundamental changes in thinking of allocation or anything on that side. You would expect that you'll ramp up greenfield activities as you get better access to sites in simple terms?
Tom Palmer: That's right, Chris. So you'd expect to see our exploration go back to the similar spend as we guided to this year, once we've got access to those locations. And then, I think with the -- if I've understood your question correctly with development capital, you'll see, since we're focused on the critical path at Tanami 2, you'll see some of that spend would have been this year following into next year. So you'll see a bit high development capital in 2021 as a consequence of that sustaining capital will stay pretty stable. We don't see any bow wave in the sustaining capital.
Chris Terry: Okay. And two other quick ones. So the autonomous work that you've done, can you just give an update on where in terms of Boddington and just if you've done any more work on other sites, or if there's any updates for the autonomous positioning within the broader business?
Tom Palmer: So autonomous, we're really focused on Boddington at this point in time. And that's all progressing very nicely. Those trucks will start to arrive in a not too distant future. Coming out of the factory in few area and a nice Caterpillar AHS test facility being commissioned in the next few weeks just up the road from Boddington, so we're very well positioned to have a good Caterpillar dealer support. For other operations, where we do look to start -- if you want to take as I did many years ago with AHS and Pilbara, you build your pilot site within the business. You prove up what it can do. And then you look at how can be modeled across the rest of the business. So that's step one strategically and we probably eyeing off those big projects at [Indiscernible] North Abeta Neterion Galore Creek as to how autonomous haulage could help those projects, improve the economics of those projects as we optimize them at the PFS stage. And then look to see within the application in their existing other operating. But that's the strategic approach with AHS be on Boddington at this point in time.
Chris Terry: Thanks, Tom. I guess the last one for me, you talked a lot about COVID impacts. But maybe I'll ask you in different ways. There's one site or maybe two sites that you'd still most concerned about, is being the most vulnerable. I assume it's South America. But would you able to give color on a particular side as it Peñasquito, Yanacocha? What keeps you up at night as the key risk from the COVID side?
Tom Palmer: Yes. It would -- it's the countries that and how those countries are managing the pandemic are the ones that concern me. I'm very confident about our ability to manage the risk of the spread of the infection at any one of our operations. The protocols are the same everywhere. My worry is more around the community spread and then the governments. They need to take action. And Mexico and Peru would be those two countries that we watch carefully. But nothing, nothing in terms of what's happening outside. It's more about how those countries are managing the health crisis.
Chris Terry: Thanks Tom. That's it for me. All the best.
Tom Palmer: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Hi, yes. Good morning, everybody. Rob. I just wanted to circle back on Éléonore again, so that I understand it correctly. I think, originally when we you took over the gold portfolio, I think Éléonore was viewed as a mine that would be looking somewhere in the sort of the 325,000 ounce range or there about. The change to 250 now, as you've reset it, is it is it a combination that -- and again, I may be missed this. Is your views on the reserve or is it -- there's more dilution to this overall plan or less hoping that you have to do on an annual basis, because of the pressures that you have to open it up for. Just trying to understand what change have you seen now? And the second part is, do you expect to get the synergies that you had originally anticipated from this asset?
Tom Palmer: Tanya, thank you. And just to touch base on your question. I hope, I can go down the right road for you. But essentially, over the last year that we've had the asset, just doing more geotechnical investigation through our experience, and more geological modeling, including structural geology, our understanding is so much greater. So when we've been able to see what we've got in practice with also the modeling. That's been the biggest change, and we've been able to adapt and refine. So it's really been around the mining practices, which are being put in place to the way in which the ore presents, and the condition which the ore is under. That's essentially what we're dealing with. And so it's certainly not, because the material is not there. It's how we're actually mining it. And I think that's the key thing, which I'd certainly say, Tanya. And that's why I still remain very, very focused on the opportunity at Éléonore. We are still doing, exploring both downward to see if the ore body continues plus out on both sides, as well as the full potential projects. And, again, none of the full potential projects are rocket science. It truly is the basics. And I think that as we get Éléonore for purpose, at its fighting weights around 250, we're going to see in all those synergies continue. And I think it's important to say that, the lenghts of the support for Éléonore is now already coming from Denver. The supply chain it is now coming from Denver. The G&A is being supported from Vancouver, as well as Denver. So we're already seeing the softer synergies here. But in the mine itself, it really is focusing on the basics and making sure that we're mining back ore body the way it should be mined.
Rob Atkinson: Tanya, maybe just one that -- their overall synergies tenure I think Éléonore was $25 million.
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes. Okay. Maybe we'll take this offline to get more into the technical details. Maybe one for Nancy if I could. Nancy, what -- as you look at your balance sheet, and you look at that free cash flow that is being generated. And you did say, half of it back into the business and half back to shareholders. Can you just remind me, what's the minimum cash balance that you like to keep on the balance sheet to run your business?
Nancy Buese: Yes. We've talked about them in the past tenure. We certainly don't have hard and fast around that. I would say, generally, we keep in mind the fact that in certain countries we do need to keep certain balances, or we have tax leakage coming back to the U.S. So it's a very complex network of where we're going to spend capital and where we're generating free cash flow. I would say, generally speaking, that number for us is around $2 billion. But it certainly does matter to us where that cash is available for different purposes. So yes, I would sort of say in that $2 billion range, sometimes higher if we're getting ready to enter a period of capital development, capital work, but that's probably the minimum at the lower end of the cycle.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, great. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Graf of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Adam Graf: Thank you. Good morning, Tom, Rob and Nancy. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the slides, I was struck by the big impact on GAAP earnings from the change in value from your equity portfolio. And I was curious if maybe you could discuss the process and the speed that you guys are going through those interests and how you're sorting through them and deciding what to get rid of and when?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. All might pick that one up and get Nancy to pick up some of that question as well. We're continuing to look at cleaning up that equity portfolio. We talked about the group of equities that we've didn't see fitted with our portfolio going forward and looking at ways that we could potentially package them up and sell them. So that work is continuing. And obviously in the current price stock, we want to make sure we get full fair value for those as well. So we're not basing to do anything there. We are still testing the market with those. We don't have this contingent fit. We've also seen some of the swings that roundabouts, which Nancy might touch upon it. You saw that value come off and that value in the first quarter and then that value came back up again as markets recovered. So you may be seeing some of that flow through with those equities as gold price moved around with the pandemic. Nancy, is there anything you'd add to Adam's question.
Nancy Buese: Yes. I would just say that, our unrealized holding gain losses on that portfolio was about $227 million or $0.28. And then the other piece of that is there was a tax benefit recognized resulting from those changes. So that's really the impact of that portfolio and it's really just relative to I'm sure valuation around current gold prices.
Adam Graf: Sure. Maybe just to change the subject. Could you guys -- do you have a schedule or an idea of when you guys might be able to give us some more details regarding CapEx and grades and sort of a summarized mine plan for the Yanacocha Sulphide project?
Tom Palmer: Adam, it's probably going to be in the next year as we work through our affinitive feasibility study work and get closer to that full funds approval or potentially as we issue well. If we get some more colors we issue our guidance again later this year. So we'd look for a milestone like that or closer to full funds to provide an update. I mean, that information we're sharing now from memory came with last year's guidance issue in December. So that's typically when we -- as we revisit our plan, and update numbers and update out guidance that would have been the logical place to might give you some more color on that project. 
Adam Graf: All right. Thank you. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks a lot, guys.
Tom Palmer: Right. Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen and Nancy.
Tom Palmer: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Dudas: Tom, maybe one just you could share your thoughts on -- it's been the one year anniversary for the joint venture in Nevada. Your perspective from when it -- when you engage to where you are today and how you see it from Newmont standpoint?
Tom Palmer: From my perspective, Mike, it was a joint venture that should have been done a long time ago. And I'm pleased that we're able to get it done first quarter of last year and bring those two assets together. You had a Newmont and you had in Barrick mature assets that were both starting to enter into the twilight stages of the life and declining production profiles. And I think the ability to bring those ore bodies and those processing plants together brings life into those assets for both organizations and for those communities through Northern Nevada. So I think it was a very good transaction that is creating value for both Newmont and Barrick shareholders and the whole is definitely worth more than the some of the individual parts. So I think it was continues for me to be a very good transaction. And quite frankly, I think it's a transaction that should have been done some time ago. And I think too many egos caught in the way on both the Newmont side and the Barrick side. And I'm pleased, its done.
Michael Dudas: I think everybody agrees with that. How about relative to production costs, the expectations that Barrick have put through relative to what you envisioned. Is that you feel that's on the right track and maybe this could continue to the upside because of some of the power, those synergies that you have said?
Tom Palmer: Certainly, we -- as the junior partner in the JV, we are looking to see the synergies realized. And we continue to provide support and influence to see the value from those synergies coming through. There is a very straightforward synergies and then there's some that are harder to get as you start to optimize mine plans around that double refractory. So we're keen to see those flow through. And we continue to influence and supporting seeing those flow through. The team also have had to manage through the COVID pandemic, as we all have, and I think Greg Walker and the team have done a show in terms of navigating through the pandemic, and managing all the impacts that come from that, that impact on both the production cost performance. So continue to work with Barrick as the operator and keen to see those synergies flow through.
Michael Dudas: That's all for me. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for any closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: And I'm please, as we continue to manage the impacts of this nasty virus. Please you and your families stay in keep safe and well. And we look forward to talking to you in the not too distant future. Thank you everybody.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont’s first quarter 2020 earnings call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont’s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at Newmont.com.  Now I’ll turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Jess. Good morning and thank you all for joining our call. Newmont’s core values of safety, sustainability, integrity, inclusion and responsibility are fundamental to creating long-term value for our investors, host governments, communities and employees. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining is more relevant today than ever before.  Turning to Slide 4 for a review of how we’ve been responding to these unprecedented times from a position of strength, the health and safety of our people and our host communities is paramount in every decision we make. This is why Newmont moved early and quickly, proactively taking steps to prevent transmission of the coronavirus. By taking an informed approach with the advice of the World Health Organization, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and external medical professionals, we fully mobilized our rapid response across management teams in early March and implemented our business continuity plans across the globe.  We’ve implemented wide ranging controls at all of our operations, putting the health, safety and wellbeing of Newmont’s people and communities above all else. These controls include but are not limited to cancelling all non-essential travel, closing our offices and implementing remote work arrangements in early March, significantly reducing the number of people working at our operating sites to just the essential number of people required to operate and maintain the mines, processing plants and environmental control systems, enhancing temperature and questionnaire screening at entry points to our sites, implementing strict social distancing protocols in planes, buses, light vehicles, offices, and dining facilities, developed leadership continuity plans for key roles across the business, increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitization of surfaces, providing hygiene and health support to nearby communities where employees and contractors live and work, and proactively ramping down certain operations to reduce the risk of transmission to nearby communities with limited healthcare capacity. We established a global supply chain task force to assess potential risks and develop viable contingency plans that allow us to stay ahead of any potential disruptions. Importantly, we have not experienced any material issues with our supply chain and continue to benefit from our strong relationships and transparent engagement with our suppliers. Across our sites, we have increased inventory of key supplies to pragmatic levels, ranging from three to six months where possible, and we remain diligent on monitoring critical watch list items. To date, Newmont has no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at any of its sites thanks to the discipline of our workforce in adhering to these protocols. I am incredibly proud of the way our employees have responded to these challenging times. In addition to their strict adherence to our protocols, they have further demonstrated their commitment by joining the fight against this pandemic in the communities where they live and work. We not only want to protect our people and host communities, we want to build lasting resiliency so that our host communities can thrive after the worst of this pandemic passes. As a global business with operations in eight countries, we are committed to doing our part to combat this disease and protect our people and their livelihoods. The strength of our business and maintaining robust relationships not only allows us to endure short term disruptions but allows us to reach beyond our sites to create value and improve lives for all of our stakeholders. Associated with this commitment, we have made two important decisions. First, we have committed to maintain pay for all of our employees through until at least the end of June to support them and their families and remove short term uncertainty. Second, we established a $20 million global community support fund to help host communities, governments and employees. The Newmont Global Community Support Fund builds upon our other local contributions and efforts we have made over the last two months.  With input from local stakeholders, we have identified three focus areas to ensure that our financial support will have the most positive impact and reach those who need it most. These three focus areas are: employee and community health, food security, and local economic resilience. We will closely monitor the progress and outcomes of our support so that we are able to fine tune and improve results along the way with a view to serving as a catalyst to long term resiliency and future community development. Turning to Slide 5 for a framework on how we are preparing for multiple scenarios, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, our deep bench of experienced leaders and proven operating model continue to serve as a competitive advantage. We are proactively planning for and evaluating short, medium and long term risk through a comprehensive framework that involves the following actions: mapping the virus in each of our countries in order to be prepared for a safe and efficient return to more normal operations. For 2020, we’re assuming the greatest impact to operations and financial performance could occur during the second quarter; however, we’re also planning for other scenarios where we could see a resurgence of the virus later in 2020 and early ’21. Finally, we’re evaluating a lower likelihood scenario where there is a recurring seasonal impact from the virus. We are currently in wave one, and while there is an increasing likelihood for a wave two, we remain optimistic the worst of the pandemic will have passed in the coming weeks after worldwide efforts to contain or suppress the spread of the virus begin to take hold. We are ramping up operations at Cerro Negro, Eleonore and Yanacocha, which Rob will discuss further, and assuming Penasquito is able ramp up in the coming weeks, our 2020 gold production will be towards the lower end of our previous guidance, or approximately 6 million attributable gold ounces, whilst costs are tracking towards the higher end of the guidance range. In terms of our capital spend, we are still progressing the majority of our development of sustaining capital projects with our key projects progressing on schedule. These key projects include Tanami Expansion 2, the development of sub-level shrinkage mining method at Subika Underground, and a lay back for Boddington and Ahafo. However, our capital overall is trending lower than our original guidance as we have reduced non-essential activities and spending in areas where we were significantly ahead of schedule. For exploration, approximately 80% of our budget is allocated to near mine activity and a lot of that work is continuing; however, we have put our greenfield exploration on hold as a feasibility study work continues to advance remotely for both Yanacocha sulfides and Ahafo North. We will provide further clarity on our 2020 outlook when Penasquito begins to ramp up; however, it’s worth noting that our guidance for 2021 through 2024 still stands. Despite the disruption from COVID-19, we are well positioned to withstand this pandemic and, most importantly, Newmont’s long term value proposition remains unchanged. Turning to a look at our global diverse portfolio on Slide 6, within our portfolio of 12 operating mines and two joint ventures, we have an unmatched eight world-class assets, each of which delivers more than 500,000 ounces of consolidated production per year and all-in sustaining costs of less than $900 per gold equivalent ounce and a mine life that exceeds 10 years. Importantly, particularly in the current context, all are located in top tier jurisdictions that we define as countries classified in the A and B rating ranges by each of Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch.  In addition to our eight existing world-class assets, Newmont has two emerging world-class assets in Yanacocha and Merian. These emerging assets within our portfolio offer substantial upside through further optimization and development over the coming years.  Turning to Slide 7 for a look at our production for the next decade, our stable production profile will generate more than 6 million ounces of gold per year for the next 10 years, underpinned by world class assets and further supported by an industry-leading exploration program and organic project pipeline. This profile is further enhanced with over $1.5 billion per year in additional revenue from producing between 1.2 million to 1.4 million gold equivalent ounces from co-products with silver, lead and zinc from Penasquito, and copper from Boddington. Combined, we will deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year, the most of any company in our industry. Turning to our free cash flow generation potential on Slide 8, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the gold price cycle. For every $100 increase in gold price above our base assumption, Newmont delivers approximately $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Using our conservative $1,200 gold price planning assumption, our free cash flow would still total more than $5 billion over the next five years and at current gold prices our portfolio will generate around $15 billion of free cash flow over the same five-year time frame. In addition, we have the potential for further upside with tailwinds from favorable oil prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The excess free cash we generate will be used to reduce our net debt and provide additional returns to shareholders. Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue executing our capital priorities and staying focused on creating long term value. Turning to Slide 9 for a review of our performance against our promises, simply put, Newmont is delivering on its commitments. With world-class assets in top tier jurisdictions, the gold industry’s best production profile of more than 6 million gold ounces per year for the next decade, and the industry’s largest gold reserve base of 96 million ounces, we are firmly positioned for long term success. In a little over a year since acquiring Goldcorp, we have already realized significant value. We originally committed to delivering $365 million per year in synergies by the end of 2021 but are now on track to realize $500 million of cash flow improvements in 2021, an increase of nearly 40%. We’re accelerating G&A and exploration synergies along with higher than planned full potential improvements. It’s worth noting that these cash flow improvements do not include our share of synergies from the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture.  We have received $1.4 billion in total cash proceeds from divestments, meeting our target of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Our commitment to leading shareholder returns remains stronger than ever as we returned our first quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. Turning to Slide 10 for a look at our first quarter highlights, the strength of both our strategy and operating model is shown through our solid first quarter performance despite the impacts and disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter we produced nearly 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,030 per ounce, and we also produced 339,000 gold equivalent ounces from co-products. We generated operating cash flow of $935 million and free cash flow of $611 million, and we continued to progress our full potential program across our portfolio with a particular focus on the more than $240 million in value we have identified at Penasquito, Cerro Negro, and our mines in Canada.  During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet, receiving $1.4 billion in proceeds after completing the sale of KCGM, Continental Gold, and Red Lake. We refinanced approximately $1 billion of debt through the issuance of new senior notes at historically low coupon of 2.25%, and we lowered our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.7 times.  Newmont has one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with $3.7 billion of cash and total liquidity of $6.6 billion. In April, our board approved a 79% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share from $0.14 per share. Newmont’s first quarter dividend will provide investors with the highest dividend yield of any senior gold miner and is a testament to our financial flexibility, balance sheet strength, and conviction in the stability of our business. We also continued to execute our buyback program during the first quarter, buying back approximately $300 million worth of shares. In total, we have now retired $800 million or nearly 19 million shares at an average price of just over $42 per share since initiating this program only five months ago, an excellent outcome. With that, I’ll turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob on Slide 11 to review our operational performance.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 12 for a summary of our operations, the strength of our diversified global portfolio in top tier locations along with our operating model and capable workforce is a key differentiator for Newmont during this unprecedented time. As of today, 10 of 12 operating mines and both of our joint ventures are operating. These operations represents approximately 90% of our planned 2020 gold production, and the U.S., Australia, Ghana, Suriname, Dominican Republic, Ontario, and Argentina have all deemed mining an essential activity. While we have significantly reduced the number of people working on our sites by approximately 50%, which is equivalent to more than 10,000 employees and contractors, our overall productivity remains high and our workforce is very focused on safely delivering to our plans. We have stopped all non-essential work, our processing plants are being run near 100%, and underground development is progressing mostly to plan. Moving to even time rosters means there is more downtime at the start and end of shifts, but given the longer rosters now being worked, we can recoup most of this gap. We are no longer hot-seating equipment and are making sure to spend the time needed to sanitize all interpersonal [indiscernible] sites; however, we consider any time required for these activities as a simply must-do investment to protect the health and the safety of our workforce.  In mid-March, we proactively placed four operations in care and maintenance in order to protect the health of our workforce, neighboring communities, and to comply with government mandated restrictions. Three of these sites - Yanacocha, Cerro Negro and Eleonore, have since resumed operations.  Yanacocha safely ramped down on March 17 in response to travel restrictions. Limited personnel remained on site to perform essential work, including security, water treatment, environmental protection, and gold production continued from leach pads. We are remobilizing and plan to restart the mill and surface mine operations in the near future, given that as part of the Peru Economic Reactivation Plan, the president has decreed that surface mines will be allowed to start.  At Cerro Negro, operations were also placed on care and maintenance on March 23 due to travel restrictions. Essential personnel remained on site to maintain infrastructure, continue environmental management, provide security, and continue ground control activities. We are executing our safe restart plan, including remobilizing our workforce, and the site is on track to having a significant proportion of operations working again this week.  At Eleonore, we ramped down activities on March 23 to comply with the Quebec government’s restriction on non-essential travel within the province in order to mitigate the risk of transmission to northern and remote First Nations communities. Following the directive given by the Quebec government on April 13, mining activities are no longer restricted. We have been working closely with the Cree First Nation Grand Council and the Cree Health Board to determine an acceptable path forward that protects our employees and communities, as we take the risk of transmission from the virus from other Canadian [indiscernible] communities very seriously. Just last week, we agreed to a path forward and have begun ramping up operations at Eleonore.  At Musselwhite, we proactively moved to care and maintenance on March 23 in order to minimize fly-in/fly-out activity to prevent the possible transmission of the virus into communities, including nearby First Nations communities in northern Ontario. We are developing plans to safely and efficiently resume operations.  In aggregate for the first quarter, we incurred approximately $27 million of care and maintenance costs from these four operations which are not adjusted out of our results or unit costs. Across our entire portfolio, we also incurred approximately $2 million of COVID-19 specific costs related to items like health screenings, travel arrangements, and storage costs.  Subsequently on April 12, Penasquito moved into care and maintenance and we have continued to engage with government authorities at all levels to ensure they understand Newmont’s industry-leading response to COVID-19 globally and our belief that the mine can operate safely during this time. Once we are able to resume operations, the site is well positioned to ramp back up quickly and efficiently over a two-week period. As Tom mentioned, we look forward to providing further clarification on our 2020 outlook as we get this operation back up and running. Of the sites in care and maintenance, our overall spend is approximately 50% of our normal CAS with approximately 30% coming from our important decision to continue to pay employees through June and the remaining 20% for the traditional care and maintenance activities, such as environmental management and security costs. This investment helps to ensure we are very well positioned to ramp up safely and efficiently with the full support of our workforce and the local communities. Turning now to Slide 13 for an update on Australia’s performance, at Tanami I am very proud of our team for quickly adapting to the unique requirements of a fly-in/fly-out operation. Their adherence to protocols while altering transportation schedules and shift changes is commendable. In addition, the willingness and dedication from our workforce to relocate to Darwin in the Northern Territory from other parts of Australia has allowed us to mitigate the risk of interstate border closures and continue operating.  At site, we achieved solid performance during the first quarter as an increase in ore tons mined helped to offset lower grade from mine sequencing, and we have improved load and haul productivity by establishing underground waste dumps to reduce haulage to surface and increase mining rates.  Across Newmont, we are very committed to continually improve our safety performance and utilize technology where it makes sense to do so. One great example is the industry-leading robotic technology for diamond re-drilling we are deploying at Tanami which removes our employees from the line of fire when drilling and removes the fatality risk associated with equipment entanglement. During 2020, we will integrate five robotic rigs to the fleet and will replicate this impressive technology at other Newmont underground sites globally. Looking ahead, I’m really excited about the progress the team is making at the Tanami Expansion 2 project, which is progressing well as we begin ramping up mine development. Our team advanced 560 meters in February and March, well exceeding planned rigs. In March, we finished the top section of the pilot hole, breaking through to the mid-shaft chamber at 655 meters, and the team are now working to establish a raised bore rig underground in preparation for drilling the bottom section of the pilot hole down to 1,460 meters. We continue to award long lead procurement packages and decided to use Australian steel for construction of the crusher and head frame to avoid any potential delays from the delivery of Chinese-sourced products during this period of uncertainty. At Boddington, our three-year stripping campaign in the south pit is progressing well and we expect to reach higher grade late this year and continuing through 2021. We approved the autonomous haulage system in February and our investment of $150 million began in April with an order for 29 new CAT 1793 haul trucks, along with plans to retrofit seven existing CAT 793Fs. This investment in technology will enhance safety and improve productivity to generate significant value over a 14-year reserve life.  Lastly, in January we completed the sale of our 50% ownership interests in KCGM for cash proceeds of $800 million, and we continue to advance the sale of our power business.  Turning to Africa on Slide 14, after delivering a record 2019, we clearly communicated that the region would have lower production levels in 2020 as we continue to invest in the future of our world-class Ahafo operation. Both of our Ghanaian mines continue to operate and our team responded quickly to ensure we have preventative controls in place for COVID-19 while progressing critical path items.  At Akyem, solid throughput and mill recoveries helped to offset lower grades due to sequencing during the first quarter. The site continues to drive improvements at both the mine and mill, and our team is leveraging the strength of our integrated operating model by working closely with our processing and asset management operation support hubs in pair.  At Ahafo, we continue to progress stripping at the Awonsu and Subika open pits while advancing underground development for the updated mining method at Subika Underground. Our transition to a more productive underground mining method at Subika Underground remains very much on track and we anticipate ramping up our ore tons mined in the second half of this year. In fact, our year-to-date development rate average has been about 35 meters per day. At Ahafo North, our project work is advancing remotely with a full funds decision still expected in 2021.  Now to our North America operations on Slide 15. In the first quarter, we continued to advance critical path work and our full potential improvement program which will allow us to maximize value from these assets and step up our performance over time. For example, at Penasquito our focus on the basics and rolling out full potential had the site breaking records for tonnage through the augmented feed circuit within just a few months. The site also achieved its highest ever production of silver, zinc and lead during the month of March and achieved record gold recovery from the pyrite leach plant.  For those of you who had the opportunity to attend our site tour in February, I trust that our progress towards improving value at this world-class polymetallic operation was evident, and I remain very excited about the opportunity to eliminate constraints, reduce costs, and increase productivity, ultimately allowing us to extend mine life through resource conversion.  Another significant milestone we recently achieved was to finalize a definitive agreement to resolve all outstanding disputes with the community San Juan de Cedros, one of 25 neighboring communities near the mine in the State of Zacatecas. This agreement was signed with community-elected representatives and will be ratified in a general assembly that will take place when COVID-19 gathering restrictions are lifted by the government. The agreement was developed and supported through the dialog table sponsored by Mexico’s Federal Department of the Interior and representatives of the state government of Zacatecas. Together with the water plan signed in December 2019, we are pleased and excited to bring months of negotiation with the Cedros community to a close and really look forward to sustainably operating in this region for decades to come. The definitive agreement also sets forth terms for the Penasquito mine to occupy more than 10,000 hectares of the Cedros Adheridos land for exploration, mineral production, and other operational purposes, and resolves all outstanding disputes between the two parties. This world-class asset already has reserves of approximately 26 million gold equivalent ounces, but the significant exploration potential in this prospective district will allow us to extend value delivery for decades to come. We are very pleased with the outcome of the agreement and believe it is the best path forward for both parties to develop a long-term partnership to create value and improve lives, shifting the dynamic from confrontation to cooperation.  Lastly, in response to placing the site on care and maintenance on April 12, we are working with the government to determine a timeframe for ramp-up of operations. The Zacatecas region has one of the lowest rates of cases of COVID-19 and we believe our workforce can be kept safe by limiting personnel on site and enhancing safety and health protocols around social distancing and hygiene.  Turning to Canada, at Eleonore we’d previously communicated that we would step down gold production, driven by mine sequence changes and our ongoing efforts to integrate our geology and geotechnical models to optimize a life of plan to extend mine life. With the site previously in care maintenance, the team took the opportunity to proactively refresh their roster schedule to be more efficient while also progressing full potential remotely as we move into the deliver phase and leverage our experience from other underground operations.  The team has also spent time prioritizing the full potential initiatives that will be implemented as we restart, including an asset management improvement plan. With a new general manager in place, we are strongly focused on the day-to-day basics to ensure a strong foundation is in place as we start ramping the operation back up.  At Musselwhite, our team was exceeding their commitments and the conveyer installation was approximately 65% complete and well ahead of schedule before we placed the site in care and maintenance in late March. We now have every part for the conveyer installation in Thunder Bay, and installation of the conveyer will be the first thing to ramp up after a decision is made to resume operations. The Musselwhite materials handling project is 95% complete and will be ready for a full system test once the conveyer is installed.  Full potential is progressing virtually with a focus on improvements in underground development productivity, enhanced chucking performance and technical updates to ore body modeling, and the site is ready to come back stronger than ever. In fact, we currently have four to five stopes open, and prior to moving to care and maintenance we safely and successfully restarted the mill after nearly 10 months down and produced well ahead of plan approximately 15,000 ounces in the first quarter. Overall, we remain well positioned to ramp back up safely and efficiently once we have support from our neighboring First Nations communities. Should this occur over the next several weeks, we still anticipate being back to full production in early quarter four. North Porcupine and CC&V continue without interruption, and finally, we completed the sale of Red Lake to Evolution Mining for $375 million and future contingent payments of up to an additional $100 million tied to new resource discoveries.  Rounding out the regions is South America on Slide 16. At Merian, we delivered strong first quarter performance with higher ore tons mined as the site continues to benefit from productivity gains. In March, Merian’s processing team achieved 22 consecutive shifts without downtime, smashing their previous record of 14 shifts, an example of ongoing operational excellence despite challenging times. Yanacocha production increased during first quarter as our real leeching program successfully delivered higher ounces, and while the site was in care and maintenance, we continued to recover ounces from the leach pad. At Cerro Negro, mine sequencing impacted grades in the first quarter but we made solid progress to improve operational standards and apply back-to-basics mining practices, which includes improving development, ground control and backfill practices.  Our work to develop out to Amelia [ph] was also progressing well prior to the site ramping down and we still expect to reach this new mining area later in 2020; however, we expect 2020 production and costs to be impacted due to the COVID-related shutdown and as we continue to improve operational standards.  Looking forward, study and engineering work continues to advance remotely for Yanacocha sulphides and we remain on track for a full funds decision in 2021. Finally, an important milestone was passed recently and I’m very proud of the project team, who just surpassed one million safe hours worked in March. With that, I’ll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17.
Nancy Buese: Thanks Rob. Turning to Slide 18 for the financial highlights, during the first quarter Newmont delivered solid results with revenue of nearly $2.6 billion, an increase of 43% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from our acquired operations and higher gold prices, adjusted net income of $326 million or $0.40 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of more than $1.1 billion, an increase of 63% from the prior year quarter. Cash from continuing operations was $939 million, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow was $611 million, an increase of 75% to end the quarter with more than $3.7 billion of cash on hand.  Turning to Slide 19 for a review of earnings per share in more detail, first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $837 million or $1.04 per share. Adjustments included $0.73 related to the gain from our sale of KCGM, Continental and Red Lake, $0.22 related to the change in fair value and impairment of investments, $0.09 related to the extinguishment of debt, $0.24 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance, and $0.02 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.40 per diluted share. Turning to Slide 20, as Tom mentioned, Newmont continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic from a position of strength, and there’s been no change in our industry-leading capital allocation priorities which include maintaining and strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet, growing our margins through delivery of our full potential program which drives incremental cost and efficiency improvements regardless of current gold prices while also growing our reserves and resources through disciplined investment in our highest returning projects, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with total liquidity of $6.6 billion, including $3.7 billion of cash on hand and our undrawn and fully available $3 billion revolving credit facility. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 0.7 times, and we proactively refinanced $1 billion of debt at historically low coupon of 2.25%, allowing us to save approximately $17 million in annual interest payments and also improving the profile of our out year maturities. We have continued to invest in profitable projects such as the Tanami Expansion 2 and Musselwhite materials handling, and as Rob mentioned, our study work to progress the next wave of profitable production at Ahapo North and Yanacocha sulphides is advancing.  Newmont remains committed to sustainable shareholder returns across the cycle, and we continued to demonstrate this in the first quarter. Two weeks ago we declared a first quarter dividend increase of 79% to $0.25 per share, and we continued to execute on our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately $300 million during the first quarter. Since initiating the program in early December, we have completed 80% of our $1 billion authorization with nearly 19 million shares retired at an average price of $42 per share. With our shares currently trading around $60, our buyback program has been incredibly accretive to shareholders. As a reminder, we build our annual business plan based on conservative assumptions, including a $1,200 gold price, and for every $100 in gold price above our base plan, we’ll generate an incremental $400 million in attributable free cash flow annually. With gold prices currently around $1,700 per ounce and favorable oil prices and foreign exchange rates, these tailwinds will more than offset any short term disruptions as we manage through these challenging times. With that, I’ll hand it over to Tom to wrap up on Slide 21.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Nancy. Concluding on Slide 22, Newmont has a long and proud history of safety leadership, ESG stewardship, developing the industry’s best talent, and focusing on operating discipline and profitable growth. From this foundation we remain focused on improving our ability to deliver differentiated, superior and sustainable shareholder returns. We will do this by developing our people, optimizing our assets, delivering our best projects, exploring our most prospective properties, and strengthening our balance sheet. I’m very excited to continue strengthening our position as the world’s leading gold company with a workforce and culture of determination that are second to none. Thank you for your time. With that, I’ll turn it over to the Operator to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Tyler Langton of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Tyler Langton: Good morning Tom, Rob and Nancy. Thanks for taking the questions. Hope you’re all doing well.  I think you mentioned, Tom, that mines representing 90% of plan production were operating. I was just wondering, are those operating at full rates or are there any sort of limitations on them from COVID? Then with costs, I think you mentioned that the cap costs would be at the higher end. Can I get a sense of what you’re also assuming for currency and oil and if there’s a benefit there?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tyler. Please stay with us, Tyler, and the other people who ask questions - we’re all located at different locations around the globe on our telephones at our homes, so hopefully technology bears with us. I hope everyone on the call and your families are all safe and healthy. Tyler, probably the operations that we’re ramping up in Cerro Negro and Eleonore, and to a lesser extent Yanacocha, there will be a fairly slow ramp-up at Eleonore and Cerro Negro as we work our way through the logistics of moving people around Argentina to get them to work, so we want to work with our employees and work with the various stakeholders at a national, provincial and local township level to make sure we can move people through the country, through the provinces to get them to work, so ramp up will be a little bit slower at Cerro Negro as a consequence.  Similar at Eleonore, we held back when the Quebec government lifted their restrictions because we wanted to have the full engagement of the First Nations, the Cree, and we’ve been working with them to work through the protocols we had for operating. Again, we want to work with them and slowly bring people back and demonstrate to them that we can safely manage the risk of spread of infection around those communities.  At Yanacocha with the decree from the Peruvian government the last couple days, it will allow us to ramp back up both milling and mining operations, so that will move out of care and maintenance pretty smartly. The rest of our operations around the globe, as Rob indicated in his remarks, are largely operating as expected. We are seeing delays at shift change, we are seeing delays associated with hot seat changes where you can’t do that--you need to clean down vehicles before another person gets on. But a number of locations, we’ve extended our shift roster through this time, so you win back some of that efficiency through those longer roster times.  What I might do is ask Rob to talk to some of the costs, the question you asked, and I’ll get Nancy to talk to some of the tailwinds and when and how we might see that coming through. Just in terms of our broader costs, we are tracking to the higher end of our guidance. We’re really wanting to see--as we indicated in our remarks, we’re wanting to see Penasquito come back out of care and maintenance. We’re cautiously optimistic on that front. We’ve got some very good engagement going on with the Mexican government. We have presented our plan for how we would operate Penasquito and manage the risk of infection. We’ve based that plan on what I consider the benchmark of the mining industry globally, the work the Australian government and the Australian mining industry has done, so we have leveraged that work. Those discussions have gone very well. We’ve also got great support from the U.S. government and the U.S. embassy in those discussions with the Mexican government.  We’re cautiously optimistic. We want to see through and out the other side of a decision being made to come out of care and maintenance, and then we’d be in a position to provide some update on our guidance, both production and unit cost. Rob, is there anything you’d add in terms of Tyler’s question around costs?
Rob Atkinson: Thanks Tom. I’d just add a couple of things. Tyler, I think just working from the basics, what we’ve clearly outlined is that when we’re in care and maintenance, that’s typically 20% of our CAS. Because of the decision that we made to provide continuity and pay, that takes it up to 50% even when you’re in care and maintenance, so that’s the kind of base point. Now as Tom mentioned, at the likes of Eleonore, at the likes of Cerro Negro that we’re progressively building up, so you can expect to see that to go from 50 to 60 to 75 over the coming weeks, so that’s roughly the way in which I would approach it.
Tom Palmer: And Nancy, do you want to cover some of those tailwinds on foreign exchange and oil?
Nancy Buese: Yes, thanks Tom. Morning Tyler. We do publish an annual sensitivity guidance, and just a couple notes on that. We had budgeted oil at $60 a barrel and our sensitivity is for every $10 change in the price of a barrel of oil, it’s a $25 million increase in attributable free cash flow, so you can do some of the math on that.  We monetize on the Aussie dollar. We budgeted a $0.75 rate. If a nickel change in the Aussie dollar rate, that’s $40 million of additional attributable free cash flow, so there certainly will be some tailwinds associated with WTI and with FX as we think about where we might land versus plan. 
Tyler Langton: That’s helpful. Just a final question on capital allocation, I guess you ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and have completed 80% of the buyback. Obviously I understand that COVID creates some uncertainty, but can you just share some thoughts around capital allocation going forward with buybacks and the dividend?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tom. Nancy, you want to pick that one up as well?
Nancy Buese: Yes. I think the important point on our discipline around capital allocation certainly has not changed. We’ve been very clear about sharing with shareholders and also reinvesting back in our business, and we will continue to favor those principles. When you think about the dividend, that increase was predicated, as we announced earlier this year, on an oil price--sorry, on a gold price of $1,200, and so we still maintain that at $1,200 that dividend is certainly affordable.  On the share buyback, our view is that we had the billion-dollar program, we’re about 80% into that. We were able to get almost all those shares well under $45, and so our view is we’ll continue to keep that program outstanding and we’ll continue to think about what we will do, but if you consider how our capital allocation will be, it will be about half back in the business and then the other half we’ll continue to focus on balance sheet, dividend and share buyback, so all of those tools are still in the toolbox and up for consideration. 
Tyler Langton: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Hi Tom, Rob and Nancy. I hope you’re all faring well. I had a couple of questions. Firstly on the free cash flow, just thinking about that the next couple of quarters, with the operations you have offline, I just wondered where there’s working capital implications from, I guess, overstocking some of the raw materials on site, which is obviously sensible, and just some of the moving parts on the cost side. Just wondered if you can comment, maybe Nancy, on free cash flow expectations or some of the moving parts for 2Q and maybe 3Q. Thanks.
Nancy Buese: Sure, I’d be happy to take that one. I really don’t think we’ll see much, no real significant changes. You might see later on in the year, there will be some tax payments in Q2, but fundamentally in order to get what we need at site, it’s not going to be a materially significant change on working capital numbers.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks. Then just another one, maybe again for you, Nancy, just in terms of the capex. I think it was mentioned earlier in the call it’s likely to be lower this year. Do we just think of that as staying the same amount out for 2024, so whatever you don’t spend in 2020, you would spend in latter years?
Nancy Buese: Yes, I think what you’ll see is just as a result of some of these sites being in care and maintenance, you’ll see some of that capex roll from 2020 into ’21, and likewise out the backside of ’21, so some of that will get pushed over time. I wouldn’t anticipate a big, quote-unquote, catch-up if you will in the plan period as we’ve announced.
Chris Terry: Thanks Nancy. Just a last one from me on Musselwhite, it the decision there on the delayed start-up, is it purely based on COVID or have you taken the time right now while it’s offline to do further work on materials handling, etc., and there’s an advantage to spending the time while it’s offline getting that all right, and then bringing it back online? Just wondered if you could clarify some of your thinking there.
Tom Palmer: Yes, thanks Chris. The decision to put Musselwhite into care and maintenance was made on the basis of the engagement we had with the local communities, the local First Nation communities in around that mine, and their very serious concerns around the vulnerability of those communities to the spread of infection, particularly when you have a workforce that heads up into northern Ontario from southern Ontario and further afield. So engaging with that community and addressing their concerns, we made proactively the decision to put that operation into care and maintenance, and that includes the team we had constructing that conveying system. There’s a small team on site who are basically keeping equipment turning over so it’s ready to restart again and managing environmental control systems, and we continue to engage very closely with those communities, as we’re doing in other parts of the world, to demonstrate the protocols we have in place that are working very effectively around the world, and we remain hopeful that as we can demonstrate our ability to manage the risk of infection that we can start that operation back up again and get the construction of the conveyer completed, but just concerning that we have stopped all work at Musselwhite, including the conveyer construction.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks Tom. Actually, just one other one, or maybe two small parts, but just to clarify on the 90% of production that’s currently running, do we just adjust on a GEO basis--obviously with Penasquito offline, just adjust directly for Penasquito to think about it on a percentage of GEOs online? Is that the right way to think about that? 
Tom Palmer: We’re just looking at each other on whether it’s Nancy or Jess. Do you want to pick up that one, or we can take it offline with you, Chris, and give you some direction on that.
Chris Terry: Okay, actually one other one, just reading on Suriname a little bit, just wondered if you could comment a little bit on the repatriation, some of the currency constraints within that country. Does that impact anything at all? Thanks. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris. I’ll get Nancy, probably best to comment on that one.
Nancy Buese: Yes, absolutely Chris, and on your other question - sorry, I was pausing for a moment, keeping myself up quickly enough, but the question on that was, it is not GEOs, it’s really gold only. On the Suriname question, no, we do not have concerns there. We have a ratified investment agreement that covers this particular issue, so we are not concerned about the currency controls there.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks everyone. Appreciate it.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris, take care.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes, thank you. On the definitive agreement that you’ve concluded with the Cedros community, are there financial terms in that deal that you need to address?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Greg. Rob, did you want to pick that one up, or we do have Steve Gottesfeld on the line, who could pick that up as well. Might one of you answer Greg’s question?
Rob Atkinson: Okay, so I may just kick off and then ask Steve to pick it up. Hi Greg. There most definitely is financial implications to the agreement. Certainly that’s been a large part of the negotiations. As you’ll remember, the negotiation involved land rental, it involved water, it involved compensation, it involved infrastructure improvements, and as well as employment, work opportunities, etc., so there was a variety of things.  But what I’d certainly say before Steve comes in is that we are very, very pleased with those outcomes and certainly we believe that it’s very fair, very reasonable, and it gives us that certainty moving forward. Steve, do you want to add to that?
Steve Gottesfeld: Sure, thanks Rob. The only thing I would add really is that it is all within our budgeted plan, so where we ended up landing is consistent with where we had expected to go, and so while there is a water component to this which is a longer term commitment, which was also part of the plan, the other amounts really have all come in line, so no impact on anything to do with guidance or anything like that based on these agreements.
Greg Barnes: That’s great, that’s very helpful. On the capex--
Tom Palmer: Greg, the numbers are relatively low--sorry, Greg. The numbers are relatively low. It’s not hundreds of millions of dollars. It’s a few million dollars.
Greg Barnes: Okay, good. That’s great. On the capex, it was low in the quarter relative to the old guidance. Does that reflect just delays in spending at some of the operations that were shut down, or is that a conscious effort to bring capex down for this year?
Tom Palmer: It’s mainly COVID-related, Greg. You are seeing COVID-related delays, and it’s largely linked to where we have made a deliberate decision to move non-essential people, or only keep on site people who are essential to keeping mines, processing plants and environmental control systems running. Where we were well ahead on sustaining capital spend, we’ve made a decision to slow that down and actually move people offsite and delay some of that spend, and protect against the risk of infection spreading.  Similarly with some of the development capital projects like Tanami 2, we focused on what the critical path was in that project and then dropping off some work in areas, for example we were building a new camp out where the underground mine is. We’ve slide that work down because it’s not on the critical path. Sustaining capital this year is probably tracking to around the $900 million mark, development capital around the $500 million mark, so some of those rates you’re seeing now will probably hold through the year. We’re probably looking capital somewhere around $1.4 billion across both sustaining and development capital.
Greg Barnes: Great, thanks Tom. That’s helpful. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. Rob, maybe for yourself and for Tom, I’m just looking out - you know, you gave us some amount for the impact of COVID on your cost structure in Q1, but as we go through this COVID and let’s say everything sort of normalizes to the new norm, are we going to be taking additional costs through the cost structure for COVID, either all of this social distancing that’s impacting us through additional costs and/or productivity?
Tom Palmer: Tanya, I’ll kick off and I might get Rob to comment, and Nancy might even want to chip in with a few comments as well. I think we’re in a new normal. I think for many, many months we’re going to be managing social distancing and we’re going to be managing screening at our sites, so as I think about moving people around a site on buses, I think about staff meetings, I think about dining facilities, I think about office cleaning, I think about plane flights, think about the people you have doing temperature screening at the entry point to sites, I think we’re going to be--I think that’s going to be with us and with the mining industry for a long time to come, so some of those costs that you’re seeing, we’ll get more efficient with those costs, but I think some of those costs that we’re seeing, you’ll see part of our cost base going forward. In the overall scheme of things, they’re not huge, but they will be part of the cost going forward.  Nancy or Rob, do you want to chip in?
Rob Atkinson: I’ll kick off, Tom. Hi there, Tanya. I think what COVID-19 has also done for us, it’s also sharpening our focus. We already had a very keen eye on productivity before this, but what we have found is that because we’ve stood down about 50% of people at our sites, those non-essential personnel, it really allows us to take the opportunity to say are they actually needed back on site or should they be based in regions, should they work from home, or ultimately should they still be working for us at all. It does give us the opportunity to really think about how the business is running and what we can do. I think similar to doing the earnings call this way today, it’s also allowing us to think about the travel that we’ve been doing in the past and the way in which we’ve been communicating, the face-to-face meetings, etc. There’s a whole host of improvements, I think, that we can make as a result of this. Just to echo what Tom said, we are into the new normal, that certainly we have got additional costs, but I’m very hopeful that given the creative minds that we’ve got, given the use of technology, given the way in which we plan, that we may in fact see in some areas a significant increase in productivity rather than a reduction. Nancy, do you want to add anything?
Nancy Buese: I think that’s exactly right. It’s a great time for us to really evaluate our processes and consider how we think about productivity across the globe. I would note that we will be adjusting out any specific COVID-related costs, and some of those care and maintenance costs for us in particular as a U.S. GAAP filer compared to other miners is going to be a little bit less, so the rules around the U.S. adjustments will be smaller than you’ll see in other places. But we will capture those and indicate those in our filings, so there’s the two pieces of it, is the actual costs related to COVID, but I think Rob makes the point it’s just a really good opportunity for us to take a new glance at everything and really think about our productivity at all sites and everywhere across the globe. We’ll keep on that path.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Maybe Rob, when you were reviewing some of the assets and some of your development work that you are doing, and you had said at several sites it was ahead of schedule, it appears that in some areas, your productivity is still quite high, it has not been impacted. Is that a fair statement?
Rob Atkinson: That’s correct, Tanya. We’ve got some areas which are progressing very well, and if I pick on a few that--you know, at Subika Underground with sub-level shrinkage, the advance rates there; at Tanami and even at Musselwhite before we stopped there, we were making terrific progress on the conveyer belt. At Penasquito, one of the unfortunate things post the visit, we’d broken a whole host of records for the site as well, so in general we’ve been very, very pleased about how things have been operating. But the likes of Boddington, Akyem, Ahafo, Tanami, CC&V, Porcupine, they are all still producing very well and very nicely, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, that’s good to hear. Thank you very much and good luck, everyone.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Tanya, stay safe.
Operator: Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question will come from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Thank you, good morning guys. I just had a question on Penasquito. Could you--I’m assuming that one continues to remain shut down at this point, and I apologize - I jumped on late. Could you give us an idea of how you view that re-ramp going over the next couple of quarters?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Anita, it’s Tom here. Again, I’ll start off and get Rob to chip in as well. I think on Penasquito, if I’ve understood your question correctly, it still is in care and maintenance, ramped down mid-April. We are cautiously optimistic. We’ve had some very good engagement with the government and good support from the U.S. government, U.S. embassy in helping us engage with the government, and we’ve also presented, in fact a couple of times, in fact more than a couple of times now with multiple iterations our plan for a re-start. We have been able to draw upon the protocols we have in place elsewhere, which are working very, very effectively, to demonstrate to the Mexican government that we can safely ramp up Penasquito, particularly given its location, remote location in a province that has a very low rate of the virus and a mine site, as you know, that’s remote with its own airstrip and self contained accommodation.  So we remain cautiously optimistic that through the course of this month that we will start to get some approvals to re-start, but we want to see that happen before we take a step and start to update guidance and the like. We continue to engage with the government, answer the questions that they have of us, and cautiously optimistic that it can ramp up in the near future. If we do get that green light, it’s only a week or two to get Penasquito back up and running, and then it’s back to where we were through the first quarter. Rob, is there anything you’d add to that?
Rob Atkinson: I think just a couple of other backgrounds things, Tom. Certainly whilst we are lobbying very hard, the 18th of May is the date that we are very much focused on, and that’s what the government has said, that industries who can demonstrate they’ve put COVID controls in place can start.  Just to add to what Tom said, currently in Mazapil there have been zero COVID cases, and that’s obviously where the mine is at, so that all helps. Again, we’re cautiously optimistic, we’re working hard, the site’s in great condition, and when we do and are able to ramp up, it will be straight to phase six in the pit hopefully, where there is higher grade and get back on track as quickly as possible.
Anita Soni: Thank you, that’s it for my questions.
Tom Palmer: Right, thanks Anita. Take care.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jackie Przybylowski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jackie Przybylowski: Thanks very much. Just want to follow up a little bit more on Anita’s last question. Under the impression that the Mexican government has approved restarting mines just generally May 30, so is that the case where if you were able to demonstrate the safe ability to restart, you may be able to restart earlier, but the worst case scenario would be May 30, or do you envision there’s potential that you could be closed longer than that if they don’t decide in your favor?
Tom Palmer: Jackie, I think there’s a couple of aspects to answering this question. One is the Mexican government, as many governments are, and Mexico in particular is I think the virus hit Mexico a bit later than some other countries, so the Mexican government is still grappling with how they manage the spread of this virus, so as they work through that, those circumstances for them more broadly move and change. What we’re working with on the basis is that our plans we have presented to the Mexican government are robust, they’re very pleased with those. We operate in a location in Mexico that is remote and we can manage our protocols very well, and they’ve indicated to us that we’d be part of the pool of companies that they’d be looking at for some approvals around May 18. But I don’t want to get in front of the government. Engagement is good, there are good plans in place, but I want to see that approval come through and then we can go forward and provide some direction about Penasquito. We continue to support the government and wait for them to go through their process and give us their approval, so we’re cautiously optimistic but don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.  Rob, would you add anything to that?
Rob Atkinson: I think, Jackie, the only other additional one I would say is that since the order from the government came out, we’ve been working with the government from day one, and I think as Tom said, every single day we’ve been working with them, we’ve presented our case, so we think we have got a very strong position. But you know, May 18 is what the government has indicated, but as Tom rightly said, that could change. But that’s what we’re focused on at the moment and given that our processes and our procedures are of a very, very high order, we remain quite hopeful. But we’ve had a tremendous amount of lobbying, this is not a last minute case at all, and we’ve been with the government and supporting the government and the community every step of the way, so we’re known about, we’re understood, and very hopeful we can be one of the first to lead the way and show the Mexican mining industry how to best do it.
Jackie Przybylowski: Got it, thanks. Maybe just a second question, if you wouldn’t mind maybe giving us an update on what you’re thinking on capital allocation. I know you’ve just recently raised the dividend. With strong gold prices, can you maybe just give us an update on what your thinking is in terms of dividend, buyback, and other capital allocation decisions you’re making? Thanks. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks Jackie. I’ll ask Nancy. Nancy, I’ll just you a warning now to get off mute, Nancy, and I’ll ask you to answer the question. She’s had a few technical challenges.
Nancy Buese: Yes, I’m failing at the bingo game this morning. Thanks very much. Jackie, really our commitment to disciplined capital allocation has not changed. The way we’re thinking about it is continuing to consider about half of the free cash flow invested back in the business in terms of the long term side of things from a project and advanced work in exploration and some of those pieces, and then the other piece is really returning cash to shareholders.  As a reminder, with our five-year guidance and now even the 10-year guidance that we’ve given, we’re really thinking about our contributions and our cash flow through the cycle with crisis both high and low, so you’ll see us continue to invest in the business on the one side and on the other side of the ledger, you’ll see us continue to do the work that we’ve demonstrated around improving the balance sheet, really working on our out year debt towers and improving those rates, and improving the way that looks over time.  We’ll do exactly what we’ve done on the share buyback, which was incredibly accretive to shareholders, and then the other piece of that was really what we’ve done with the dividend, and so as we are in this period of time where we’re generating significant free cash flow, those principles around capital allocation have not changed and we’ll continue to adhere to those and consider ways to provide value back to shareholders, but also maintain that investment in our business, so that discipline really hasn’t changed in any way.
Jackie Przybylowski: Great, thanks very much. 
Tom Palmer: Thanks Jackie, take care.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian MacArthur of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Brian MacArthur: Good morning. I want to follow up a little bit on Tanya’s question. Can you remind me where we are on getting autonomous haulage working at Boddington? The second part, I guess, is just in this COVID-19 world and looking at longer term cost structures, does this all accelerate moving autonomous haulage to some of the other mines? Obviously there’d be a distancing advantage there, and potentially a cost savings.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Brian. I’ll kick off and then pass to Rob. I think it’s more than just autonomous haulage, I think it’s the use of technology and automation, whether it be open pit or underground. I think there is certainly an opportunity that we’re seeing where we’re implementing technology now that has more of a distance case for implementing technology and allowing more work to be done with automated equipment, but the other thing we’re seeing is the investment we made in technology to be able to work remotely is working very effectively.  As Rob talked about, the ability to have less people on operating site but still be able to work very effectively supporting an operating site out of regional location or a central location, like Denver, is working very, very well, but also just how many people do you actually need to run our business sustainably. I think in this new normal that we’re going to have going forward, the technology beyond automation is giving us many opportunities, and we’re actually seeing how it can work very effectively. So as we talk about the three scenarios that we’re looking at and we’re modeling, we are actively talking about how do we re-shape this business in the context of having impacts from this pandemic that are going to live with us for many months, many years ahead.  In terms of your specific question around automation and autonomous haulage at Boddington, Rob, did you want to pick that one up?
Rob Atkinson: I certainly will, Tom, and thanks for the question, Brian. It’s moving at pace. We have ordered the 29 793s, so that well and truly in the CAT system and we’ll start seeing those arrive later on in the year. We continue to be very excited about what that’s going to be like, but that’s and well truly on track. As you rightly said, it not only improves safety, it can improve productivity very significantly, and that’s what the team is very much focused on, as how do we improve the productivity with these trucks. I think just to build on a couple of other things that Tom said, in terms of our automation plans, the sub-level shrinkage in Africa, one of the key reasons for changing to that was the ability to potentially automate that in the future. Our relationships with the likes of CAT and the introduction of Minestar, the autonomous drills that we’ve got at Penasquito, so we’ve got the hardware but it’s also the data, and what you do with that data is just so important.  One of the key differentiators, I think, with Newmont is the operating support hubs that we’ve got in Perth and we’ve got in Denver, where you actually monitor the maintenance performance of all your equipment and also your mill performance, and you’re able to give that feedback real time, so in many ways it’s not just automation, which I think people think more and more about, it’s also the way in which you use data and place people, where you put your expertise, and giving that real, live feedback to our personnel out in the field. But the good news is the autonomous trucks at Boddington are very much on track.
Brian MacArthur: Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Brian, take care.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for any closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you everyone for joining us today on this call. Thank you for your interest in Newmont, and most importantly please take care of your safety, your health, and please look after your families. Look forward to speaking to you in the not-too-distant future. Thank you everyone.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's full year and fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Jess. Good morning and thank you all for joining our call. Newmont has a track record of superior operating and financial performance and we are continuing to build on this proven record like seeding the commitments we made early last year. As we enter our centenary year, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to safely deliver superior value for all of our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. In 2019, we continue to lead in environmental, social and governance stewardship by achieving our public targets and being recognized as the gold industry leader for our performance. Last year, we completed two historic transactions, creating the most balanced portfolio of long-life assets with the ability to generate robust free cash flow for decades to come. We produced 6.9 million gold equivalent ounces, including 6.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $966 an ounce in line with our full year guidance. We generated $3.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and realized significant value from the Goldcorp acquisition exceeding our targets. We also reported the largest reserves in company history with an industry leading 100 million ounces of gold reserves. We drove improvement across our portfolio and have now delivered $2.7 billion in value through our full potential program since 2013. We also delivered four projects on four continents on time and within budget and approved full funds for our next expansion at Tanami. We reached agreement to divest Red Lake, KCGM and our holdings in Continental to generate more than $1.4 billion in cash proceeds and we returned an unprecedented $1.4 billion to shareholders last year with $900 million in dividends and $500 million in share buybacks. This is unmatched in the gold industry. Our 2019 performance is evidence that we continue to deliver on our commitments. Turning to Slide 5. We are making excellent progress and exceeding our commitments the value delivery from our five new operations. At the start of last year, we made a commitment to deliver $365 million of run rate improvements per annum by the end of 2021. I'm very pleased that we are on track to exceed that commitment by nearly 40%, realizing more than $500 million of cash flow improvements in 2021 through accelerating G&A and exploration synergies along with higher than planned full potential improvements at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro. This year alone, we expect to achieve $340 million in cash flow improvements representing over 90% of the commitment we made for value delivery from this transaction. Each of our accomplishments was grounded in the safety of our people and the sustainability of our operations. Turning to Slide 6, improving safety remains our relentless focus for all of us here at Newmont, ensuring that everyone working in our business can return home safely to their family and friends is paramount. Through our visible caring leadership and the integrated systems we put into place to manage risk consistently across our global operations, we are working to significantly and sustainably improve our safety performance. My expectation is that everyone who works in our business understands first and foremost the fatality risks associated with their work and are ensuring that the critical controls that are required to manage them are in place at all times. A robust safety culture is one that is constantly reinforcing systems, behaviors and actively sharing lessons learned from serious incidents. This is fundamental to the wellbeing of our people and underpins our operating performance. Now sustainability performance is also about consistent application of sound governance practices across our global business coupled with the quality of our engagement and the relationships with key stakeholders. As a measure of our industry leading performance, we were honored to be recognized as the top gold mining company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year in a row. Turning to look at our global portfolio on Slide 7. Our world-class assets are located in the most balanced and favorable jurisdictions. We have the industry's largest gold reserves at 100 million ounces with nearly 90% located in the Americas and Australia. This offers Newmont shareholders exposure to 124 gold reserve ounces per 1,000 shares. Our reserve base also provides significant exposure to copper, silver, zinc and lead representing an additional 63 million gold equivalent ounces. Across our 12 operated mines and two non-operated joint ventures, we have an average reserve life greater than 10 years with mine lives at our largest assets, Boddington, Tanami, Peñasquito, and Ahafo extending well into the 2030s underpinning the strongest and most sustainable portfolio in the industry. Turning to Slide 8. We will produce a steady 6.2 million to 6.7 million ounces of gold per year through 2024. In addition, we will generate $1.5 billion in revenue each year from producing between 1.2 million to 1.4 million gold equivalent ounces with silver, zinc and lead from Peñasquito and copper from Boddington. Combined we deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year, the most of any company in our industry. Turning to Slide 9. Even during a year involving the closing of two historic transactions, our full potential program remained as strong as ever delivering $430 million of value in 2019. Looking forward, all-in sustaining costs are expected to improve from $975 an ounce in 2020 to $850 an ounce in 2023 through the delivery of our full potential program and ongoing investment in profitable projects. Over this time, we will maintain our capital discipline through investing approximately $1 billion of sustaining capital per year to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. With that I will turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, on Slide 10 to review our operational performance.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Tom, and I'll start with an update on Australia's performance on Slide 11. In 2019, Australia produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $908 per ounce. At Tanami, we delivered a record year for production and costs with 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of less than $725 per ounce. Through our full potential program, we delivered significant value from improvements at the pace plant and with greater pace fill reliability, the site can continue to sustainably increase mine productivity. Successful delivery of the first Tanami expansion project in 2017 and the Tanami power project in early 2019 have enabled this performance and established a foundation for us to continue expanding this terrific asset. Our next phase of investment in Tanami expansion 2 has a potential to extend the life beyond 2040. We'll reduce operating costs by over 10% and will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. At Boddington, we produced approximately 850,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2019 as full potential programs in mining and processing led to improvements in truck and shovel productivity as well as increased gold recovery. Our planned stripping campaign in the South Pit is progressing very well. In fact, full potential improvements to truck and shovel productivities have accelerated the time when we will reach higher grades to earlier in 2021. And at KCGM, we completed the sale of our 50% ownership in early January. We are supporting Northern Star and Saracen by providing transitional services through the second quarter. The Australia region has consistently exceeded conversion targets by more than offsetting depletion. During 2019, Tanami added 1.5 million ounces of gold reserves, and over the last seven years, reserves have grown by more than 250% and resources have also increased by nearly 200%. Lastly, Boddington's Autonomous Haulage system was approved by our board of directors earlier this week, and this world-class asset is positioned to realize improved productivity and significant value over a 14 year reserve life. Turning to a bit more detail in Boddington's Autonomous Haulage system on Slide 12. Over the last several years, Boddington has delivered a step change improvement in operational performance, which has increased mine and mill productivities, added 4.2 million ounces of gold reserves and extended mine life well into the 2030s. These successes have now positioned the operation to make its next step change improvement, the full automation of its haulage fleet. Boddington will invest $150 million to purchase 29 new CAT 793 haul trucks. It will retrofit seven existing trucks at the site and install the Caterpillar command autonomous haulage system. This investment will enhance safety by removing people from the line of fire and reduce the potential for vehicle to vehicle interactions. These systems will also improve productivity and create a more controlled, predictable and efficient haulage operation and ultimately lowering Boddington's mining cost per ton generating an internal rate of return of more than 35%. With the improved costs, mine life is extended by at least two years from additional laybacks in the North Pit. The support we will receive from CAT will be essential to the success of this work and we have a very strong working relationship with them, which has been formed over many years. And we're also uniquely positioned to support effective implementation and operation of the fleet. Thanks to the technical capabilities and previous experience of leaders throughout our business. The adoption of autonomous haulage has true replication potential and will inform our approach to implementing these systems at other Newmont operations and projects. Now to our Africa operations on Slide 13. 2019 was a record year for the Africa region with 1.1 million ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining costs of less than $800 per ounce on the back of successfully completing Ahafo’s expansion projects. We declared commercial production at the Ahafo mill expansion, which will maximize value from higher grade underground ore efficiently process ore from existing open pits and stockpiles allowing us to deliver stable production well beyond 2030.  Our team delivered yet another solid quarter and offset lower grade as the site team worked closely with the process control team at our operations support hub in Perth to drive sustainable Sag mill throughput improvements.  This is just one example of how Newmont is leveraging its global capability to consistently drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects. Looking forward as previously highlighted in our guidance, the region will step down to 850,000 ounces in 2020 as Ahafo progresses it's stripping campaign for Phase 4 at Subika open pit and advances underground development for the updated mining method at Subika Underground. With the transition to a more productive underground mining method, Ahafo has increased its reserve and resource base collectively adding 1 million ounces in 2019. Now to discuss our North America operations on Slide 14, North America produced more than 1 million ounces of gold in 2019 with a strong fourth quarter as expected. At Porcupine we successfully ramped up the Borden underground mine providing additional higher grade ore. At CC&V we recovered ounces from the VLF1 leach pad that had been deferred from prior quarters. And at Éléonore we delivered a strong fourth quarter with higher grades at Horizon 5 but expect to softer Q1 as a result of mine sequence changes. Éléonore is a complex ore body when taking into account stope sequencing, backfill requirements and grade presentation. Our technical services and exploration teams are strongly supporting the operation to integrate our geology and geotechnical models to optimize a life of mine plan that will safely and sustainably mine our reserves and extend the life of this ore body. At Musselwhite rehabilitation work is nearing completion and our contractor segmentation is progressing well with the construction and installation of the conveyor. We are on track to have the conveying system fully commissioned and the mine back at full production by the start of October at the latest. Over the last six months we've been mining ore and building a stockpile ready to feed the mill. This stockpile currently contains approximately 50,000 ounces of gold. Commissioning of the mill is progressing very well and in fact we just processed first ore from our stockpiles through the mill this week. At Peñasquito, our work to sustainably improve the cost base offers the potential to build upon an already exceptional reserve and resource base similar to what we have achieved at Boddington. In 2019, we declared gold equivalent reserves of more than 24 million ounces underpinning a current reserve life of 12 years. And operationally we delivered a strong finish to the year which we expect to continue into 2020 as we reach higher grades in the main Peñasco pit. Turning to Slide 15 for more detail, in 2019 we delivered more than $50 million in cash flow improvements from quick win initiatives at Peñasquito exceeding our market commitment for full potential delivery at that operation. When we launched full potential at site, our team quickly identified that the crushing circuit at the front end of the mill, what we call the augmented feed circuit, was the key bottleneck in the processing plant. And that working this bottleneck to sustainably increase throughput and improve the quality of crust ore provided to the Sag mills would lift the overall performance of the processing plant. Early quick wins in the augmented feed circuit, came at the secondary crusher and high pressure grinding rollers where we replicated our success at Boddington and did a direct lift and shift of control logic to immediately improve the quality and quantity of feed. Taken together these initiatives delivered record crushing throughput and record metal production for silver, zinc and lead in November. In 2020, we will continue to work this bottleneck hard and for those coming to Peñasquito next week, I'm very much looking forward to taking you through more detail on this and other important work we are doing to deliver more than $100 million of further costs and productivity improvements at Peñasquito by 2021. Rounding out the regions with South America, on Slide 16, South America produced nearly 1.3 million ounces of gold and delivered all-in sustaining costs of approximately $815 per ounce in 2019. At Merian, we delivered better than expected fourth quarter performance and I've transitioned into mining harder ore at the Merian 2 pit. Fresh rock will present higher grade and improve mine productivity which helps offset reduced mill throughput rates. Yanacocha continues stripping the Quecher Main pit as we move out of higher grade ore in the Tapado Oeste pit and we are now placing Quecher Main ore on the new Carachugo leach pad and we expect to see recovery of these ounces during 2020. At Cerro Negro, we mined higher grades as expected from Eureka and Mariana Norte and work to develop out to Emilia is progressing well as production begins to ramp-up from this new mining area later in 2020. And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 18, for the financial highlights. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter and 2019 results. During the fourth quarter, Newmont delivered revenue of nearly $3 billion, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from our new operations and higher gold prices. Adjusted net income of $410 million or $0.50 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion, an increase of 70% from the prior year quarter. Cash from continuing operations was $1.2 billion driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow of over $775 million, an increase of more than $300 million from the prior year quarter. With a solid finish to the year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $1.4 billion or $1.92 per share of which we paid an annual dividend of $0.56 per share. We also paid out an additional $470 million in 2019 in the form of a special dividend. Finally, in association with the $1 billion share buyback we announced in December, 2019 we have already repurchased $500 million worth of shares. Turning to Slide 19, for a review of earnings per share in more detail, fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $537 million or $0.66 per share. Adjustments included $0.11 related to the change in fair value of investments, $0.10 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.05 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we’ve reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $0.50 cents per diluted share. Turning to Slide 20. At Newmont, we build our annual business plan based on conservative assumptions including a $1,200 gold price and a disciplined approach through which mine plans are developed based on reserves and the best demonstrated performance of plants and equipment. Our base plan at $1,200 gold price allows us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet with a focus on our maturity profile to maintain our infrastructure and invest in mine development through a steady $1 billion of sustaining capital. We continue investing in organic growth, including approximately $600 million to $700 million of development, capital expenditures and another $250 million of exploration and $150 million of advanced project investment per annum and return cash to shareholders through an industry leading annual dividend. In January, we announced a plan to increase our annual dividend by 79% to $1 per share reflecting the confidence we have in our business to deliver substantial cash flows well into the future. The increased dividend will be effective upon approval and declaration of our first quarter 2020 dividend in April. Turning to Slide 21. We expect to generate significant free cash flow through this cycle. At current gold prices, our portfolio will generate more than $10 billion of free cash flow over the next five years and even using our more conservative $1,200 gold price space free cash flow would still total $5 billion over that same period. As shown on this slide, for every $100 per ounce increase in gold prices above our base assumption, we'll deliver approximately $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Excess free cash will be used towards debt reduction and further shareholder returns. Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue a trajectory of industry leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value creation. And now I'll hand it over to Tom to wrap up on Slide 22.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Nancy. Turning to Slide 23, we continue to build momentum and are taking the necessary steps to position our business for long-term success. We remain focused on the five foundational principles of our strategy. Keeping our people safe with a relentless commitment to our safety culture and systems; growing margins through the application of our operating, technical and exploration discipline; leveraging our exploration program and unmatched portfolio to grow reserves and resources; optimizing our world-class project pipeline and maintaining discipline around capital allocation. Thank you for your time. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Murphy of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Murphy: Hi. I had some questions on some of the former Gold Corp asset reserves. I mean if we start with Éléonore, you're getting down there in reserve life now and I'm just wondering what your confidence is to extend that back out. And what are the key factors? Is it exploration or is it more about getting costs down so you can bring in more economic ounces?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I'll start off Matt and I've got my Chief Technology Officer, Dean Gehring with me here, he might have a few comments as well. But the story for me at Éléonore is a parallel to the story you'll have seen us follow at Leeville. We have got a complex ore body where you need to make sure that geology model and your geotechnical model are well aligned and integrated to form your life of mine plan. And then you take in consideration stope sequencing and backfill and the like. That is a key focus for us at that operation. So we have applied our Newmont discipline to how we determine reserves and resources. We actually have the same people that worked through the very good work we did at Leeville several years ago, Kate Williams and Dave Thornton, the very same people are working on the ground with the team at Éléonore to build those integrated plans. And if you look at Leeville today and look at the life that it has in front of it, it's a great deal of credit can be put in the hands of Dave and Kate for that work. So, we're getting those basic models and plans in place and then combining that with an exploration program combined with full potential, bringing costs down that look to extend the life with reserves and resources that meet the Newmont standard. Dean is there anything you wanted to add to that?
Dean Gehring: Yes, thanks Tom. Matthew, one of the things, a couple of things I'd like to add to that. One is, as you probably know at Newmont, we provide and apply very high standards to how we determine our reserves and resources. And let me provide a little bit of background also get and lead up to some specifics around your question around Éléonore. So our standard for our study requirements and our drill spacing far exceeds any regulatory agencies and current codes like JORC, SEC or 43-101. And I would also say we don't apologize for having those high standards because it has resulted in us that disciplined approach, it results in us being very consistent delivering against our plan. But to illustrate the point of how that plays through in our reserves and resource calculations we can look at a mine like Cerro Negro as a starting point. And so as we applied our standards to that site, we ended up reclassifying about 1.5 million ounces, but it went from reserves to resources. And because of it's still a highly prospective area we're confident that those resources are going to come right back into reserves just as we do a little bit more work. And just quickly to illustrate the point further, if we look at Peñasquito, we see that the reserves there maintained what they were before, but through our work we actually added an additional three million ounces on the resource side. But switching to Éléonore specifically your question, if we go back to what Rob mentioned earlier, Éléonore is a complex ore body. And when we apply our demonstrated performance to the mining wits and dilutions, we ended up revising about a million ounces out of there. And the rest of the revisions really came from geologic model updates similar to what Tom mentioned earlier. So the net of all those revisions resulted in resources remaining about the same at a million ounces. But those resources that we have there are at a much higher level of confidence than they were before. But I think what's important to recognize out of all this is that we know how to mine deposits like Éléonore. To Tom's point we have a strong technical team. It allows us to deploy the resources where they're needed and it allows us to take full advantage of our full potential program and also to rapidly replicate our best practices. So, we're, I'm fully confident that we're going to continue to extend the mine life there and that we're not looking at a short mine life.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. Thank you very much. And you touched on Cerro Negro, so I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Tom, Nancy and Rob, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just around the autonomous opportunity that you've mentioned at Boddington. Just wondering if you can give a bit more color on the actual savings on a per ton of mining. And also just as a follow up, will you likely wait until seeing how that goes at Boddington or are you looking at other sites between now and 2021 in advance of that. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris. I’ll take the second part of your question and Rob, just pulling out, he can give you the answer to the second part, if not, we can go offline and get those numbers to you. Very important part of Autonomous Haulage is to vet it down and prove the operation of that technology in our gold mining environment and to manage through the change management process associated with that. So very important part of Boddington achieving the level of performance that it has and through that level of performance extending its mine life to underpin the replacement of a mining fleet with an autonomous mining fleet is an excellent opportunity for us to bring autonomous into our business. We'd be looking first foremost at using that technology to prove up the base case for some of the key projects that we have in our project pipeline. So, it'd be the very large gold copper deposits that we've got a pre-feasibility study. So proving, proving up Boddington and having that inform those pre-feasibility studies would be the first and then if there were opportunities around our business to either replace fleet or convert fleet, we would consider that. You need to have the mine life in front of you in order to be able to justify the replacement of a mining fleet. So those opportunities may present, but it's more about presenting the base case for those very important studies we have at pre-feasibility stage.
Rob Atkinson: Chris, thanks very much for the question. And we're conservatively estimating that we're going to get a 20% improvement in productivity with the trucks in terms of the material that they can move. And that will obviously transfer to a lower cost per ton. The key areas that we'll be focusing on most of all are around the shift changes. Obviously that disappears, the maintenance requirements, the increased speed, and also the ability to get greater payloads. So all-in-all where we're sitting is about a 20% initial estimate, but obviously we're going to be hoping to push that very, very hard. And we've certainly seen some great performance in other mining companies and we certainly believe we can do that and some moving forward.
Chris Terry: Thanks. Thanks Tom and Rob. And then just in terms of the operations, thinking about the 2020 progression, Just wondered if you could highlight just sort of the quarter to quarter and half to half split. I noticed you mentioned Éléonore weak in the first quarter, obviously Musselwhite second half weighted, you've gone through a couple of the other assets, but I just wanted if you could make some comments on that. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Sorry, just Chris, is there an operation particular you want to talk about?
Chris Terry: Just wondering in general as you go through your yearly guidance, just thinking about it, maybe first half versus second half or just items to look for on a quarterly progression. Just overall, I know you don't guide specifically to the quarter, but just things that we should look out for as the year goes on.
Tom Palmer: Chris, Tom here you are going to see a little bit softer first half to second half. You're looking at maybe softer, I mean like 48% versus 52% after half. So in my world, that's a pretty even year. [indiscernible] certainly at Éléonore has you are seeing some lower gold ounces, particularly the first quarter. Musselwhite you're going to obviously see a lower first half to second half as we start to feed ore and we're already feeding ore and in fact Rob is being a little bit conservative. We actually produced our first gold this week from Musselwhite and we'll ramp up that plant in the second half of the year. Just looking down the list of mine sites you're going to see in Africa, weighted to the second half of the year, particularly at Ahafo, as we start to get in some higher grade ore at Subika, they are going to be weighted to the second half of the year at Akyem as we get into some higher grade ore in their open pit, pretty even year through Tanami. Boddington, you're going start to see them get into some high grade in the second half of the year. So there's a weighting for the second half at Boddington. Pretty even through Pueblo Viejo, Cerro Negro pretty even. Merian you'll start to see them softer in the second half as we start to get into more of a high grade but harder ore and then start to price out through the primary crusher you lose mill productivity. Yanacocha, as we get into the Quecher Main stripping campaign, you'll see a bit lower in the second half to the first. Peñasquito, you'll start to see us move into higher grade ores in the second half. So a bit stronger in the second half. Éléonore, I talked about. Peñasquito a pretty even year. And CC&V, we'll start to see some high leach ounces coming through on the second half of the year. Does that give you some flavor?
Chris Terry: Yes, that's great. That's a very, very helpful. It's exactly what I was after.
Tom Palmer: And then one other Chris to keep in mind as you're looking at cash flow. We will start to ramp-up our spend on development capital as we start to ramp-up our work at Tanami 2. So you will see that that in the second half as well.
Chris Terry: Okay, great. Thanks for that. The last one from me, I mean, you've obviously done the mine divestments Kalgoorlie, Red Lake, where the portfolio stands today is there anything that's non-core? I don't think so, but I just wanted to check.
Tom Palmer: But Chris, there are 12 operations that we're going to drive value from, so you can see us absolutely focused on delivering and exceeding our commitments from those 12 operations. There are couple of areas that we're working on that aren't part of our core operations. One is that we have a power business in Kalgoorlie that's – that we're working through, if you remember from the announcement with Northern Star, they've got first rights to make an offer for that. That's material in terms of the value of that power business. And the other area we're doing is cleaning up our equity portfolio. So we're actively working on that. And you might see the order of, through the combination of all of those things up to a $300 million of proceeds, $200 million to $300 million of proceeds that may come from that. So I'd call that sweeping up, but it's a material number as we work to clean house in the first half of this year.
Chris Terry: Okay, great. That's all for me. All the best for the year. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks mate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes, thank you. Question for Rob Atkinson on Peñasquito. Just curious on the work you're doing on the front-end of the plant and how that deep bottlenecking is improving the throughput versus when you acquired the asset to where you think you can get it to.
Rob Atkinson: Well thanks. Thanks very much Greg. And very, very clear that that's where the bottleneck is, that we're sitting at a rate of 37 million ton throughput for the year. We're looking again net up to 39 very quickly. Now that certainly isn't the end to it, but as you balance the different products between the gold and the zinc and the lead and the silver, you do have to balance the backend of the plant with the front-end. But we've certainly been able to choke feed through that front end and we're looking at 39 million ton throughput.
Tom Palmer: Greg, are you coming to Peñasquito next week, because we're going to go into some detail with the folks that are visiting.
Greg Barnes: Yes, I am absolutely coming and just want to jump the gun a little bit, Tom.
Tom Palmer: All right.
Greg Barnes: On full potential have you fully deployed that across all of the Goldcorp operations now? 
Tom Palmer: Rob, you want to?
Rob Atkinson: Not quite yet that we've Éléonore is very well advanced. Obviously Peñasquito is fully advanced. That Porcupine is ramping up and given where Musselwhite is at, with the conveyor that's going to be the last one to ramp-up. But on the whole we're making very, very good progress. And, even though full potential isn't ramped up fully at Porcupine and Musselwhite, the level of engagement between our technical teams and our operational teams is very significant. So we're making very good progress.
Greg Barnes: And how about at Cerro Negro. Rob?
Rob Atkinson: Beg your pardon. The Cerro Negro was one of the first to kick off that's proceeding well and again we have a terrific SME support down there and we're focusing on some key things down there. Just a handful of things, which will make a difference and the big one is improving the development rates there and the productivity of the equipment in general. And we're certainly seeing some good early wins here.
Tom Palmer: Greg both Peñasquito and Cerro Negro through the diagnosis and design phases and firmly into their delivery phases and so we're through that and we're into the 18-months delivery. Éléonore is now in there, they've been through the diagnosis and they're now in the design phase. So the two, the two assets that deliver significant value. And Peñasquito delivers huge value, we’re firmly in the deliver phase.
Greg Barnes: Yes, it looks like you could see that in the Q4 results. Thanks Tom.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Greg.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC. Please go ahead.
Josh Wolfson: I just switching over to the capital allocation side of things with the buyback, I guess half complete within a pretty short timeframe if and when that's ultimately exhausted, I guess, prior to the full sort of timelines. How do you see that that program going forward? And I guess, what's the motivation to look at allocating funds towards that versus a dividend?
Nancy Buese: Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. So, on the buybacks, I think I would consider that really tied to our asset sales. And so between that and an opportunity to buyback shares at a very, very attractive share price, we feel like that was the right thing to do. And so, we will continue that program through the end of 2020. And we will also consider – at these gold prices when we think about capital allocation, we'll continue to manage the balance sheet and we'll think about other shareholder friendly actions. Certainly a key one of those will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go forward and sustainable basis. So that's something that we will continue to evaluate and truly to remember that that dividend at $1 is sustainable at $1,200 gold price, so at a more robust pricing going forward. That's something we will be definitely continuing to revisit.
Josh Wolfson: Okay. So it’s safe to say I guess the approach seems to be windfall cash flow is attributable to the buyback and business sustainability is a focus for the dividends.
Nancy Buese: Yes, that's correct.
Josh Wolfson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Josh.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Good morning everyone. I'm just looking at Porcupine. Could you just talk about the changes to the reserves there? I know you moved dome from – or you said you were going to move dome from reserves into resources, but to me it looks like you've taken 8 million ounces out totally out of the global inventory. Is that correct?
Tom Palmer: Probably need to go offline with you on that one, Anita. Well, certainly, we moved some Century out of reserve into resource and we certainly kept some reserve in where we could still mine those ounces. So that might be one that we can quickly get Jason Dando and Dean to jump up the line and take you through.
Anita Soni: All right. And then when you were – you talked about or Rob talked about applying your more rigorous drill density requirements. Did you also take a look at – and this is to the overall Goldcorp, all of the assets, did you also take a look at Goldcorp's cost assumptions at this stage? Or is that still to come?
Tom Palmer: We'll get Dean to comment on that one for your Anita.
Dean Gehring: Yes, Anita, we looked at the whole suite of variables that go into calculating the reserves. So we looked at the cost assumptions and also as Nancy mentioned during her part of the presentation, we also consider best demonstrated performance. So we don't build in stretch or upside into any of our reserves or resource determinations.
Anita Soni: All right. And so given that Musselwhite perhaps won't be looking to grow as it previously did. You're okay with the cost structure that's supporting the current reserves right now?
Dean Gehring: Yes. And we also took a look at that too in terms of its best demonstrated performance.
Anita Soni: All right. And then just in terms of areas where we saw declines at other assets that you own, so – and that were within your portfolio. Can you talk about – so you had some wins at Tanami and you talked a bit about that, but could you just talk about what was happening at Ahafo South as well as at – I'm sorry, at Merian?
Tom Palmer: Again, Anita, we can probably go offline on that detail, but I mean, those Ahafo South is, is ounces coming in with the changing mining method and Merian we've got ounces coming in as we continue to drill out around the terrific story at Tanami story, here us talking more about is the Oberon deposit with the first ounces coming into resource. That's got to be a terrific addition to the Tanami’s story, but I'm more than happy to maybe jump offline and go through asset by asset and take you through that detail.
Anita Soni: All right. Thank you. I look forward to that call.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Mike Jalonen: Good morning, Tom, everyone. I just had a question. We haven't really heard much of Nevada Gold Mines. I know Mark Bristow would spoke about it. But on Page 5, your synergy value chart, Mark spoke about another $60 million of synergies in Nevada lowering the cutoff grade on his call last week. I am just wondering, do any – do those fit in on Page 5 anywhere or this was Newmont?
Tom Palmer: Yes. Mark and – terrific to get a question from you. Slide 5 is just the Goldcorp synergy. So we have built into our guidance for Nevada Gold Mines, the synergies that that Barrick have provided publicly. So that's built into our plan. But in the $500 million of cash flow that we will deliver in 2021 in the $340 million of cash flow that we will deliver this year, all of that comes from the five new operations that came into our business from Goldcorp.
Mike Jalonen: Okay. All right. I'll thank you for that clarification. So you and Greg Barton's next week.
Tom Palmer: Yes, thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Graf of B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Adam Graf: Hey, everyone. Just a quick question. I'm just thinking down the line a bit longer term. You guys have some big projects that are JV-ed with some base metal producers, who have their own projects and their own balance sheet capacity. And I was just curious if you maybe could give us some color on how you're coordinating longer term with your JV partners in regards to the development and the timing of those projects considering their own – they're not benefiting from the higher gold price.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam. So, one of the beauties of our portfolio as it's some – as it's now positioned is that we have across those 12 operations and the ore bodies that sit underneath them and the three projects that we have in either definitive feasibility study or executions at Tanami 2, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides, the ability to sequence those projects in. And they are the three projects that underpin the 6 million to 7 million ounces of steady development capital spend over the better part of this decade that Nancy was talking about those three projects plus the exploration potential of our existing assets and the opportunity to improve the performance of our existing assets give us a steady profiled north of 6 million ounces for this decade at least. So we'll talk more about that in the weeks ahead. But what that allows us to do with those three big projects, Norte Abierto, Nueva Unión and Galore Creek, that I see sitting in pre-feasibility study, is for us to work with our joint venture partners to apply some of our key strategic mine planning methodology that we have within Newmont, understand those ore bodies to optimize those ore bodies to establish a competition for capital and see which of those come forward first because we'll only implement those in series, which of those will come first towards the latter part of this decade, if not the start of the next decade for implementation. And I think that sits pretty consistently with our joint venture partners thinking about those projects. So I think we're aligned. And the beauty of our portfolio is that we have plenty of time to really optimize those projects and bring them on and we will get from each of those projects along with Yanacocha Sulfides and excellent exposure to copper as the globe goes through the energy transition. So I'm very excited about our organic pipeline and I think we can work well with our JV partners to bring them on when they are ready to come on.
Adam Graf: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Tumazos: Thank you for taking my question. What’s the interruptions at Musselwhite and Peñasquito and the de-classifications at Éléonore and the Yukon and Dome and the Red Lake sale. All in all, are you still happy with the Goldcorp purchase? You appeared to buy it almost at the bottom and at about 30% of what Goldcorp had spent on its assets.
Tom Palmer: John, in a word yes. It's a fantastic acquisition. Those assets are terrific ore bodies. There are – there's excellent infrastructure and they are in very good hands and we're going to deliver huge value from them. So it was a fantastic acquisition and I think we're demonstrating what those assets can really do when they're in the hands of an operating company like Newmont.
John Tumazos: Is it a reasonable hope or expectation for the Éléonore resources to come back to reserves and also the Coffee, Yukon and Dome Century resources? Or should we limit that optimism just to Éléonore?
Tom Palmer: Yes, you should be optimistic about Éléonore and the upside potential as we apply Newmont exploration skills to that asset. For Coffee, we've put that study back where it should be in pre-feasibility study and it's one of the deposits that our head of exploration is very excited about. And we want at least two seasons of drilling to prove out that ore body. And what we're looking at with the Century project is understanding what that – that next life that what that next layback is at Porcupine. So we're actively working that project at the right level to look to see what – what we can do to bring those ounces into that business. And we're working – and we'll continue to work bloody hard at Porcupine to get their productivities up and improve their costs, which will further enhance the ability to bring – essentially what will be layback back into that mine.
John Tumazos: Thank you for your service to the company.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you everyone for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in Newmont. Have a good day. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Goldcorp’s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont Goldcorp’s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to slide two. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here, and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmontgoldcorp.com. And now, I’ll turn it over to Tom on slide three.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining our call. It has been just over a month since I moved into the CEO role, and I’m very honored to be only the tenth CEO in Newmont Goldcorp’s almost 100-year history. And I’m very excited about the strength of our portfolio, the capability of our people and the opportunities we have in front of us to safely deliver superior value for all our stakeholders. Turning to the third quarter. We delivered solid performance and have made excellent progress in delivering on the value we promised to establish Newmont Goldcorp as the world’s leading gold business. Recent highlights include completing three profitable projects on schedule and within budget; exceeding our commitments of value delivery from the Goldcorp acquisition through an acceleration of synergies and Full Potential improvements; closing the Nevada Gold Mine’s joint venture and contributing our Newmont Nevada assets in good order and continuing to improve our safety of performance and advancing our reputation for sustainability. Turning to the details on slide four. In the third quarter, we produced 1.6 million ounces of gold and all-in sustain cost of $978 per ounce, generating $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $365 million in free cash flow. We completed site visits to support the sales process for our Red Lake operation. We commissioned three projects in Borden, Ahafo Mill Expansion and Quecher Main and we approved the Tanami Expansion 2 project. I’m pleased to report that we are exceeding our synergy targets from the Goldcorp acquisition, with run rate improvements expected to reach $240 million by the end of this year, including $60 million in quick wins from Peñasquito and Cerro Negro alone. We also continue to lead the gold sector in stewardship. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share, putting us on course to return approximately $900 million to shareholders this year. We maintain a strong balance sheet with over $5 billion of liquidity, and we were recognized as the top gold miner by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for our leading ESG performance. Leading mining companies have at their core an unwavering commitment to safety and sustainability. Turning to slide five. As Chief Executive Officer, you can expect from me a relentless focus on ensuring that everyone who works at our business can do so safely, through our leadership and through the systems and processes we put in place to manage risk. There is nothing more important. My expectation is that everyone who works in our business understands the fatality risk associated with their work and are ensuring that the critical controls that are required to manage them are in place at all times. A robust safety culture is one that constantly reinforces key systems, safe behavior and actively shares lessons learned from serious incidents. This is fundamental to the wellbeing of our people and underpins our operating performance. Turning to a look at our global portfolio on slide six. We have the strongest and most sustainable portfolio in the industry. Our assets are allocated in the most balanced and favorable jurisdictions in the world with 14 operated mines and 2 non-operated joint ventures. With more than 90% of our reserves in the Americas and Australia, our global position provides an unmatched platform for near-mine, brownfields and greenfield exploration. As announced in September, we have imitated a sales process for Red Lake and interested parties have now completed their site visits. We’ve also divested our position in the Nimba iron ore project in Guinea and are strategically reviewing our equity investment portfolio.  Turning to our industry-leading project pipeline on slide seven. We have the deepest pipeline of world class projects in the gold industry, giving us significant project sequencing flexibility. We will continue to apply a disciplined and rigorous approach to optimize these projects and advance them through our investment system. Consistent project delivery and disciplined operational execution remain the cornerstones of our business and are central to creating long-term shareholder value. This year, we have successfully delivered four projects on four Continents, and in the past month alone, declared commercial production for three of these projects, Quecher Main, Ahafo Mill Expansion and Borden. Quecher Main was safely delivered on schedule and under budget and is on track to generate an internal rate of return of 15%, an improvement from 10% when we approved the project just two years ago. Ahafo Mill Expansion was also brought on line within budget for approximately $175 million, increasing mill capacity to nearly 10 million tons per annum, whilst adding 75,000 to a 100,000 ounces per year of annual gold production from 2020 to 2024. And at Borden, we are extending the life of the Porcupine complex and leading the advancement of safe and sustainable underground mining globally through state of the art health and safety controls, digital mining technologies and processes and low carbon emission vehicles. We’ve also continued to advance profitable growth. Last month, our Board unanimously approved moving the Tanami Expansion 2 project into the execution phase. We are very excited about this project’s ability to extend life beyond 2040 at our world-class Tanami mine in our core Newmont region. This project also provides the platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment at Tanami. We will provide further details on this project in the context of our long-term guidance at our webcast in December. For our mid-term projects Yanacocha Sulfides and Ahafo North, we continue to advance and optimize them through our Definitive Feasibility study work. Finally, looking at the earlier stage projects in our pipeline, we are taking patient and deliberate approach to optmizing and sequencing our larger projects including Nueva Unión, Galore Creek and Norte Abierto. These projects will compete for future capital investment, so we are proactively engaging with our joint ventures partners to ensure that the projects only advance after specific hurdles are achieved. Our robust project pipeline is a key differentiator in the gold industry and provides us with the solid pathway to steady production and cash flow generation for decades to come.  Turning to slide eight for a look at the progress on the Goldcorp integration. I’m very pleased with the pace at which we are delivering value from this acquisition. On the G&A front, we have both accelerated and increased the total synergies to a $120 million per annum. This is $35 million and more than 40% higher than our initial $85 million commitment. For supply chain, our team is actively targeting value across several fronts, including quick wins through the extension of best pricing and rebates and leveraging our increased scale and volume to reduce our input costs. Our world-class exploration team has identified over $25 million of annual program efficiencies, a figure that wasn’t considered in our initial commitment. Our Full Potential program is well and truly underway at the former Goldcorp operations. We are seeing the same improvement opportunities at these new operations to those that we had delivered from Newmont’s assets over the last seven years. And we are able to accelerate value delivery by leveraging this experience. We launched Full Potential of Peñasquito at the start of June and have had Newmont’s strongest team on the ground, supporting the site during their diagnose and design work. We have made excellent progress and the site is tracking to achieve $50 million in quick-win improvements this year alone. Full Potential has now moved into the deliver phase at Peñasquito.  At Cerro Negro, Full Potential was kicked off in July and the site is tracking to achieve $10 million in improvements that we also expect to achieve this year. In just six months since we acquired Goldcorp, we are exceeding our commitments and are tracking towards delivering $240 million in annual run rate improvements by the end of this year. This is two-thirds of the commitment we made for the end of 2021, after only six months. With that, I’ll turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, on slide nine to review our operational performance.
Rob Atkinson: Since June, I’ve had the opportunity to visit all of our sites. And the observations and discussions I had as a result have informed my immediate priorities. My highest priority is a renewed and relentless focus on safety followed by ensuring that we are demonstrating a high level of visible and felt leadership in the field. Secondly, it will be about focusing on the basics to ensure we not only hit our plan but we better it. Thirdly, we need to collaborate more across our regions to learn from each other as a whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. And finally, a strong focus on improving productivity, day in and day out. As COO, I am very much looking forward to investing in our people and local communities and raising our performance to drive greater value from what I believe to be an exceptional asset base. Before reviewing our third quarter operational performance, I’d like to congratulate Dan Janney, our new regional Senior Vice President of the North America region. Dan is an accomplished miner with 27 years of global mining operations experience, and most recently was a key Newmont leader in Nevada. He has successfully led teams to deliver step change improvements in safety, efficiency and productivity. And his appointment reflects our intention to safely improve costs and accelerate operational and efficiency improvements at our six mines in North America. I’ll now provide an overview of the North America sites on slide 10. In North America, our teams are focusing on safety and operational execution as we work to overcome headwinds and deliver a strong end to 2019, and importantly to set ourselves up for long-term success. At Peñasquito an illegal blockade began on September the 14th, resulting in a third quarter production shortfall of 11,000 gold ounces and 51,000 gold equivalent ounces from silver, lead and zinc. The blockade was lifted on October the 8th and we started shipping concentrate immediately after the blockade was listed. I’m pleased to see progress has been made with both the federal and state governments to help ensure the rule of law is upheld to enable a sustainable operating environment. On October the 22nd, we began restarting operations. And yesterday, we also restarted government sponsored discussions with members of the Cedros community exclusively. And I look forward to reaching a sustainable and long-term win-win solution to this local issue. The site is now safely back to full operation. The stripping campaign in the main Peñasco pit is nearing completion and we expect to maintain higher grades in the fourth quarter and into 2020. As Tom mentioned, our Full Potential work at Peñasquito has firmly moved into the deliver phase with the $50 million of quick win improvements. I’m very excited about the team’s work to progress the incremental $200 million of cost and productivity initiatives. Similar to Boddington six years ago, the majority of the improvements are expected to come from the mill with a focus on increasing throughput and reducing maintenance downtime. At Porcupine, we achieved commercial production at the Borden underground mine on October the 1st. Ore from Borden is processed at the existing Porcupine mill and will extend profitable production at the mining complex in Timmins, Ontario. We also see exploration upside at Borden as the deposit remains open at depth. At Musselwhite, rehabilitation work is nearing completion, and we recently executed contracts for engineering, construction and the installation of a new conveyor system. Whilst the replacement of the conveyor is underway, we are getting ahead on development and building inventory to sustainable levels. As we head into the next year we plan to have three or four stopes available at one time. And going forward, very importantly, our plan is to be 18 months ahead on development work. Musselwhite is currently operating in the mining area halfway down the mine as we also continue to push the [indiscernible] and exploration drift at the bottom of the mine in order to improve and ensure mining and/or flexibility in the future. We expect to begin recognizing production and sales in the second quarter of 2020, once the mill is processing the stockpile material we are currently trucking to surface. And we will back to normal operations in early October when we bring the conveyor back online. The Musselwhite materials handling project is tracking to be fully operational by mid-2020 with the shaft installation nearing commission and dry commissioning of the new crushing and conveyor systems well underway. At Éléonore, mining continues in Horizon 5 and we expect to reach higher grades in the fourth quarter. However, third quarter production was slightly lower than expected due to mine sequence. The operations is developing an integrated geotechnical and mine planning system to determine the optimal approach for safely and sustainably progressing through the lower zones to minimize mining-induced stresses. Full Potential has now commenced at Éléonore, and we are progressing the key diagnose phase of this program. And we are leveraging our experience from all of our other underground mines to identify the highest value improvement opportunities. At Red Lake, operations fully resumed in October after we completed work to install additional safety controls at lower levels of the mine, and we recently recommenced mining of Cochenour. As the sales process progresses, we continue to focus on the safe and efficient operation of this mine. Finally, at CC&V, we expect to finish the year strongly as we recover the fair ounces from the VLF1 leach pad. Now to discuss our South America operations on slide 11. At Merian, we delivered steady third quarter performance, sustained improvements in mine productivity and mill performance. We’re now transitioning into harder rock, which will present higher grade and improved mine productivity. Yanacocha delivered solid production with the drawdown of ounces from our existing La Quinua leach pad. With Quecher Main reaching commercial production in October, we expect to see recovery of ounces from the new Carachugo leach pad in 2020. I’d like to congratulate our South America team for safely delivering this important project that will sustain the Yanacocha’s mine life and serve as a the bridge to the future growth opportunities in the years ahead. At Cerro Negro, we kicked off our full potential process, which has been in full swing since July and our team has identified $10 million of quick wins, mainly from improving mine development rates while setting the course to design and implement opportunities such as shift optimization, maintenance scheduling and basic operational improvements. And I’m looking forward to providing an update on our progress during our guidance webcast. We are tracking to a strong fourth quarter as we mine an average grade of 3 -- 13.8 grams per ton. Turning now to our Australia operations on slide 12. At Tanami, we delivered another solid quarter and expect the fourth quarter to reflect the operation’s lowest cost and highest production for the year as we access higher grade stopes. At Boddington, our planned stripping campaign in the south pit is progressing very well. And during the third quarter, we safely completed mill maintenance activities. Unit costs have improved with higher ore tons mined, and a favorable foreign exchange rate. And at KCGM, we continued to strongly focus on increasing mine productivity whilst managing within the constraints of current geotechnical challenges and the associated remediation work in the Fimiston pit. We are optimizing mill recoveries as the Morrison startup pit starts to present higher grade ore. As a result of the exclusion zones we put in place to safely manage the east and west walls of the pit, 2019 production will be impacted by 40,000 ounces, and we have adjusted our regional outlook accordingly. But above all else, we will always ensure that our workforce is safe whilst we proactively manage through these geotechnical challenges with pragmatic mine plans and a high level of monitoring of all of our high walls. We also continue to determine the most appropriate design for a layback to further manage risk and access the gold ounces, which remain in the pit. Underground operations are progressing well. On the project front, we’re excited that Tanami Expansion 2 is unanimously approved by our Board for execution. The team is progressing development work, and shaft sinking has advanced beyond 210 meters, and we expect to commence raise boring in quarter one 2020. This is a terrific project which will deliver a significant value, increase mine life and provide a platform for further exploration. Now to our Africa operations on slide 13. Ahafo delivered another quarter of solid performance as we continued mining higher grades from Subika open pit and realized initial benefits from the successful ramp-up of the Ahafo Mill Expansion project. The expansion accelerates efficient processing of ore from stockpiles, and the Subika underground mine, as well as harder lower grade ore from Ahafo’s existing pits. Successful project execution has positioned the operation to generate a strong fourth quarter and a record 2019. At Akyem, we also delivered yet another solid quarter and are pleased to have recently connected both, our Africa operations to our operations support hub in Perth. The process control staff are now remotely analyzing real time data from Akyem and collaborating with the site to deliver SAG mill improvements. We’ve identified approximately $20 million to $25 million of annual opportunities at Akyem and Ahafo from throughput and recovery improvements that will be implemented over three years. This is a great example of the value that can be generated from operating as one, fully connected global mining business. Looking forward, we’ve now established a solid platform to further evaluate growth from this prospective district. As we continue progressing our underground exploration, I’m excited by the potential of Subika and adjacent ore bodies, and are actively evaluating and prioritizing these growth opportunities on a value versus risk basis. Wrapping up with our 2019 operational outlook on slide 14. Our full-year outlook now incorporates Nevada Gold Mines from July the 1st, which lowered our production by 45,000 ounces, improved our overall unit costs and lowered our exploration and advanced project spend by approximately $35 million. We also updated the North America and Australia regions to include the impacts of the last Peñasquito blockade and current mining constraints at KCGM. These have been partially offset by improved unit costs at Boddington. Our development capital outlook has been lowered to $550 million as increases for Nevada Gold Mines and Ahafo are offset by lower spend in North and South America. In summary, we expect to deliver approximately 6.3 million attributable ounces of gold and deliver all-in sustaining costs of approximately $965 per ounce in 2019. We remain fully focused on safely improving productivity and lowering costs to generate sustainable long-term value. And we’ll provide an update on our progress at our guidance webcast on December the 2nd. With that, I’ll hand it over to Nancy on slide 15.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Rob. Turning to slide 16 for the financial highlights. In the third quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $2.7 billion, which increased 57% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from the Goldcorp assets and higher gold prices, adjusted net income of $292 million or $0.36 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.1 billion, a 70% increase over the prior year quarter. Cash from continuing operations was $793 million, an increase of 85%, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow of $365 million increased more than $200 million over the prior year quarter; free cash flow per share of $0.44 of which we paid $0.14 per share in dividends. As a reminder, our third quarter results proportionately consolidated the Company’s ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines. For the third quarter our 38.5% of the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture contributed 334,000 ounces and generated $234 million of EBITDA. Turning to slide 17 for a review of earnings per share in more detail. Third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $2.2 billion or $2.71 per share. The primary adjustment was a $2.88 gain related to the creation of Nevada Gold Mines. The gain represents the difference between the fair value of Newmont’s 38.5% ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines and the carrying value of the Newmont Nevada assets contributed to the joint venture. Other adjustments included $0.49 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts, $0.03 related to transaction and integration costs, and $0.01 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we reported adjusted net income of $0.36 per diluted share. Turning to slide 18. We remain well-positioned to execute our capital priorities including maintaining an investment grade balance sheet, investing in the next generation of mines to improve margins and build a stronger reserve base, and returning cash to shareholders through our sustainable quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. In September, we issued $700 million of debt at a rate of 2.8%, which was the lowest 10 years metal and mining coupon ever and is a testament to our leading financial position. Before using the proceeds to pay off $626 million of debt due on October 1st, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. Looking forward we are well-positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value-creation. And now, I’ll hand it back to Tom to wrap up on slide 19.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Turning to slide 20. We are building momentum to deliver a strong fourth quarter and ensuring we are taking the necessary steps to position our business for long-term success. We remain focused on the five foundational principles of our strategy: Keeping our people safe with a relentless commitment to our safety culture and systems; growing margins through the application of our operating, technical and exploration discipline; leveraging our exploration program and unmatched portfolio to grow reserves and resources; optimizing our world-class project pipeline; and maintaining discipline around capital allocation. Thank you for your time. With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Parkin of National Bank. Please go ahead.
Mike Parkin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking back at slide eight where you’re showing where your initial target on synergies was and where you’ve transitioned to today. It looks like the G&A savings are -- if that right hand bars chart is proportional, has grown substantially. Just trying to get an idea of what is benefited from your initial kind of look to where you are today. And then, also if you could provide any kind of sense of what the breakdown in that G&A savings would be, just ballpark from a percentage basis on a corporate versus the site base?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Mike. It’s Tom here. So, the G&A number is a $120 million that you see on the right hand side, which is an increase from the initial commitment we made of $85 million. That value comes from collapsing two companies into one. So it’s the value that comes from no longer having a corporate headquarters in Vancouver and starting to run Newmont Goldcorp like we ran Newmont before we acquired Goldcorp. So, that -- the vast majority of that value is coming from corporate costs. And it’s about the focus we have had on driving down our overhead costs that we’re running this business as efficiently as we can. And from my position, we’re not finished yet. I think there is still more work for us to do to set this business up to run efficiently and as we move into 2020, you can expect to hear more from on that. 
Mike Parkin: Great. Thanks very much, and congrats on the progress on that target.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Matthew Murphy of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Murphy: Hi. I just had question on the ramp-up at Musselwhite. So, when you’re talking about rebuilding inventories, those are underground inventory, or it’s stope availability, or it’s actual, or at surface?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Matthew. I’ll pass microphone across to Rob Atkinson to your question.
Rob Atkinson: Thanks, Matthew. Very simply, it’s material that we are currently trucking up from underground to the surface. And when those stocks get to the sufficient level, we’ll restart the plant next year. But, it is all that’s currently being mined halfway down the mine.
Matthew Murphy: Okay. And then, the reason for not starting the mill till later is just it’s going to be insufficient quantities till then. Is that right?
Rob Atkinson: That’s correct. The best way to run a mill is flat out to not at all. And we want to make sure that we’re in a position of not starting and stopping.
Matthew Murphy: Sure, okay. And so, is this progress in line with what you had previously guided on Musselwhite?
Rob Atkinson: It very much is. And certainly I was up there a couple of weeks ago. So, the operation firsthand, the team’s making great progress. And I mentioned in the discussion that we’ve awarded the contracts. So, segmentation are on board. And we really are pushing that project to bring it on by early October next year. So, very good progress.
Matthew Murphy: And then, just the last one related to Musselwhite is, those insurance proceeds looks like 45 million since the fire, do you expect to get more proceeds there or is there a cap on what you can get?
Nancy Buese: We do. There is a cap and we have not previously disclosed that but suffice it to say, we’re working with the carriers and the underwriters now to settle that claim. And our hope is to try to wrap that up by the end of the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Chris Terry: A few questions for me. Maybe we could just start at Peñasquito a lot of moving parts there. Just wondering if you could comment on the last technical report you had out versus how we should expect the run right from here. I think, you mentioned higher throughput, 50 million, Full Potential savings. So, just wanted to sort of think about how that asset is shaping up in forward periods? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Chris, I’ll pick up that one and maybe pass across to Rob to add any color. The $50 million quick wins comes from some very straightforward things, parking up 14 pieces of mining equipment that are excess to requirements, parking up an overland waste conveyer that’s required and taking a team from Boddington and tuning those SAG mills, so runs efficiently, and a bit of work around how we design a polygon in the mine and how we dig to the polygon. So, as Rob talks about some really basic things that we’re doing at Peñasquito. The thing that gets me really excited about Peñasquito and the value that it can deliver at the parallels between Peñasquito and Boddington. And I’d laid the turnaround at Boddington over the last six or seven years. And I can see the same story at Peñasquito and the opportunity for us to improve throughput particularly at the front end of that mill attacking all of that experience from Boddington and rapidly applying to a Peñasquito is what gets me very excited about the value and the upside that we can deliver from Peñasquito. In terms of long-term view, less than four weeks, we’re providing our guidance for five years. That’s probably the best way to give you a summary of how Peñasquito is going to shape up over the next five years or so. 
Chris Terry: And then, maybe just to ask a question on the slide going through the synergies another way. Of the 40 million that you’ve added, the $240 million, just wondering if you could comment on what we should see of that actually flowing through to the cash line, so actually on the operating line. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Yes. You’ll start to see that flowing through. I’ll pass across to Nancy to -- she’s probably better placed to answer that question.
Nancy Buese: Yes. So, you’ll see -- as we recognize some of the full potential benefits, you’ll see those in a variety of ways. You will see them in improved cost structure, you may see them in terms of improved production and productivity and a few other places. So, I would say it’s a balance between cost and production probably swayed significantly more towards costs. And we will continue to refine those numbers as we present them to you over the quarters and recognizing folks want to understand how this is actually flowing through AISC and how will it flow through production. And again, as Tom mentioned, you’ll see most of that represented in our December guidance, and that will be the best benchmark for how to how to understand those savings. But we get to ask and will continue to provide transparency on that as we move forward.
Chris Terry: Okay. Thanks, Nancy. And then, in terms of just following up on the costs as well. Just at Tanami, I just wondered if you could comment, thinking about the expansion, the second phase and where that asset is at. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you’ve seen on the cost reduction from the pipeline versus your original expectations and whether the benefits coming through there? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Again, we’ll provide some more detail to build upon the information we’ve provided a previously, in a few weeks’ time, with our long-term guidance. But that project continues to meet our internal rates of return. So, it continues to present as a very profitable mine. And I’d expect that we’ll be able to show some good cost improvements in our story that continues from the one that we’ve shared with you over the last 12 months for that expansion of that operation.
Chris Terry: Thanks, Tom. The last one for me, just in terms of the guidance going forward and maybe you will have more color in the next month or so. But, are you going to be guiding on an asset-by-asset basis or going to more of a regional approach like you have in this release? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Chris, you will see the same asset by asset approach for Newmont Goldcorp going forward that you had for Newmont in the past. So, for the next 12 months, you will see asset-by-asset, you’ll see three years by region, you’ll see five years for the portfolio, same as we’ve done for a number of years now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes. Thank you. Rob, in your comments at Peñasquito and the discussions you have in there, you specifically said you’re talking to the Cedros community only. I’m wondering where the trucking company and their issues lie now?
Rob Atkinson: It’s a good question. And going back to what I said, the key relationship we have is with the communities and that’s where it’s got to start and finish. The CAVA trucking live some in that community, other elsewhere, but very simply our discussions are with that community and that’s what we’ve got to solve with the government, both state and federal that we are having other discussions to make sure that the Cedros community is first and foremost, and that’s where our discussions lie, and that’s where we are absolutely targeting to deliver long-term sustainable future. So, certainly, our priority is with the Cedros community. And CAVA, we have to manage on ongoing basis, but our focus again is for Cedros.
Greg Barnes: Is it mostly the water issues that you’re dealing with there?
Rob Atkinson: Very much, the water is the key part, the other thing is that we want to have an ongoing relationship. Relationship shouldn’t be transactional. And we want to make sure that the Cedros community is benefiting from the presence of our operation there. But a large part of that is to have reliable, predictable and a high quality of source of water. So, that forms a large part of the discussions, but certainly not the only part.
Greg Barnes: Thanks for that. And Tom, the Q4 is shaping up to be a very good quarter, north of 1.8 million ounces I guess from what your guidance suggests. I guess, the only issue there is that Goldcorp had a history of loading everything up into the fourth quarter and then there was a bit of pull back after that. Is Q4 more of a run rate or is it a one-hit wonder and things pull back? How do you see things moving forward?
Tom Palmer: Well, there are number of factors driving our strong fourth quarter and they are not from former Goldcorp assets. You’ve got Ahafo Mill Expansion that’s going to have full quarter of run rate. You’re moving into higher grade ore at KCGM, you’re moving into higher grade ore at Tanami. So, there are a number of former Newmont assets that are contributing to that fourth quarter. So, it’s a factor of mine sequence. And when our mines are reaching some of the high grade ore, that’s driving a higher fourth quarter this year. And when we guide in December, we’ll give you some indication through our guidance as to how 2020 is shaping up in terms of a year -- half year on half year or quarter-on-quarter performance.
Rob Atkinson: And I think, Tom, if I could also just add that one of the key things that we are doing next year is to make sure that we’re well set up for the long-term future. And as an example of that at Éléonore, we’re working very closely to make sure that our stoping sequence is right that we’ve got that flexibility and also that we’re doing the Musselwhite to make sure that we’re no longer in that one stope position that we were just 12 months ago that we’ve actually got several stopes. So, all the work that we are doing is very much focused on the long-term and we’re setting mines up as such.
Greg Barnes: Does the gold have more of a consistent production profile through the year?
Rob Atkinson: Greg, it’s about following the mine sequence and how the grade presents through a portfolio 13 or 14 operations. So, we don’t try and optimize to get smooth quarter-on-quarter. We look to optimize on what’s the best value and then, let those mine plans, those mine sequence follow in good order. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just had a question on Éléonore and Porcupine. I guess, when the Goldcorp deal was first done, those are deemed as potentially non-core. Now that you have had them for almost two quarters, I’m just wondering what you’re thinking on those two assets are?
Tom Palmer: Just to clarify, Carey, we never said Éléonore was a potential optimization asset. It’s a core asset in our business, and the exploration potential around Éléonore is first class. And that’s the region we are very happy to have our foot on. So, I don’t know where that story has come from but that’s never been the case. Porcupine, some really good opportunities around Porcupine to optimize that operation, particularly as we look to bring in Borden and the contribution from Borden and upside from Borden. So, our focus with Porcupine is on optimizing the value from that asset.
Carey MacRury: Okay. Thanks. And then, maybe on the 2020 guidance, I think, your preliminary numbers were at 7.4 million ounces, given the blockade at Peñasquito and what’s happened with Musselwhite and potentially KCGM, are those the three items that you would have had -- that we should potentially be taking our 2020 numbers down a bit by or are there other items that should offset those when we think about 2020? I know you’re in the middle of your guidance process?
Tom Palmer: It’s a bit of apples to oranges when you start to compare from that March guidance to what we’ll present in 2020. You’ve got -- since March, we’ve formed a joint venture in Nevada. So, you’ll see the impact of production and costs from that joint venture that we’ll talk to in that first week of December. You’ve got a potential divestment of Red Lake that comes into that equation. You’ve got different mining sequence from Peñasquito as you flagged, in terms of when ore might present. So, there are number of factors that come into play. At Ahafo, we’re moving into a different mining method next year as we mine the Subika underground mine with a sub level shrinkage method that wasn’t back in March 4. So, there are a number of factors that will be different from March 4 to what we present in the first week of December. We will provide clear explanation of that when we provide our long-term guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. 
Tanya Jakusconek: Maybe for Tom. Congratulations on the full potential that you’re seeing ahead of budget there. I wanted to ask about 2020. I know that we talked previously that 80% of your expected synergies are going to be captured in 2020 and you would be exiting the year at 100%. But since you’ve been doing better than anticipated, is that something that we think you’re going to be doing better than that 80%, have you changed that target at all?
Tom Palmer: So, 40% run rate by the end of this year, 80% by the end of 2020, and 100% by the end of 2021 was the initial commitment that we made. We are now sitting at essentially 66% of that run rate at the end of 2020. As part of our long-term guidance again in four weeks’ time, we will give you an update in terms of how we’re tracking based upon that guidance against that initial commitment that we made.
Tanya Jakusconek: I look forward to hearing more about that. And maybe just on divestiture, you mentioned Red Lake, potentially not being in 2020 guidance. Does it look like something could close before year-end?
Tom Palmer: We’re on track with the process we’re running. We’ve just completed the site visits. So, we remain on track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead. 
Anita Soni: Good morning, everyone. So, my question is with regards to Éléonore. Could you just talk about the grade -- the lower grades that you have this quarter and how you see that playing out over the next little while?
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Anita. I’ll pass the microphone across to Rob Atkinson to take you through that.
Rob Atkinson: No problem. Good morning, Anita. It’s really very simple that we’ve been working hard to get the stocks back into a good sequence so that we’re minimizing all the mining stresses that we are looking at certainly higher grade coming into the quarter four. So, very, very simply, it’s those two issues that I think we’re getting back into a better sequence and the stocks which are presenting are of a higher grade. So, that’s all there is to it.
Anita Soni : All right. And then, similarly on Cerro Negro lower grades, I think you’re citing Eureka and Mariana Norte has higher grades in fourth quarter. But, as I recall, Eureka grades weren’t all that high. So, I’m just -- I think, you had 10-gram per ton overall this quarter. And I think what I know of Eureka, what was left was about 10-gram per ton material. So, was there some pod that you had not mined yet that was for higher grade?
Rob Atkinson: I’m not 100% sure, to be honest, but certainly we’ve -- at Cerro Negro, we’ve just been progressing the plan, we’re certainly into a very high grade moving forward this next quarter, but perhaps Tom?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I think, Anita, why don’t we get Jess to pick up with you after the call and she can take you through the detail of that question?
Anita Soni: Sure. And then, just in terms of the debt issuance and then repaying the debt on October 1st. I’m just curious why you didn’t use cash balances to just pay off that debt and move on? I know that your net debt to EBITDA is around 1 at the $1,500 goal that we just experienced, but closer to about 1.5, if you use the prior quarter’s run rate on EBITDA?
Nancy Buese: Yes, Anita, a great question. And what we really wanted to do is, as we take on both the acquisition of the Goldcorp assets in the JV, we wanted to ensure we had maximum financial flexibility. So, we had an opportunity at an unbelievable coupon to just refinance that for now. But, that’s one thing we’ve really continued to think about. At today’s higher gold prices, debt repayment will be a significant priority. We just wanted to give ourselves some flexibility as we’re taking on what Newmont looks like today. But, you can certainly anticipate, as we are experiencing these prices, a significant amount of those dollars will be pointed towards debt reduction of those 21 through 23 debt towers.
Anita Soni: Thank you. And then, last one, just a little bit more on the -- trying to get you to reveal something as everyone else has on the guidance coming up. In terms of Musselwhite, when you put out the 7.4 million ounces, I think that was in June of -- it was with Q2 results when you put out 7.4. Did that incorporate the impact of the Musselwhite fire which you think happened at the end of the first quarter?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. The numbers you’re quoting there, Anita, go back to our guidance from early March, but don’t incorporate the impact of the Musselwhite fire that happened in late March.
Anita Soni: All right. So, this would probably have been more like the annualized run rate pre-fire would have been in that 7.4 million ounces?
Rob Atkinson: Yes. That’s a good judgment to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaip of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaip: Hey, thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Look, just a little bit more on Musselwhite, early October is when you’re guiding towards commercial production. I’m wondering if you can walk us through the steps and what the critical path there is, that’s determining early October. Is it the completion of the conveyance system or is it material handling system isn’t going to be commercial by that time. So, just a bit more clarity would be…
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Andrew. It’s not linked to the materials handling system, it’s the replacement conveyor. And I’ll get Rob to take you through some detail on that.
Rob Atkinson: No problem. Thanks, Andrew. And again, this is a sequence of events. So, really the -- what we’ve been working hard on at the moment is the rehabilitation and the dewatering. That had to be done to be completed. We’ve got one more area which is a transfer point to demolish and salvage some of the old gear, and that will be done over the coming months. The contract in place to get a suitably qualified experience contractor was also a part, and that’s been awarded and we expect full site mobilization to be completed by early January. Now, as Tom mentioned, the materials handling, it’s a very important part. If you remember that we’ve got a shaft and we’ve got conveyor at Quecher, that’s being commissioned, and we’re expecting that to be fully commissioned roundabout the end of the first quarter. The mechanical completion of the belt we’re expecting to be somewhere towards the end of the second, early third quarter, and then that’s where we can do the plant completion the technical support and the ramp up to allow us to get to October. So certainly, while it’s not the material handling system, the material handling system only comes into zone with the belt running, and that’s when we can get the true efficiencies. So, we’re going to get a double whammy that when the belt comes back, it’s going to be a lot more efficient domain in general with the materials handling system as well. But, that’s the sequence of event that we’re looking at over the next nine months, nine or 10 months.
Andrew Kaip: All right. Thank you. And then, when we think about Musselwhite on go forward basis, the full production, how many stopes are you thinking that you have available or -- to be able to meet the production expectations and guidance and give you that flexibility that you can look out efficiently?
Rob Atkinson: I think, a good rule of thumb is for, if we’re in for that and certainly I think we’ll be comfortable for the couple of reasons is that it gives us the flexibility, if there is challenges with stopes, it also give us the flexibility with grade. And the key to all that is making sure that our development is well ahead that whether there is a Musselwhite to any of our other mines keeping that 18 months in advance is so key. But, a good rule of thumb we are aiming at just to just have at least four. 
Andrew Kaip: Right. 
Tom Palmer: And just another comment, Andrew, on putting keeping Musselwhite is an important mine in our portfolio of 14, given the context of our portfolio represents approximately 200,000 to 250,000 ounces. So, one of the advantages of having a portfolio of our size and spread globally is that we can manage through this issue. But, it’s at that scale compared to our portfolio.
Andrew Kaip: Okay. And then, just one final question, just on Peñasquito, you had indicated the grades would be stepping up in the fourth quarter from where they are currently. I’m just wondering what kind of step-up and can we expect. There is a fairly significant grade difference between what was previously forecasted for 2019 and then what 2020 was and that’s move. So, I’m just wondering how much a step up should we be expecting.
Tom Palmer: Again, Andrew, I’ll get Rob to take you through some of that detail. 
Rob Atkinson: The grades, we are about to hit some good material in the mine after the pre-stripping has been done. So we are going to have sustained period where the grade is going to be higher. I think, a good rule of thumb is about 0.5 gram per ton is where we’re typically sitting for the final quarter. 
Andrew Kaip: Okay. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Tumazos: Thank you very much for taking my question. Could you elaborate a little bit? There was a sentence or two towards the end of the presentation that mentioned Galore Creek, Norte Abierto and Nueva Unión. Are those projects that you’re optimistic about because they’re very large or because the pending data that might be developed over the next couple years as Newmont does their work, may improve the project, or because of the existing data on the project or because you expect higher copper and gold prices to improve the returns?
Tom Palmer: What we like about those three projects that we have sitting at prefeasibility stage is the very long life that they present. And I can underpin investment thesis for the Newmont Goldcorp that represents very long life that can go out through the next two or three decades or beyond. And where those projects sit, all three of them in prefeasibility study phase is it gives us in conjunction with our joint venture partners the opportunity to really work on and optimize those projects, get good competition for capital going, so that they present in the second half of the next decade as the first project that may come on to extend the life of our business. We look at those projects as doing them in series, not parallel. So, you can look at those three projects, the opportunity to optimize them and then sequence them, you can have those three projects come on through the latter part of the 2020s into the 2030s, and into the 2040s and really underpinning long life for our business.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: So, I was just wondering, when you do the December 2nd guidance and outlook, will you address reserves at the acquired assets at that point or would that be a February Q4 phenomenon?
Tom Palmer: Anita, it’s Tom here. It’s be February, and we will make sure that we bring that information out. Typically, we drop a press release, but I think for next year, we’ll make sure we signal that and take you through that information as that’s ready. But, it’s a -- into the New Year exercise for us to complete all that work.
Anita Soni: And will it incorporate, I mean, your assumptions on where the costs could go or will it just sort of benchmark to where you are now?
Tom Palmer: You’re asking the question in terms of reserve pricing?
Anita Soni: Yes, reserve pricing. I mean, one side of the equation where reserve is -- the cost associated with it?
Tom Palmer: Yes. I wouldn’t expect our reserve pricing to change from $1,200.
Anita Soni: But, I mean, the unit cost assumptions that are used on the other side of the equation to say okay we’re mining at 90 bucks a ton Éléonore versus say 110, which is -- I’m just pulling numbers out of the air, but I’m just wondering, will it include sort of the benchmarking of what’s actually happening at the asset right now or some future projection of what you think you can deliver?
Tom Palmer: For the operating assets, it will be underpinned by the mine plans that underpin our business. So, it’ll be the assumptions we have used.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury: Hi. Just one more question on -- just wondering if you could touch on the Coffee project. I know you’ve pushed it back in the development pipeline. Just wondering what the work plan there looks like going forward.
Tom Palmer: We’ve pushed that back, the prefeasibility because we think there’s exploration upside potential there that we want to better understand. Marcelo Godoy, our Head of Exploration is particularly excited about the opportunity around Coffee. But, what we’re looking at is doing the drilling program to better define that resource and keep that project in prefeasibility stage and so we can better understand that, optimize that project, and then bring it forward in competition with the other project. It sits alongside in prefease.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.
Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. And thank you for your continued interest in Newmont Goldcorp. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont Goldcorp's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont Goldcorp's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer; Tom Palmer, President; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.Turning to slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here, and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmontgoldcorp.com.And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Jess, and thank you for joining our call. We delivered strong performance in the second quarter, and continued our work to establish Newmont Goldcorp as the world's leading gold business.Highlights for the quarter included: closing the deal to acquire Goldcorp with the overwhelming support of our shareholders; making steady progress on integrating assets and aligning teams with our proven strategy; completing an historic joint venture with Barrick to create the world's largest gold-producing complex; and meeting our ongoing commitment to deliver leading operational, financial and sustainability performance.Turning to the details on slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.6 million ounces of gold, and delivered all-in sustaining cost of $1,016 per ounce, and continued to improve cost and efficiencies across the portfolio.We're on track to achieve a run rate of $365 million in annual improvements from the Goldcorp acquisition by early 2021, and we launched our Full Potential continuous improvement program at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro. This program has delivered more than $2 billion in improvements since 2013.The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the second quarter, we approved the Awonsu layback to extend the life at Ahafo's open pit mine. We supported the completion of the Nevada Gold Mine's joint venture, and we continued to advance profitable projects including the Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main and Borden, all of which will reach commercial production later this year.The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we returned $590 million in dividends to our shareholders; maintained a strong balance sheet with an investment-grade credit rating, and nearly $5 billion of liquidity; and we were recognized as one of the top companies in the world for our leading social, environmental and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.Turning to slide 5. While our combined safety performance improved in the second quarter, we remain focused on achieving zero harm across our portfolio. That focus includes, reporting and sharing significant events that hold the potential to impact safety and embedding our fatality risk management program to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and injuries.Over the last six months, we've also been driving efforts to eliminate live maintenance work as another effective way to protect our people from injuries. We were honored to be recognized as one of the world's leading corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility Magazine, and the only mining company to make the list for our performance. This recognition is a tribute to the commitment our teams bring to leading sustainability performance and a key measure of how well we run our business.Turning to a look at our global portfolio on slide 6. Our operations are based in four regions and managed under our proven operating model. Taken together, Newmont Goldcorp offers investors, an unparalleled portfolio of mines, projects and reserves in favorable jurisdictions. In fact, 90% of our reserves are based in the Americas and Australia.Sustainable gold production, targeting between 6 million and 7 million ounces per year with another $1.5 billion of annual revenue from copper, zinc, lead and silver production and the financial flexibility needed to continue investing in profitable growth and delivering an industry-leading dividend.Finally, we offer strong leadership and a wealth of technical expertise to make the most of these assets. I visited Éléonore and Porcupine last week and I was pleased to see the progress the teams are making to align and integrate these operations and the ongoing work by the combined teams to make the Nevada gold mine's joint venture a success.With that, I'll turn it over to Tom on slide 7 to discuss our operational performance and recent integration work.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Gary. Before reviewing our operational performance and integration work, I'd like to take a moment and welcome Rob Atkinson, our new Chief Operating Officer, who you will hear from next quarter. Over the past 25 years, Rob has delivered step-change improvements in safety, productivity and sustainability in the mining sector.We are excited to have Rob on board, as he brings a demonstrated commitment to building strong safety cultures and to leading and empowering teams to achieve meaningful business results. With his capability and experience, Rob's addition to our leadership team will help to drive the delivery of value we have identified through our combination with Goldcorp.Now beginning with a review of our regional performance on slide 8. Our North American operations were impacted by near-term challenges in the second quarter. The performance is expected to improve in the second half, as we work to fully integrate the Goldcorp assets and set them up for sustainable future success.At Peñasquito, operations safely ramped back up in June and concentrate inventories are almost back to normal levels. During the shutdown, the team brought forward maintenance on various plant and equipment. The remainder of 2019 and into 2020, grades are expected to steadily improve as we complete the stripping campaign in the main Peñasco pit. And we also launched our Full Potential Program at that operation and I'll touch a bit more on that later.On June 17, we began good-faith dialogue with a trucking company in the Cedros community. And just last week, the team hosted a session on-site. The stakeholders were able to see firsthand the focus we have on environmental compliance, order efficiency, social development and long-term community water plans and more.At Musselwhite, the rehab of the conveyor ramp is around 70% complete. Secondary egress has been successfully established, allowing us to recommence both development activities and work on the materials handling project earlier this month.The focus for the remainder of 2019 will be on replacing the conveyor system and using this period as an opportunity to get ahead on development work. At Éléonore, we have begun accessing higher grade in the Horizon five zone and preparations are underway to launch Full Potential in the fourth quarter. We also continued to advance materials handling project to improve productivity from lower levels of the mine.At Porcupine, the Borden Project remains on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter. And at Red Lake production at Cochenour was ramping up in the second quarter. However, in early July, we proactively paused the underground operations in order to strengthen our controls following an in-depth review of a historical underground area.Partial underground operations resumed a few days later, following the implementation of additional controls. And over the course of this quarter, we'll be installing some further control measures and expect to return to full underground operations during Q4.Turning to CC&V. We delivered steady production during the quarter and have signed a toll milling agreement with Nevada gold mines to continue processing concentrate in Nevada. In the second quarter, our Nevada operations performed as planned with Carlin safely completing its annual shut on Mill 6. And on July 1, we closed the Nevada joint venture and Barrick assumed operatorship of the Nevada gold mines. We look forward to working together and supporting the joint venture's efforts to unlock significant value over the years ahead.Turning to South America on slide 9. Yanacocha delivered another solid quarter, with continued higher grades in the Tapado Oeste pit and drawdown at La Quinua leach pad. And at Merian continued productivity improvements helped offset seasonal wet weather.At Cerro Negro, second quarter performance was in line with our expectations. And we anticipate a stronger second half as we reach higher grades from the Eureka and Marina Norte.We launched Full Potential earlier this month, with the focus on improving development and mining rates, maximizing recoveries and applying our asset management methodologies at that operation.Looking forward, Quecher Main continues on schedule, with commercial production expected in the fourth quarter. Turning to Australia on slide 10, Tanami, delivered another solid performance coming off higher grades in the first quarter. And we are starting to see the cost benefits from the transition to natural gas-fired power.Boddington continues to progress the stripping campaign in the South Pit and expects to reach higher grades in Q4. We recently advanced our autonomous haulage study, with the potential to reach a full funds decision later this year.If approved, the project is expected to improve cost and mining productivity, by converting the fleet of 39 haul trucks to autonomous operation, using the Cat command system.At KCGM, geotechnical remediation work on the east wall of the Fimiston pit is ongoing. We are starting to see production from the Morrison starter pit. And expect to reach higher grades in the second half.And Tanami Expansion 2 continued advancing towards a full funds decision in the second half. Engineering works are ongoing. And shaft sinking has progressed beyond the 150 meters.Turning to Africa, on slide 11, Akyem again delivered strong quarterly production on the back of higher grades. And new Full Potential initiatives associated with optimizing grounding and improving recoveries.At Ahafo, we continue to benefit from higher grades in both the Subika open pit and underground. We recently approved funding for further laybacks of the Awonsu pit. And while we anticipate first gold from these laybacks in the fourth quarter of this year, the majority of the benefits flow from 2024 to 2029.These laybacks extend the life of Ahafo surface mines by another four years. And the Ahafo Mill Expansion is nearing completion, with commissioning expected to start next month and commercial production in the fourth quarter, keeping us on course for a record year, in Africa.Following our review of geotechnical assumptions at the Subika Underground mine, we are assessing mining methods for the low levels of that mine. As we conduct this review, we are mining more laterally and as a consequence have reduced our 2019 outlook by approximately 40,000 ounces.Looking forward, at Ahafo North, we continue to work through the permitting process, engaging with the relevant government agencies and building upon our relationships with traditional leaders and local communities.By putting it all together, we delivered 1.6 million ounces and all-in sustaining cost of approximately $1,000 per ounce in the second quarter. With our global and balanced portfolio, allowing us to overcome headwinds at select sites with continued solid execution across the rest of our operations.Turning to a review of our operational outlook on slide 12, our 2019 guidance includes a full year for the Newmont operations, including a full year for our Nevada sites and a partial year for the former Goldcorp operations, from April 18 to December 31.Now outlook has been updated, to include the impacts from the blockade at Peñasquito, the conveyor fire at Musselwhite, the installation of additional safety controls at Red Lake and the impacts from the slip in the Gold Quarry pit at Carlin in late 2018.2019 is second-half weighted as we ramp-up the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Borden projects and reach higher grades at Cerro Negro, Peñasquito and Éléonore.Sustaining capital of $985 million, includes investments in tailings storage facilities, expansions at Ahafo and Peñasquito, VLF2 leach pad expansion at CC&V in addition to infrastructure equipment and ongoing underground mine development throughout the portfolio.Development capital of $575 million includes payment in Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main, Borden and conveyor remediation works at Musselwhite. In summary, we expect to deliver 6.5 million ounces of gold, an all-in sustaining cost of $975 per ounce in our first partial year as a combined company. This operational outlook does not include any of the benefits that will flow from our Full Potential work at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro or from supply chain improvements where we are actively progressing work.Turning to slide 13 for a look into our early successes. We have made excellent progress in the first 90 days of integration. On the G&A front, we recently completed our organizational design work, to resize the Vancouver office from a corporate headquarters to a regional office. This work has already captured $40 million per annum in labor savings to date. We have realized a further $10 million per annum in non-labor G&A synergies through the consolidation of insurance and benefit programs real estate and other quick wins. We have commenced the next phase of this work, which shifts the focus from Vancouver to target duplication across the operating businesses.Turning to our supply chain work. Newmont's experienced supply chain team is actively chasing value across several fronts. Quick wins are being achieved through the extension of best pricing and rebates and we are also leveraging our increased scale and volume to seek improvements on some of the input costs.Our Full Potential program is well underway at Peñasquito recently kicked off at Cerro Negro and we're preparing to launch at Éléonore in the fourth quarter. At Peñasquito, Full Potential began in early June, and we have our key subject matter experts on the ground working with the site team focused on opportunities in the areas of mining, processing, asset management, G&A and external spend.Another example of applying our technical expertise to turn these former Goldcorp assets around is our strategic resource development program. This program lays the groundwork for future business plans of testing an extensive set of mine plan options across a wide range of interrelated variables.The output from this work ensures that we are pursuing the optimal development and value path for operations. At Musselwhite, our strategic resource team is working with the site to understand the entire value chain and review critical trade-offs in physicals financials and risks to develop the best value for that operation.In summary, our structured approach to delivering value heads us well on our way to achieve the cash flow improvements of $365 million per annum. We expect 40% of the improvements to be realized this year ramping up to 80% next year, and 100% by 2021.Looking further ahead at our project pipeline on slide 14. Another key value proposition in our combination with Goldcorp is our industry-leading project pipeline. Leveraging our project delivery track record it provides the opportunity to establish a foundation for steady production and cash flow for decades to come. This pipeline gives us significant flexibility and we will continue to advance only those projects that meet our minimum hurdle rate of 15% at a $1,200 gold price.As previously mentioned, we recently approved the Awonsu layback and this project is now shown in execution along with Musselwhite materials handling, and the three projects we expect to complete in the fourth quarter this year:Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main and Borden, it's also worth noting that we shifted the Coffee project from definitive feasibility to pre-feasibility as we take a step back to perform further exploration confirm the resource advance permitting activities and improve our understanding of the asset.As part of our integration and annual planning work, we will continue to evaluate all projects through our rigorous and disciplined investment system. I look forward to providing updates on our project portfolio as well as our optimization work on the six former Goldcorp assets to deliver long-term value as we move ahead.With that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on slide 15.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 16 for the financial highlights. Before we jump in, it's important to note that results reflect the performance of Goldcorp assets from April 18 until June 30. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion which increased 36% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from Goldcorp assets and higher realized gold prices; adjusted net income of $92 million or $0.12 per diluted share; and adjusted EBITDA of $679 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter.Cash from continuing operations was $301 million, a decrease of 25% driven by lower net income and higher accounts receivable at Boddington and Peñasquito with Peñasquito concentrate shipments recommencing in mid-June and port congestion at Boddington that delayed shipments near quarter end. Outstanding concentrate receivables at these two operations was more than $150 million, which we expect to collect in the third quarter. Those movements also contributed to a free cash flow decrease of approximately $220 million over the prior year quarter along with higher investments in development projects.We have collected $45 million of insurance proceeds related to the conveyor fire at Musselwhite of which $14 million was recorded as an offset to cost applicable to sales in the second quarter. As you will see in our detailed results, there are specific accounting and policy differences for the newly reported Goldcorp assets, including a reset in the basis of assets and liabilities to fair value and our changes to reporting for differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and the adoption of Newmont accounting policies.Some of these items include differences in the classification of certain investments as sustaining our development capital, the exclusion of resources and the calculation of depreciation expense and the impact on cost applicable to sales without deferred stripping costs. Other notable differences include coproduct accounting at Peñasquito, changes to the accounting for the mine's Silver Stream contract and the inclusion of Cerro Negro's Argentinian export tax in our AISC calculations.Turning to slide 17 for a review of earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $1 million. Primary adjustments included $0.16 comprised of $0.14 related to transaction and integration costs from the Goldcorp acquisition, such as severance payments, legal and banking fees and consulting costs; and $0.02 related to the Nevada joint venture transaction including cost related to defense; $0.04 related to reclamation and remediation charges at legacy Newmont sites; $0.05 related to a change in the fair value of equity investments; and $0.04 related to gains from the sale of exploration properties in North America. Taking these adjustments into account, we recorded adjusted net income of $0.12 per diluted share.I want to take a moment to thank the Newmont Goldcorp finance team and all the work they've accomplished to support the successful integration of the businesses in coordination with Barrick to successfully transfer ownership of our Nevada assets to the joint venture. As a reminder, our results for the third quarter will proportionately consolidate Newmont Goldcorp's ownership interest in Nevada gold mines for the terms of the joint venture agreement. We will present these results as a separate segment in our financial statements including the various elements of the P&L for disclosure purposes.Turning now to slide 18. We remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities including maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, investing in the next generation of mines to improve margins and build a stronger reserve base and return cash to shareholders. Newmont Goldcorp has one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, supported by a cash balance of $1.8 billion even after paying off $1.25 billion of outstanding Goldcorp debt at closing and returning approximately $590 million to shareholders in the second quarter.After the completion of several key financing activities in April, including a reset of our five-year $3 billion revolving credit facility and a successful exchange of Goldcorp notes, we maintain financial flexibility with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times. We also demonstrated our continued commitment to returns through a special dividend of $0.88 per share and a common dividend of $0.14 per share.Wrapping up with our 2019 corporate outlook on slide 19. We continue to invest in our future to secure the long-term stability of our business. For 2019, our support cost outlook is $325 million, which includes a portion of synergies from the Goldcorp combination, but also contemplates managing the Nevada operations from our Elko regional office through June 30. We are on track to deliver an annualized run rate of $85 million in G&A savings for 2020.Our interest expense is expected to be $280 million from our new debt profile and our depreciation and amortization outlook is just over $2 billion.Investment and exploration in advance projects is expected to be $450 million with near mine and greenfield exploration occurring across all regions and ongoing investments in advanced projects as we progress in the next phase of future growth. Finally, our consolidated adjusted tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 39% using a $1,200 gold price.Going forward, Newmont Goldcorp is well positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value creation.And now I'll hand it to Gary to wrap-up.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Nancy. Turning to Slide 21. Newmont Goldcorp delivered a strong first half in 2019. We are well-positioned to build on that performance in the second half and for decades to come.We will continue to focus on generating long-term value for our shareholders by executing our strategy which is to deliver superior operational excellence by focusing on safety and a culture of continuous improvement; sustain a global portfolio of long life assets by investing in the next generation of mines technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility by maintaining high standards and living up to expectations of how a leading business should operate.I'll end by saying thank you to our team and to our investors for your support. It has been an honor to lead Newmont Goldcorp. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together over the last seven years and I'm excited about the future for the business.I have great confidence in Tom and his new leadership team as he takes over the reins as CEO on October 1st and I have great confidence in this team's ability to build on a strong foundation and advance Newmont Goldcorp's position as the world's leading gold company.Thank you for your time. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Thanks. Good morning Gary, Nancy, Tom. It's been great working with you Gary. Best of luck in your new endeavors. I was just wondering with the new accounting Nancy that you spoke of how much of the lower earnings are related to that? The change in the loss of deferred stripping and the more conservative accounting. Have you thought about the impact that we've seen with these results as a result of the accounting?
Nancy Buese: Yes, thanks John. And absolutely that's something that we wanted to telegraph very early on because we knew there would be some significant differences. I would say the difference between IFRS and U.S. GAAP is probably the most material piece and we'd be happy to walk you through those in a bit more detail. And then certainly some changes between policies and as we've talked about the difference between development versus sustaining CapEx is probably the key piece of it as well as the co-product versus by-product accounting at Peñasquito.So, yes, that's probably a fairly material difference in the way you would have seen things reported at the Goldcorp level and we're very comfortable walking folks through the details of those to help make sure you're bridging to the way we'll be accounting for those going forward. But yes, our goal was not to surprise the market with that, but we've tried to telegraph that there would be some fairly material changes.
John Bridges: And then one of the things that seems a little bit counterintuitive is the switch from being able to depreciate underground mines against the reserves and resources. Now, I understand that just using reserves as per GAAP is a more conservative way of working, but it seems impractical particularly as you and other miners become more focused on underground mines. What's your thought on that? And would it be possible to lobby the SEC to change that?
Nancy Buese: Yes. Totally understand the request there and we don't disagree with you. However, we are settled a bit by the requirements of U.S. GAAP. so that might take more than just Newmont's desire to turn that around. But we totally understand the thoughts, but U.S. GAAP really requires us to only use reserve life to calculate depreciation.
John Bridges: Right. And then just if I may Subika, you mentioned that there's been a change in the mining plan there. What's going on?
Tom Palmer: John, it's Tom here. I'll pick that one up. As we look at some of the ongoing work and looking at some of the stresses as you move into the depths deeper into that mine, we're seeing higher stresses. So we're taking a step back to look at our mining method particularly the type of backfill we might need for that. So as we step back and understand that we've just moved out of mining laterally, so we can work through that mining plan -- mine planning process through the course of the business planning process this year. So, I'd expect as we move through to provide our longer-term guidance at the latter part of this year that we can provide more insight into that. But it's how we've managed higher stresses in that mine as we move into some of the deeper parts of it.
John Bridges: Okay. Great. Thanks. Best of luck Tom in the new role and best of luck Gary and others. Thank you.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Hi Gary, Tom and Nancy and all the best for you Gary and Tom in your new role. A couple of questions from me. Just starting on the new guidance, the 6.5 million ounces for 2019 taking into account the -- from April on the Goldcorp assets. How do we think about that number you provided in the context of the ongoing Full Potential program from here and as you transition into 2020 and moving forward? Is that a number you've largely reset as such and then you'll build from that with any optimization on Full Potential? Or can we still think about 2020 and beyond as still pretty fluid depending on the outcomes of your review of the assets in the coming six months? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris. Tom here, I'll pick that one up. Look, the approach that we take with all of our operations and the Full Potential approach we take in coming in and running full potential at those operations is to start with previous best demonstrated performance and understand what you've done in the past and then building a plan on that basis that's underpinned by a robust resource model is then feeding a mine plan.And then we start to build some stretch in that in terms of the improvement. That's the starting point that Full Potential has as it comes into Peñasquito and Cerro Negro and Éléonore as well as our existing or former Newmont operations. So that's the basis at which we have worked with our 14 operations to develop our guidance for this year and that's the process that we're using to build our business plans for 2020 and beyond for Newmont Goldcorp.What we do with full potential is when we have a Full Potential Program we go through a diagnosis phase and then a development phase. Coming out of a development phase, you then have a series of projects that have clear value delivery linked to them, resources and accountabilities and a time frame. It's only when we have those clearly defined projects in place that we build them into our plans and our guidance.So as I said in my comments, you won't see Full Potential benefits built into our 2019 guidance because that work is only just starting at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro. We would expect to see some of those benefits for those two sites flowing into our 2020 business plan and our 2020 numbers. So we're very disciplined and rigorous in the way we look at our mine plans and the way we apply our Full Potential Program.
Chris Terry: Okay. Thanks Tom. And then just thinking about the medium term, so should we expect our updated guidance on forward years from late this -- later this year? And what's the sort of updated timing on any divestments in that prior sort of 6 million to 7 million ounce range that you talked about in the last quarter? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris. I'll pick up the first part of your question and pass it across to Gary for the second part. We're right in the middle of our normal annual business planning process at the moment. That's the standard process we run through as we walk through that process and present our business plan to our board in the latter part of this year for approval. We'll then follow-up with longer-term guidance and we're currently targeting our standard time frame of December to be sharing that with you.
Gary Goldberg: And just to follow-up on the divestment question. Just a reminder there was no need to do any divestments as part of this acquisition and the whole process that we've gone as we work with Barrick to support and develop the Nevada joint venture.So we want to make sure we get in, get a good look at all the operations and projects that we brought in with the Goldcorp acquisition to make sure as we did with Newmont five years ago -- or five to six years ago in terms of going through all the assets to make sure they're delivery as strongly and as well as possible before we move forward with that process. So that's where we're focused.
Chris Terry: Thanks Gary. And the last one from me, just on a couple of assets specifically, on Musselwhite and pushing out the timeline on the repair work there. Should we assume that that can ramp up pretty quickly in 2020? Or is it too early to say what the impact might be on that year? And then for Peñasquito specifically as well, did the blockade have -- I was just wondering if you could go through a few more details on the impact that that had on perhaps mining inventory levels, other factors around the mine as well just to think about the second half and going forward? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Chris, Tom again I'll pick both those up. So at Musselwhite, the fire damaged the full 2.5-kilometer conveying systems. So it's a process of rehabbing say after removal the damaged structure and rehab the ground control, a 2.5 kilometer decline. We are well advanced 70% complete on that rehab work.I was at Musselwhite a few weeks ago. I will just say that's work in progress and they're doing an excellent job in terms of ensuring that they're setting up that rehab for the long-term in a mine that has a very long life.We're right in the throes now of assessing bids for the fabrication installation of a new conveyor. So ultimately our timing will be determined by those bids coming in, so we'll gain greater understanding of that in the coming weeks. It will be in the 2020 though before that conveyor system commissioned and up and running.We are back in working on the materials handling project. That project was well advanced when it was paused because of the fire, so it's -- we're very much getting the final stage of that project and we'll be moving through, commissioning in the latter part of this year and having it ready and available in the New Year as that conveying system comes up.Our focus at Musselwhite is to ensure that there is the appropriate level of development work that we have the appropriate number of stopes open and then we have the drifts out to do the exploration work to map out the future of that mine, so that when we have that conveying system up and running we have the appropriate number of open stopes and the ability to be able to maintain the appropriate number of open stopes going forward.So I fully expect that when that mine comes back up, when that conveying system comes back up, it will come up very smoothly and we'll be able to hit our -- whatever the appropriate rate is out of that mine very smoothly and quickly.In terms of Peñasquito, as a result of that blockade there were no impacts on the operation itself. It was managed in a -- very appropriately in a care and maintenance situation and we did a lot of maintenance work through that downtime period. It also has ramped up very smoothly. We have been able to move -- concentrate to market very effectively, although as Nancy indicated both Peñasquito and Boddington have a little backlog of concentrate sales from the second quarter that will flow into the third quarter.The concentrate inventory levels by now are back to normal. The mine is running well. The plant is running well. The impact on the second half of this year will still move in the higher grades for gold, silver and lead. Grade stay about the same for zinc. As a result of the 50-day shutdown, we'll see some of those higher grades that we're expecting in the fourth quarter to move into 2020 and so we'll see that in our 2020 guidance as we bring that out later in the year.
Chris Terry: Thanks Tom. That’s all for me. All the best to you and Gary. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the Goldcorp synergies for a second. Can you clarify the cadence of the synergies? I thought, I heard you say 40% this year, 80% next year and 100% by 2021. And if that's the case this year, is it right to say that none of that 40% of the $365 million would be full potential? It's all coming from G&A and supply chain? Just some clarity around that would be helpful.
Tom Palmer: Tom again I'll pick that one up. You're pretty much spot on. So a lot of the early quick wins from G&A, which we're seeing now and we’re still more to pursue as we move from Vancouver out to the operating sites. There's the quick wins that come from supply chain in terms of rebates extensions for the Goldcorp -- equipping the Goldcorp site. So you just see quick wins in supply chain and G&A, with G&A being the lion's share of that 40% this year.You'll then start to see next year both supply chain improvements in full potential flow, as we start to deliver on improvement projects at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro. And then as we move through the other Goldcorp assets through the course of next year, you'll start to see the remainder of that flow, primarily from full potential with some additional supply chain. So G&A, some supply chain, Full Potential really kicking in in 2020-2021.
Fahad Tariq: That's helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, any surprises or anything interesting you've learned so far from the Full Potential work at Peñasquito and Cerro Negro? Anything that has been different than, perhaps your initial assumptions when you first did the due diligence on the mines? Thanks.
Tom Palmer: No surprises from our due diligence. There is everything that I expect to say that we are seeing, and I think there's the real the value proposition of Newmont's operating model sitting and having these six Goldcorp assets come into our operating model, and seeing the journey that we've been on places like Boddington and Tanami applied to operations like Peñasquito and Cerro Negro absolutely have water, and there's nothing's changed in my mind in terms of what we saw during due diligence and what we've seen over the first 90 days of running these operations. There's a need for technical rigor and discipline. We bring that. We've got key technical expertise. We're seeing some real opportunities in the full potential space.I think in Peñasquito, and I'm heading down there this afternoon, particularly the interface between the mind and the mill, which we see and have continued to pursue at Boddington. We see the real opportunities there at Peñasquito. And Cerro Negro is going to be really focused around mining and development rights underground. There's a real opportunity there. We believe we have the skills and expertise to bring the improvements in that space at Cerro Negro, so no surprises at all.
Fahad Tariq: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Thank you. Tom, just listening to what you're saying about the development at Musselwhite and have the folks there just to get that ahead of what you have been I suppose. Is that a continuing theme you're seeing across the Goldcorp operation, that just wasn't the development work done or stripping required to meet the needs of the mills? Is that the biggest problem in your mind?
Tom Palmer: To be frank Greg, yes. There was not the work done on exploration. There wasn't the work done on development, and that's absolutely fundamental in either open pit or underground mine. So, as we look at Musselwhite, Musselwhite had one stope open before the fire. That's unacceptable. We will not have...
Greg Barnes: Now, how many would it need, Tom?
Tom Palmer: It depends. We have to do our work on understanding the value, but you'd expect the mine the size of Musselwhite with the size of their stopes to have, five or six stopes open at any one time. So, before we recommission that conveying system, we expect to have the development work done to not only have six stopes ready to go, but the stopes have come beyond those and the exploration drifts to be beyond those too.I mean that's a real -- I mean, Musselwhite is our Tanami in Canada. So we need to be out in front of the mining work to be doing the exploration work to be mapping out that future potential of that operation. So that's -- our focus is now that we've got secondary egress is to be in there doing the development work, so that when the conveying system is ready, we can maintain the appropriate level of throughput through that mine, but also be doing the work to understand its future life.
Greg Barnes: So was that similar lack of development of Cerro Negro and Éléonore as well?
Tom Palmer: It's a similar thing. The thing we saw through our due diligence was the opportunity for us to come in and apply our rigor and discipline and operating model to those operations.
Greg Barnes: How long Tom, do you think it's going to take you to get these operations to where you want them to be?
Tom Palmer: Again as we talk about, as we marketed this transaction, there is 24 months, possibly at the 36 months for some of those operations to really get them to the level of performance that we would expect. It's a very similar journey. If you look back over Newmont over the last six or seven years, and we're at Boddington or at Tanami was back in 2012 or 2013 to where it is today, there's a good two, three years of work to get those operations set up for sustainable long-term value delivery.
Greg Barnes: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury: Hi. Good morning. Just got a question on Cerro Negro and Éléonore. Cerro Negro I think that tonnes throughput in the quarter is around 3,400 tonnes. I know Goldcorp was pushing 4,000 tonnes. And I think you've talked in the past about maybe that was too aggressive. And I'm just wondering should we assume a run rate similar to Q2? Or sort of what throughput expectations should we expect over the balance of the year and similarly on Éléonore?
Tom Palmer: Thanks Carey. So you won't hear us talk about tonnes per day out of the former Goldcorp operations. You'll hear us talk about – it might be tonnes per year, but you'll certainly hear us talk about what's the highest value or the best value out of those operations. In terms of the Cerro Negro, we are moving into a couple of higher-grade zones in – so you'd expect to see both higher grade and increased volume coming out of those underground mines in the second half, which is going to contribute to a back-half-weighted Cerro Negro for 2019. Similarly, for Éléonore you are moving into some higher-grade areas of Horizon five or six that will help back-half weight Eléonore for this year.
Carey MacRury: So should we assume that the rate of – before going into the mill will be more variable going forward or –
Tom Palmer: No, you'd expect the right going through the mill to be consistent going forward. But what we'll be focused on is what's the combination of buying a mill that's going to deliver the best value for those operations that will be a change in language you can expect to hear from Newmont Goldcorp.
Carey MacRury: And again for the balance of the year is that going to be similar to Q2 or is it going to be different in Q2? Obviously, you've mentioned higher grades in the back half.
Tom Palmer: Yes. Essentially one thing to remember second quarter didn't start with all these Goldcorp assets. We didn't start accounting for them until April 18. So that wasn't a full three months of production so keep that in mind when you look at the numbers.
Carey MacRury: Okay. And then maybe one other question on 2019 clearly there's a lot of issues this year with the Peñasquito and Musselwhite fire. I think your previous pro forma guidance for 2020, 2021 is 7.4 million to 7.5 million ounces. Is there anything that you've seen so far that you think those numbers would change materially? Or more or less do you think you can still get to those certain numbers again barring any improvements from the full potential?
Tom Palmer: Carey, we're right in the middle of our planning process at the moment. And as I talked earlier in terms of – we stepped back and ensure, we understand the resource model that's underpinning mine plans to resource risk, the investment in exploration we need to do to be managing our resource risk and then building mine plans off the back of operating assumptions that are based on previous best demonstrated performance and then have improvement built into those. So we're going back to those technical fundamentals for all 14 operations across Newmont Goldcorp. And as we're building those production profiles and then starting to move into the cost and so on and so forth, we're seeing production profiles consistent with what we expect to come into this transaction.
Carey MacRury: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Good morning, everybody. I think that's me. Just wanted to – I have to shorten my name. I just wanted to – Gary first of all good luck to you on your next adventure. It was really great working with you. All the best. Just on a few things from myself. Maybe Tom just coming back to Ahafo just on the Subika Underground appreciate your talking that you see additional more stresses than you were expecting as you go deeper. Can you just let us know is this just in a certain portion of the ore body that this is occurring why you will have to adjust? Or is there is a general for the whole ore body?
Tom Palmer: It's for the Subika ore body, Subika Underground ore body. It is a general increase in stress as you move through depth. So it's then stepping back and saying what's the mining method that best suits that stress condition and what's – and associated that what's the appropriate backfill? So as we step back and look at that we are starting to look like a mining method that might be more bulk top mining, which ultimately I think as we're working our way through that has the opportunity to extend the life of Subika Underground because it will give us access to more ore.So, it's about working through understanding that stress mining method. And then looking at the upside opportunity of that changing mining method. But it's generally as you move, a depth metal body is seeing higher stresses. And therefore we have to think about how we -- what's the best mining method to match those.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And when will that work be done by?
Tom Palmer: We're doing that work now. It's being built into our business plans for this year and going forward. So, we would expect to see that incorporated into our long-term guidance, so that we'll come out with it in December.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then just on -- so that was the change in Ahafo guidance that we saw from your previous guidance. And is it safe to assume all of the change in the Nevada guidance was a Gold Quarry adjustment?
Tom Palmer: That's correct. So you saw at Ahafo, we're mining laterally rather than heading down. So that's the impact there.
Tanya Jakusconek: Yeah.
Tom Palmer: And yes, that's the 70,000 ounces that we've been indicating from the Gold Quarry impact from the slip last year is. What you're seeing as take up in that guidance for our Nevada our assets that we just issued.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then maybe just on -- coming back on the Goldcorp assets, clearly your statement on the fact that, there's lack of underground development to sustain these assets at these -- longer term and just have to catch up.So Tom, if this is the case how confident, are you on the guidance that you gave us for 2019? Like, do we have enough development to meet the guidance numbers you put out?
Tom Palmer: Yes we do. And I'm very confident in the guidance numbers we've put out. We have applied Newmont rigor to arrive with those numbers. And I'm very confident in those numbers.
Tanya Jakusconek: That goes to underground operations?
Tom Palmer: Yes.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay.
Tom Palmer: So, in some instances, 10-year, the development's there for now. But i.e. but at Tanami, we have great control drilling out three years in front of us with a 10-year life out in front of us. That's the expectation that I have for these Goldcorp assets as well.So it's -- some -- the example I gave at Musselwhite is here now. And there are other examples where we need to make sure, we're managing these assets for the long-term.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So meeting the 6,600 tonnes a day at Éléonore 4,000 at Cerro Negro you have the stopes you need to make that for this year?
Tom Palmer: We have development work required to meet our production guidance for this year out of those former Goldcorp assets.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then maybe on Peñasquito, just on the open pit, you said it ramped up nicely. Is it grade -- are you seeing improvement in grade in the Q3 in the month of July? Are you starting to see that?
Tom Palmer: You will start to see improvement in grade across gold, silver and lead coming through. Yes. We're seeing it in the third quarter. And then you'll see it kick up more in the fourth quarter. So as you're going to see more of that in the fourth quarter than the third. But yes we are seeing that coming through from that mine as expected.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So no surprises right now for Peñasquito? I'm sorry. I didn't ask on the throughput. Is the throughput back to 110,000 tonnes a day?
Tom Palmer: We'll have the throughput to deliver our guidance for 2019.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Okay, look forward to seeing that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. And just in terms of the capital guidance, I think you've talked about it a bit. But I was just trying to figure out, how do I think about 2020 given the guidance that you have for this year?So, I guess my first question was -- and would someone address that -- with Goldcorp undercapitalizing. But it sounds like there needs to be a catch-up in capital. So, if I was looking at this would it be fair to just basically annualize the numbers that you put out given that this is about three quarters of the year for the Goldcorp assets for 2019?
Tom Palmer: Anita, Tom here. So that's a fair assumption.
Anita Soni: All right, and then, just moving on to Cerro, so then Cerro Negro would be -- given that it's sort of an $80 million -- I'm sorry not $80, $70 million going forward. For three quarters of the year we're looking at $100 million per ounce at Cerro Negro, between development and sustaining capital?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah. I think Anita, at this point in time that's a good estimate to make. As I say, we're right in the middle of our planning process at the moment. So, we'll be able to give you better guidance on that when we have our numbers later in the year. But for now, I think that's appropriate.
Anita Soni: Sure. And then maybe, Nancy, you can give me some clarity on the demarcation between development capital and sustaining capital? I understand Goldcorp was not as conservative as you guys are, but I'm just trying to understand what the $40 million in development capital at Éléonore is related to. I mean is that just catching up you're calling that catching up on underground development work is that what it is?
Nancy Buese: Anita, I don't have the details on that specifics, but I will double-check on that for you. I think it's really as you captured it it's a more conservative view from Newmont's view and things that we would consider sustaining CapEx versus development.
Anita Soni: I'm just trying to understand where you still draw the line though at that development capital. Is it -- I mean historically people would think of development capital as growth-related capital and it doesn't sound like you guys are forecasting any growth for Goldcorp assets?
Nancy Buese: Right. So again it's a policy difference and we would be more conservative in that view. And it would take under our definition of development capital we'll probably have a bit more in terms of our hurdle to get through before we would call it that. So I think that's really the biggest difference. And again we can walk you through some of the details of that offline if that's helpful.
Tom Palmer: As an example – Anita, Tom here. You do have in that development capital number for this year the material handling system at Musselwhite. Sorry…
Anita Soni: Yes. And I understand – related to Borden -- Porcupine is probably related to Borden. I guess the Musselwhite, I'm just trying to understand the Éléonore and Cerro Negro or presumably there's been a lot of growth coming down the pipe or there's no real big projects happening it's just a matter of catching up on sustaining.So just moving on to Peñasquito. And maybe you can help me out with this offline, but it does look like you already had pretty good grades going into this quarter. Throughput was obviously low and recoveries were obviously low. And I was just trying to understand on the recovery side of the equation are you confident with PLP in the guidance that they had put -- that Goldcorp put out for about 80% recovery rates coming out of gold in the PLP circuit considering that it only did 57 this quarter? I mean how much of that was related to the shutdown and how much was a rebound?
Tom Palmer: Yes, Anita I wouldn't look at the numbers out of this quarter for those few days and draw any conclusions because in commissioning the facility brings some lower-grade material higher carbon material through that so -- to get it back up and running again. So a key part of my visit down -- heading down there this afternoon is just to understand how that whole circuit is performing including PLP and that they've got the plans in place to deliver on their commitments for production this year from all circuits in the processing plant at Peñasquito including PLP.
Anita Soni: Okay. And I mean the grade already in the quarter though was I think was decent, I'm just kind of struggling through the ounce -- the change between ounces and short ton and your methodology. But it does look like it's around 0.8 gram per ton material in the historical sense of the way Goldcorp reported it. So just I'm just wondering why you decided to put higher-grade material through the mill and the recoveries were low.
Tom Palmer: Yes, I wouldn't look at a few days' operation this quarter and draw any conclusions. It was really ramping up facilities. So it's -- even now where only a couple of weeks even with the big processing plant layback a couple of weeks into July. I'm glad things settled down and so how the Q3 numbers look like.
Anita Soni: All right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for closing remarks.
Gary Goldberg: Newmont Goldcorp delivered solid second quarter results. And we will look forward to an even stronger second half as we continue to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in Newmont Goldcorp.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmontgoldcorp.com. Now, I'll hand it over to Gary on Slide 3.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Jess, and thank you all, for joining our call. Newmont delivered solid first quarter results as we continue to execute our strategy which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mine safely and efficiently, sustaining a global portfolio of long life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on four continents and leading the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. Turning to the details on Slide 4; in the first quarter, Newmont again delivered superior operational execution which we demonstrated by producing over 1.2 million ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining cost of $907 per ounce. Pouring our 10 millionth ounce at Tanami since mining began in 1986 and forging an agreement with Barrick to create a joint venture in Nevada by combining our operations to unlock synergies and new opportunities for our employees and stakeholders. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We commissioned the Tanami power project safely and on-schedule, lowering power cost and carbon emissions by 20% and paving the way for a second expansion of this world-class asset in Australia. We invested in profitable growth through the Ahafo mill expansion and Quecher Main projects, which are expected to reach commercial production later this year. We progressed studies for future opportunities across our portfolio including Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides which continue to advance towards full-funding decisions. And we announced and last week closed our acquisition of Goldcorp, which I'll discuss in more detail later. Finally, we delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $687 million and free cash flow of $349 million, maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, supported by an investment-grade credit profile, returning cash to shareholders through an industry leading quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and a special dividend of $0.88 per share. We also continued to fulfill our commitments to leading environmental, social and governance performance by upholding human rights, serving as a responsible natural resource stewards and applying lessons to reduce risks and improve health and safety for the benefit of all employees and stakeholders. I invite you to read more about our performance, programs and targets as well as areas we can continue to improve on and beyond the mine, our annual sustainability report which is available on our website. Turning to more about sustainability on Slide 5. We began the year with the total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.52, a step back from our 2018 performance and a reminder that we need to remain vigilant in reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors throughout our business. Earlier this month mark the anniversary of the tragic loss of our six colleagues at the Ahafo Mill Expansion Project in Ghana. Although a year has passed, the void in the lives of their families and friends remain as their memories live on. We learned critical lessons from the thorough investigation conducted after the accident. These lessons have been applied at our operations and have been shared across the mining industry. Creating a more responsible and sustainable business is a continuous journey. The tragic failure of Vale's Brumadinho tailings facility in Brazil earlier this year highlighted the need for the industry to improve its management of these facilities. Newmont continues to review and improve our existing practices. To improve awareness of our facilities, we published a tailings fact sheet which can be found on our website. We have 26 tailings facilities in which we safely place more than 100 million tons of tailings every year, guided by strict standards for managing and expecting our facilities. We also actively support raising standards for tailings management across the mining industry, similar to how we've been able to raise our standards on cyanide management. We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of people and the environment. Turning to Slide 6. In January, we announced our intent to combine with Goldcorp and just last week, we closed the transaction after receiving all the regulatory and shareholder approvals. Newmont Goldcorp is the world's leading gold business with the strongest portfolio of operating gold mines, projects and reserves in favorable mining jurisdictions. Underpinned by a proven and scalable operating model, we'll target six to seven million ounces per year sustainable gold production and we expect to enhance annual revenues by another $1.5 billion through silver, zinc and copper production. We will have the financial flexibility needed to execute our capital priorities, delivering industry-leading dividend and maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. We have a deep bench of accomplished business leaders and high performing technical teams with extensive mining industry experience and we will maintain industry-leadership in environmental, social and governance performance. Beyond great assets, prospects and people, our value proposition is supported by our proven strategy and track record. We expect to generate $365 million in annual pre-tax savings through G&A synergies, supply chain efficiencies and full potential improvements. Taken together, these efforts hold the potential to deliver total value creation of $4.4 billion. We also expect to unlock further upside through portfolio optimization, project sequencing, exploration and divestments. As a result, Newmont Goldcorp is set to deliver stable-free cash flow from steady production and improving cost over a decade-long time horizon. Turning to our global portfolio on Slide 7. Newmont Goldcorp's industry-leading portfolio is based in four regions where we have the stability and proven operating model to create value. With the additional assets in Canada, Argentina and Mexico, and the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, we now have the strongest portfolio of operating mines in favorable jurisdictions, with 90% of the reserves based in the Americas and Australia. Turning to our projects on Slide 8. Newmont Goldcorp has a robust project pipeline, creating a foundation for steady production and cash flow for decades to come. This pipeline gives us significant flexibility and we will continue to advance only those projects that meet our minimum hurdle rate of 15% at a $1,200 gold price. The depth of this pipeline also allows us to optimize and sequence projects to ensure that capital is deployed effectively and efficiently based on value and risk. This is the same approach we have taken to successfully deliver 11 projects on four continents on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget over the last six years. Turning to our production profile on Slide 9. Here is a look at Newmont Goldcorp's production through 2025. We are well-positioned for the longer term and over the next seven years, the combined portfolio is capable of producing seven to eight million ounces of gold annually, with all-in sustaining cost declining from $945 per ounce in 2019, to $830 per ounce in 2025. I would emphasize that we are still targeting production of six to seven million ounces of gold annually and this outlook did not include the impact of potential divestitures or project optimization. Turning to the Nevada joint venture on Slide 10. In March, we entered into an implementation agreement with Barrick to form a joint venture that will combine our mining operations, assets, reserves and talent in Nevada. We believe this arrangement will generate long term value for all of our stakeholders by unlocking synergies, allowing profitable production to continue well into the future and creating opportunities for employees and other stakeholders through our broader unified mining enterprise in Nevada. Under the terms of the agreement, Barrick and Newmont Goldcorp will hold economic interests equal to 61.5% and 38.5% respectively. Barrick will operate the entity with overall management responsibility and will be subject to the supervision and direction of the joint venture's board which will be comprised of three individuals appointed by Barrick, along with Tom Palmer and myself. Electively, both companies will have equal representation on the joint venture's technical, financial and exploration advisory committees. Our teams have been meeting regularly to facilitate a smooth transition upon closing and ensure a successful partnership into the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our financial performance.
Nancy Buese: Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 12 for the financial highlights. Compared to the prior year quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.8 billion, which was approximately flat despite lower gold price. Adjusted net income of $176 million or $0.33 per diluted share. An adjusted EBITDA of $687 million, an increase of 7%. Cash from continuing operations was $574 million and free cash flow is $349 million, primarily due to improvements in working capital. Turning to Slide 13 for our review of earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $113 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included $0.11 related to transaction and integration cost from the Goldcorp acquisition and the Nevada joint venture. $0.04 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.03 primarily related to a change in the fair value of our investments and minor restructuring charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. Turning now to Slide 14. We remain well-positioned to execute our capital priorities including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of mines to improve margins and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Newmont closed the first quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector and over the past month, we've executed a number of key financing activities. We declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share and announced a special dividend of $0.88 per share. The special dividend will be paid on May 1 to Newmont shareholders on record as of April 17. We reset our five-year $3 billion revolving credit facility, creating a strong banking syndicate and providing for a solid slate of future financing partners. We completed a successful exchange of Goldcorp notes to Newmont and streamlined our capital structure, and we paid off $1.25 billion of outstanding Goldcorp debt at closing. Looking forward, 2019 will involve some complex reporting updates as we work to integrate Goldcorp and close the Nevada joint venture. In the second quarter, we will report consolidated Newmont Goldcorp financial results which will include Goldcorp's performance from the date of close. However, it's worth noting the guidance we provided in March assumed a full-year of Goldcorp production, costs and capital. Impacts from the Nevada joint venture have yet to be fully determined, but once the transaction is completed, we will fortunately consolidate our ownership interests and report the entity as a separate segment in our financials. Despite the reporting changes you will see in 2019, Newmont Goldcorp is well-positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long term value creation. And now I'll hand it to Tom for the discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Nancy. Turning to North America on Slide 16. Our North American operations turned in a solid quarter. After coming off a very strong fourth quarter and overcoming near term challenges. At Carlin, we delivered steady performance and continued our remediation work at Gold Quarry. As previously stated, we forecast the impact of geotechnical issues on Carlin's production to be approximately 70,000 ounces in 2019. However, we expect to recover proportion of these ounces over the medium term and we plan to start mining Chukar underground at Gold Quarry again in June. During the second quarter, Mill #6 will complete its annual planned maintenance shut for approximately three weeks in May. At CC&V, we completed a drawdown of stockpile concentrates for processing in Nevada and the running at more steady state production and inventory levels. And at Phoenix, we started to shift in the higher grade copper zones and away from higher grade gold zones in our mine sequence. Looking forward, we remain focused on continued execution and finalizing the Nevada joint venture with Barrick as we begin to generate additional value through combining our assets. We are also advancing our studies of CC&V underground and Galore Creek. Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Yanacocha, we continued mining higher grades from Tapado Oeste pit. And at Merian, first quarter performance was impacted by wet weather, but continued improvements in mine and mill productivity helped to offset this. We have reached fresh rock and although we expect variability in the amount of saprolite we process, the primary crusher will help to sustain mill throughput over the course of 2019. Quecher Main stripping continues on cause and the destruction of the leach pad is ongoing as we target commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019. Once complete, Yanacocha is expected to deliver approximately 200,000 ounces per year of consolidated production from 2020 to 2025 and serve as a bridge to developing the extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. Detailed engineering work for the sulfide project continues and in March we achieved a significant milestone, the approval of the overall projects environmental impact assessment. Two subsequent approvals will be required prior to reaching a full funds decision in 2020. Turning to Australia on Slide 18. At Tanami, we delivered strong performance on the back of higher grades and sustained mill improvements. As Gary mentioned, Tanami reached an impressive milestone in March and I'd like to congratulate the team for pouring the operations' 10 millionth ounce. At Boddington, stripping in the south pit continues and we successfully completed the first of three planned mill maintenance shuts in 2019. KCGM continues to manage geotechnical challenges whilst we draw down stockpiles to help offset, reduced ex-pit [ph] mining. Mining in the Morrison starter pit is under way and we expect to reach higher grades in the second half of the year, helping to sustain operations as we work to optimize our longer term mine plans that will continue through the most of 2019. Looking forward, study work for Tanami Expansion 2 continues to advance towards a full funds decision later this year and shard [ph] sinking has progressed beyond 90 meters. Turning to our latest investment on Slide 19. In March, the Tanami power project was commissioned safely and on schedule. The project included the installation of a 450-kilometer natural gas pipeline, two power stations and an interconnected power line. Transitioning the site from diesel to natural gas provides a reliable energy source, lowering power cost and carbon emissions by 20% while paving the way to further extend Tanami's mine life. And the project is expected to generate net cash savings of $34 per ounce in 2019 to 2023 and deliver an internal rate of return of greater than 50%. Tanami is Australia's second largest underground gold mine and we expect it to remain a cornerstone asset in the Newmont Goldcorp portfolio for decades to come. Turning to Africa on Slide 20. The African region yet again delivered another strong quarter. At a time [ph], the mill continues to perform well on the back of sustained full potential improvements. And in the Ahafo, improved performance was driven by higher grades from both the Subika underground and open pit. The Ahafo mill expansion remains on-track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter and once completed will increase production, lower costs and extend mine life at Ahafo. We are reaching the peak construction work for some site and remain focused on safely completing the construction, the stockpile feed conveyor, SAG mill, primary crusher and ledge tanks. In the second quarter, we expect to make a full funds decision for the ones that are laidback [ph], an extension of the current mining operations that will take open pit mine life at Ahafo through to 2029. Ahafo's performance is expected to continue improving throughout 2019 and now remain on track to deliver a record year. Finally, we continue to advance our original growth studies and are working to prioritize our many opportunities on a value versus risk basis. Turning to Slide 21 for an update on the Goldcorp assets and our integration work. During the first quarter, Goldcorp operations performed as expected. With the board on [ph] project at Porcupine on schedule to achieve commercial production in the second half of 2019 and the Pyrite Leach Project running well with overall recoveries trending high in Peñasquito. And at Red Lake, the Cochenour Project achieved commercial production on April 1 and is expected to contribute approximately 30,000 ounces in 2019. We expect the back half way to 2019 for the Goldcorp assets driven by rich in higher grades of both Peñasquito and Cerra Negro. However, recent events have created headwinds to achieving Goldcorp's previously forecasted production levels. At Musselwhite, our team is conducting a thorough investigation into the conveyor fire which occurred on March 29. We are also working to establish full access to the mine which is expected to occur over the next two months. As a result, the materials' handling project work is currently suspended and we'll provide additional updates on project timing and impacts to production as information becomes available. At Peñasquito, we're engaged in active dialog to successfully resolve an ongoing partial blockade of the site by group of local stakeholders. During this process, the site has maintained planned production levels through the mill and we expect minimal impacts to 2019 production, but overall mining rates have been reduced. Turning to our integration efforts which are well under way. In March, we announced Newmont Goldcorp's executive leadership team, featuring accomplished mining leaders who are appointed based on a number of criteria including experience, team performance and values by its leadership. Most of the changes will take place over the coming months to allow for seamless transition process through the fourth quarter and I'll succeed Gary as President and Chief Executive Officer. Rob Atkinson will join us on June 1 as Chief Operating Officer, leading our operations and projects team which includes our four Regional Senior Vice Presidents. These four individuals were appointed based on their exceptional track records of leadership, project execution and commitment to safety and sustainability. Todd White have previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Goldcorp will lead Newmont Goldcorp's new North America region with accountability for our four mines in Canada, CC&V in the U.S. and Peñasquito Mexico. After three years successfully leading our Africa region, Alwyn Pretorius will move across to lead our South America region with accountability for the Cerro Negro, Merian and Yanacocha operations. Ramzi Fawaz who is a 16-year veteran with Newmont and led the very successful turnaround of the Tanami mine in Australia from 2012 to 2019 and is currently leading our project development work in Australia has been promoted to replace Alwyn as Regional Senior Vice President of our Africa region, with accountability for Ahafo and [indiscernible] operations. And finally, Alex Bates, the Regional Senior Vice President of our Australia region was overseeing improvements are our Tanami, Boddington and KCGM operations will continue in his current capacity. Now that we have appointed all of the senior leaders, the next step will be to launch our Full Potential continuous improvement program at our newly acquired Goldcorp assets. Starting at Peñasquito in June and progressing to Sierra Negro and progressing to Cerro Negro and Éléonore over the second half of 2019. Full Potential will have a laser focus on the key value drivers for each location. However, we expect the greatest overall value potential to be in processing improvements which will concentrate on productivity, reliability and cost efficiency. Our teams have been working diligently to begin delivering G&A savings or removing duplicationin the areas of labor and consulting services and we're also pursuing near-term supply chain efficiencies which include the initial consolidation of supply contracts and utilizing our scale to improve global purchasing power. I'm very excited to have Newmont Goldcorp leadership team in place with highly capable people focused on generating long term value. With that, I'll hand it back to Gary to wrap up on Slide 22.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 23, Newmont delivered solid first quarter results and laid the ground work for an even stronger future for Newmont Goldcorp. Our focus remains on generating long term value for our shareholders. We will do this by continuing to execute our strategy, which is to deliver superior operational excellence by focusing on safety and the culture of continuous improvement, sustain a global portfolio of long life assets by investing in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business, and to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility by maintaining high standards and respectful relationships with all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Fahad Tariq: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On Slide 21, you talked a little bit about Goldcorp. Because we don't have any operational results from Q1, can you give some more color on specifically Musselwhite with the underground fire and Cerra Negro, with the strike, how that impacted Q1 on production? And any other color you can give on Q1, that would be really helpful.
Tom Palmer: It's Tom here. For Peñasquito, that hasn't had any impact on any Q1 production. We've been able to continue to run the mill as we work through that matter and the fire at Musselwhite occurred at the very end of the first quarter. It's still a fairly recent event that we're working through to understand what breadth [ph] is to come back in and remediate the areas that were damaged by the fire and do the rectification work, so it's still very early days there. But from a Q1 perspective, neither of those issues have an impact on Goldcorp's performance.
Fahad Tariq: Okay, thank you.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Fahad.
Operator: The next question will come from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: Hi, Gary, Tom, and Nancy. Few questions from me. The first one, just around the integration of the Goldcorp assets, how do you think about getting the right speed there where you can make changes but not I guess be too hasty? Will you start making changes at the asset level before giving the overall guidance? And then what is the timing that we should expect where you come out with revised estimates for the total company including the new Goldcorp assets? Thanks. That's my first question.
Gary Goldberg: I'll take the last question and then I'll hand the first question back over to Tom. In terms of guidance, the plan would be when we announced our second quarter results in July, we'd update the Newmont Goldcorp guidance. As a reminder, that wouldn't include changes that might be impacting guidance from the Nevada JV that we'll pick on board once that gets established moving forward. In terms of integration, a lot of work going on on the integration front and has been now for well over two months. And I'll hand over to Tom on the details of the work that's going on there.
Tom Palmer: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, Chris. The six Goldcorp assets, in effect there's no change for those successes. The six general managers remain in place, will have father those assets report through to Todd White as our new North American Regional Senior Vice President, Tera Negar [ph] report through to Alwyn Pretorius, our new South America Regional Senior Vice President. But we expect those operations to continue to run under the leadership of those various general managers and regional senior vice presidents. We'll see Newmont's impact these as we come in and start to go through our rigorous application of our Full Potential program, which is a very structured process that takes place over a couple of months of diagnosis and setting up delivery plans. And then there's normally a 19-24 month delivery program coming out of that diagnostic work. We'll start in June at Peñasquito, we'll move through to Cerra Negro and then through to [indiscernible] and I've had full potential up and running at three of the six sites before we complete this year.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks, Tom. And then just on Slide 9, the overall production guidance of 6 million to 7 million ounces overall; that -- really, just to reiterate, that's the medium term. You still can expect the 2019, maybe 2020 etc. still above that line. I just wanted you color on the first year where you'd be in that range. I appreciate it. It obviously depends on divestments as well, but just some comments there. Thanks.
Tom Palmer: Sure thing. And as we said, this did not exclude basically what Goldcorp's production was through April 17 of this year. So, we'll be addressing that as we go through and have a full 12 months of that production in 2020. This had 12 months for 2019 and it won't be that high. The other thing it doesn't have is any changes as a result of the Nevada joint venture and what might occur due to further project optimization and asset optimization including potential divestment. So, I would stay tuned for what we'd give in terms of an update in July, Chris, once we have further details to provide on the Goldcorp piece.
Chris Terry: Okay, thanks. And the last one from me, just in terms of the full potential programs, specifically on the Goldcorp assets, how much of that is cost out itself? You've talked about through port and efficiencies, etc. What is actual -- what are their cost opportunities?
Tom Palmer: The vast majority of the benefit's going to come from processing and then mining improvements and then cost outs is sort of kind of come from support and other improvements to relatively small percentage. If you get back to some of our material posted on the website, that details that you can see a pie chart that breaks out those six assets and the contributions from processing, mining support and other where you see the contributions from processing and mining. A lot of that is going to come from improved productivity and reliability as opposed to cost out.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Morning, Gary, Nancy, Tom. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering now that the contracts were signed, whether you had to -- if you could sort of talk about surprises, positive negatives that you've picked up as you've been looking at the Goldcorp assets that you've acquired.
Tom Palmer: John, it's Tom here. No surprises. Our due diligence in subsequent work I've done to prepare for integration is all holding firm. We remain very excited about what we can bring to improve those efforts under Newmont operating model. And the other thing that is proven as through the integration process is the alignment between the two cultures at Newmont and Goldcorp. I've been over the course of my career involved in a number of integration exercises. This has been by far and away the smoothest integration exercise. We move through day one last week without a blip. And I think that's a credit to both the teams at Newmont and Goldcorp and reflection on the alignment between the two cultures of our organizations.
John Bridges: Okay, great. Just sort of follow-up. I didn't see any mention, although it's early stage of the Colombian assets that I remember being added as a sort of risk to add a little spice to the portfolio. Now that you're differentiating yourself as being a lower risk gold mining alternative, where do you think Columbia sits or does it fit in the new portfolio?
Tom Palmer: Oh, thanks. Thanks, John. I'm going to hand over to Randy Angle to cover that.
Randy Angle: Hi, John. Thanks for the question. John, we still think that there's very good potential in Columbia. We view it as a long-term opportunity for us and as we step back and take it look at the entire portfolio, we'll be, of course, looking at the exporation potential of Columbia relative to all other regions out there.
John Bridges: Okay. But that's going to need some funding shortly, isn't it?
Randy Angle: Yes, it will. It will need ongoing funding as they continue to ramp up to our production.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Thank you. Tom, I think it's a question for you. $365 million in synergies. I think the impression was always that that would be a number that could be achieved relatively quickly, but what kind of ramp up do you expect? What run rate should we be looking for over the next couple of years and towards getting to that number?
Tom Palmer: Thanks for the question, Greg. We'll certainly get through the three Goldcorp sites that have the greatest value contribution. So, we're predicting that $365 Peñasquito to be $50 million Cerro Negro $35 and Éléonore $25. We'll have been through our diagnostic process and be delivering value from the full potential work before the end of the year at each of those three sites. And then rolling through into the remaining three sites in the first part of 2020, we will throw our full potential process. You identify quick wins and so you'd expect to start to see value coming from that. There'll be some other activities that might take the order of 12 to 18 months through the full full-potential program. Then in terms of other synergies, the $100 million for G&A, that will come very quickly in terms of rationalizing and we're well down the path of rationalizing the workforce between Vancouver and in Denver and so on and so forth. And then the non-labor costs that come from that and we are actively involved in starting to get some of the supply chain efficiencies coming through. So, we will start to see run rate starting immediately. It will ramp up as we roll out full potential over the course of the next 12 months across the six Goldcorp assets.
Greg Barnes: So, should I imply that by, let's say the end of 2020, you think you'll be close to our ramp up full run rate, $365 million?
Tom Palmer: I think that's a very good estimate to make, Greg.
Greg Barnes: Okay. And just to cycle back to Musselwhite. How serious was that fire? And I'm hearing numbers out there like you could be not back in the mind fully operational until six months from now.
Tom Palmer: It's still early days. It was a serious fire. Any conveyor fire underground is serious. Fortunately, it occurred at a shift change. So, there was now an underground. The fire was contained. But you have to go through when you have an underground fire that involves a conveyor system that you've got to go through a very robust process to understand how you access that area, understand the work to rehabilitate the tunnel and then to remove the damaged conveyor but the rubber and a conveyor structure. So, the team there are currently working through in parallel with the investigation. I work method to be able to re-mediate both the tunnel and to remove the damaged equipment. So, it's still early days to understand that remediation method and then how we might be able to then work through that conveyor tunnel and effect those repairs. So, it's just too early, Greg, to make an estimate of how long that will take.
Operator: The next question will come from Tanya Jakusconek of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Great. It's Tonya from Scotiabank. Thank you. Okay. I just wanted to come back to -- I've a technical question for Tom and a financial for Nancy. Just, Tom, and again, we didn't have the Goldcorp numbers, but do you have a sense, at least on Musselwhite what the guidance would have been for the year without this fire? So, we at least would know what Q1 was like and what was the guidance of the year so we could take a stab at what we think could happen at the facet?
Tom Palmer: I think it's still early days for us to be at it sort of to give you that sort of guidance. I'd hope by the time we come out with our second quarter results, we'll be able to give you a better direction and we'll have greater clarity on the remainder...
Tanya Jakusconek: Oh yes, no worries, Tom. What was the guide? What did the Musselwhite doing in Q1 and what was the original guidance for the year from Musselwhite for 2019?
Tom Palmer: The issue with Musselwhite is that the materials handling system was an important part of the production for this year. And that will be delayed in ramping up in the second half. So, that's why it's something that we need to work our way through.
Gary Goldberg: And back to the core of your question, it was a little over 200,000 ounces what was planned for the full year out of a Musselwhite tangent, just to give you a flavor. So, even if you cook that out of our overall guidance, it's pretty small...
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes. And I just wondered if we had similar production in Q4 2018 would have been similar to Q1 just for us to play around with that number. Okay. I'll play around with it. Just looking at then, Tom, at any of the other Goldcorp of assets, you said all of the other ones performed in line for Q1. You flagged the Peñasquito and Cerro Negro, the grades are ramping up, so better second half of the year. Are there any other assets coming in a commercial, are there any other assets that we should be -- you want to flag to our attention within the Goldcorp portfolio that may differ from that guidance that was originally put out?
Tom Palmer: No, there isn't, Tanya. There's no other. Everything's pretty consistent with what I had provided.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And maybe then just for Nancy just coming in, you mentioned that to look at everything from April 17 for the guidance for Goldcorp. I'm obviously on the Barrick joint venture side on Nevada would be your share from when deal closes. Can I just ask what, besides that, from an operational standpoint, what other costs do we look at for yourself that we may be incurring in Q2 that we haven't thought about? We obviously have the goodwill allocation that we'll take a stab at that. Are there any other costs that we should be factoring in or accounting that wouldn't have an impact in our forecast?
Nancy Buese: Yes. From an accounting perspective you've got it right. There will certainly be some noise in the system around the timing of these various transactions and the changes in reporting fundamentally will be the biggest piece of that. And then certainly we'll have integration costs for both of the transactions, which we'll report to you and then those will be adjusted out for earnings purposes. But yes, fundamentally, we'll be very transparent about those, but there will be additional integration costs for sure. And we will note everything out and then give you our best bridges to understanding both the impact of the Goldcorp transaction and then the Nevada joint venture when that concludes or when that closes.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. We already had some integration costs. So, how much more are we getting in through to Q2? Do we have an idea there?
Nancy Buese: We really aren't in a position to give guidance on that, but we'll certainly report it and be transparent about it upon conclusion.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So more in Q2. And just on your Nevada joint venture with the Barrick, costs will be reported differently. I would suspect you're under U.S. GAAP, they are under IFRS, will adjustments have to be made for yourselves when we see those numbers?
Nancy Buese: Yes, absolutely. So, Barrick will create the financial statements that underlie the joint venture. Those adjustments will be made and then we will report our share from a proportional consolidation basis and that will be a separate segment in Newmont's financial statements. So, that's how you'll see that running through.
Tanya Jakusconek: And then you'll adjust for your U.S. GAAP cost?
Nancy Buese: Correct. It will be reported under our standards.
Tanya Jakusconek: Anything else different from that joint venture besides that to look forward to?
Nancy Buese: No. We're still working with Barrick as you would imagine on how we will receive all of the financial information that comes through. But again, we'll report that to the best of our ability through as a separate segment. So, you'll have good visibility to our 38 point whatever share of the entire venture. But I would say most of the information and guidance and financial results of the joint venture, you should look to Barrick for those.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then maybe lastly, when will you be hosting your investor day, so we'd have a lot more clarity on all of this?
Nancy Buese: We're still working to determine that date. Again, we are in the process today of absorbing and gathering all of our information for the Combined Newmont Goldcorp entity. The piece of that we'll have to work for is getting the very material impacts of Nevada JV. That will be something Barrick will compile once we feel like we're in a position to have all of those data points, we would want to provide a very complete picture to the marketplace. So, that will sort of TBD based on when we believe we'll have best information on the Nevada JV.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen Walker: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just a question, Tom if you would. At Peñasquito, the blockage, the roadblock, the disruption around the gate, can you talk a little bit about what triggered that and kind of how the discussions are going? My understanding there's an issue with water or materials handling or something. There was some sort of catalyst that triggered that blockage around, I believe it was water.
Tom Palmer: Morning, Stephen. It's a complex issue. And it's an issue that sort of covers some community members from the local community with some concerns around water and some issues around a trucking contractor. That's a complex issue in that it involves a couple of issues coming together. The blockade is partial and the discussions taking place with those folks are very active and I think I'm quite positive that they'll work through to a sensible resolution in the near-term. So, it's a complex issue. It's a contractor and some community issues and I think our team on the ground there working with local authorities and those stakeholders are actively working through a resolution of those matters.
Stephen Walker: And just as a follow-up, I know that there was a negotiation to get access to water or transport water over properties. Is it just a revisiting of those previous issues with the landholders or is there something more serious with respect to water and material handling, I guess water sourcing or water effluent that may be escaping? Is it use of water or is it -- why does it...
Tom Palmer: No new issues, Stephen. So, it's associated with supply of water rather than issues with water quality or anything like that.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners, please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen, Nancy. For Gary and Tom, maybe you could share a little bit relative to your initial expectations going into the joint venture with Barrick in Nevada in some of the meetings you've had on the board level with them, have expectations been or exceeded? How do you think about that relative to the dreams that you guys have created finally?
Gary Goldberg: I think it's still early days, Michael. Gary here, as we work very closely with Barrick in terms of items in regards to integration, how you bring the two workforces together. It's been a big focus. Right now, I'd say we're moving as expected at this stage. Regular meetings, in fact, it's been weekly meetings at the board level and meetings not just the board level, a number of folks where this financial folks, human resources, technical folks as we work to help set this joint venture up with Barrick.
Michael Dudas: And my follow-up is when you think about certainly since January's announcement of the Goldcorp transaction and your announcement of the investors or potential in the range, sort of a lot of phone calls back and forth, do you feel like you can be patient on that front or is the marketplace any signals that can maybe generate some better interests in some opportunities here in the more near to intermediate term or is it just trying to get everything under control relative to the integration of both companies to kind of set up where that might be and how we could see those divestitures come through?
Gary Goldberg: No, I think we gave that guidance back in January just to give a flavor that we weren't going to be locked on to any particular asset going forward. We want to make sure we understand the full potential of each of the assets, which is why we're going through the process to make sure we bring in our operating model and take a good look at each of the assets before we make any decisions to move ahead, maybe too hastily on divestiture. So, we continue to get inbounds as you suggest from a variety of different folks and we'll take those on board but we want to really make sure that we understand the assets well before moving forward. And frankly, we didn't have any divestments built into our acquisition model as we went forward, so we're under no pressure to divest in any kind of a timeframe.
Operator: The next question will come from John [indiscernible] Independent Research. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. Could you provide a little more explanation of the 38% JV terms in Nevada with Barrick? It looks like it's proportional to gold reserves, maybe giving a little credit for what's on the come at gold rush and four mile [ph] as your car went underground along canyon without giving new enough credit for maybe saving Barrick $0.75 billion for another grocer [ph] and the land, water rights and infrastructure of Newmont's bigger land position.
Tom Palmer: Well, thanks. Thanks, John. I think quite simply the 38.5% versus 61.5% that we came up with was based on consensus NAV by a number of analysts and it took the median of those numbers and came up with that. You could have gone at it lots of different ways and as you know, in the past we tried lots of different ways and never came to a landing. I think we came to a very successful landing both, for Newmont and for Barrick here going forward. And if there is additional reserves that are found on our property that aren't currently in a reserve resource, we have a 1.5% NSR royalty that would get paid to either one of the parties. The one asset that was excluded by Barrick was four mile because that's one that they still continue to go through and hadn't taken to a point where they understand the reserve resource position. So that has a process in which we can bring that into the joint venture going forward. So, I'm actually quite pleased with where we landed here and how we're bringing things forward and continue to work well with Barrick to bring this joint venture to reality in the next couple of months.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for closing remarks.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you for joining our call this morning. I'd really like to thank the entire Newmont Goldcorp team for their efforts to continue to deliver safe and strong business results. We look forward to providing you updates on Newmont Goldcorp, the world's leading gold company throughout the year. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Year-End and Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's full year and fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2, before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. Turning to Slide 3, here you will find additional information on the proposed transaction between Newmont and Goldcorp. Our preliminary proxy statement was filed this morning and is also available on our website. Now, I'll hand it over to Gary on Slide 4.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Jess. Good morning and thank you all for joining this call. Newmont finished the year with a strong fourth quarter as we reached commercial production at Subika Underground delivering another profitable project on time and within budget. But before we get into the details, I want to congratulate our Newmont team for continuing to stay focused on meeting our commitments and for laying the groundwork to lead the Gold sector in profitability and sustainability. Turning to more details on Slide 5. In 2018 Newmont delivered superior operational execution which we demonstrated by producing 5.1 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $909 per ounce overcoming geotechnical challenges and the impacts of planned stripping campaigns in North America and Australia generating $640 million in cost and efficiency improvements from our full potential continuous improvement program more than offsetting inflation and bringing total improvements to more than $2 billion since 2013. And advancing our most promising digital initiatives to improve safety, optimize how we mine and process ore, improve process control systems, and monitor mobile equipment health from a centralized base. We also strengthened our global portfolio of long life assets in all four regions. In North America, we completed the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus projects extending mine life and adding lower cost production in Nevada. We delivered the Cripple Creek & Victor concentrate project to improve recoveries, and we advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to feasibility study. In South America, we commissioned a new primary crusher at Merian, mined first gold at Quecher Main ahead of schedule, and declared first reserves at Yanacocha Sulfides. In Australia, we progressed the Tanami Power project to pave the way for a second expansion of this world class asset. In Africa, we reached commercial production at Subika Underground adding higher grade, lower cost production at Ahafo while advancing future growth opportunities throughout the region. And we outperformed our global exploration targets by adding 6.7 million ounces of reserve and 9.5 million ounces of resource via the drill bit. Finally we progressed in our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by generating adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile with over $6.3 billion of liquidity returning approximately $400 million to shareholders through an industry-leading dividend and share repurchases reflecting confidence in our ability to deliver returns while investing in profitable growth and being recognized as the mining sector leader in sustainability, management performance and for the advancement of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. I’ll expand on this topic on Slide 6. We finished the year with a total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.40 which was a 13% improvement from 2017. However this performance was overshadowed by the death of seven colleagues. While we will never fully recover from these losses, we have made every effort to learn from them, strengthen our controls and share our lessons across the mining industry. Managing risk and embedding controls to prevent fatalities remain at the heart of our safety program and safer operations are also the foundation for driving further efficiency. We remain focused on driving visible felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors. Our long-term success also rest on the standards we set and the values we uphold. In 2018 we were honored to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year, and to be named one of the Wall Street Journal's top 250 Best Managed Companies. Newmont's commitment to inclusion and diversity was also recognized by the National Association of Corporate Directors and in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team, as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. Turning to costs and production on Slide 7. Our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement as our full potential program more than offset inflation and help to mitigate the unit cost impact from planned stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks and Boddington and through continued outperformance across our portfolio we delivered 5.1 million attributable ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $909 per ounce in 2018, below our full-year guidance of $915 to $955 per ounce. Looking forward 2019 all-in sustaining costs are expected to be $935 per ounce with lower cost production at Subika Underground and reduced power costs at Tanami helping to offset headwinds such as geotechnical challenges at Carlin and KCGM and input cost pressures. In 2019 we expect to produce approximately 5.2 million ounces driven primarily by higher grades at Ahafo, and the completion of the Ahafo mill expansion to offset lower grades in North America and ongoing going stripping at Boddington. Turning to our latest projects on Slide 8. In November we reached commercial production at Subika Underground in Africa on schedule and within budget. And we are currently executing three projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In South America, we're extending oxide production through Quecher Main where we reached the first gold in December and mining continues on schedule. In Africa we continue to make good progress on the Ahafo mill expansion which together with Subika Underground will extend profitable production until at least 2029. Finally, in Australia our Tanami Power project is nearing completion to lower costs and emissions while facilitating future growth. These projects are expected to deliver an average internal rate of return above 20%. Turning to our reserve and resource delivery on Slide 9. In 2018 we added 6.7 million ounces of reserves exceeding our exploration target of 4 million ounces all by the drill bit. We achieved these results while maintaining the same $1200 reserve gold price as the prior-year. Exploration also added 9.5 million ounces of resources more than offsetting the conversion of resource ounces to reserves. We also added 5.3 million ounces of resource through our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Galore Creek project. As you can see in this waterfall chart, reserve additions of 6.7 million ounces exceeded depletion of 6.1 million ounces but were offset by revisions of 3.6 million ounces largely driven by orebody and metallurgical model changes at Phoenix and pit design changes at Carlin driven by increased costs and the removal of the layback at Gold Quarry. Our reserve additions are spread equally across our four regions and our resource additions were primarily in Australia and South America. Positive additions and revisions to our resource base included a first-time declaration of 2.2 million ounces from the Yanacocha Sulfides as this project moved into definitive feasibility; 800,000 ounces at Tanami from conversion of resource ounces at [Oran] [ph]; 600,000 ounces at CC&V due to mine planning improvements; 550,000 ounces at Boddington from drilling and pit optimization, and 360,000 ounces at Ahafo due to the improved [wall][ph] control guidelines allowing for steeper slopes. Our average reserve grade also increased 4% to 1.19 grams per tonne largely due to higher grade additions from several of these sites and the reclassification to resource of lower grade ounces at Carlin and Phoenix. I want to acknowledge our exploration and our operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these results. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 10 to discuss our financial performance.
Nancy Buese: Thanks Gary. Turning to Slide11 for the financial highlights. I'm pleased in place to report strong fourth quarter results consistent with our back half weighting. Compared to the prior-year quarter, we delivered a 6% increase in revenue to more than $2 billion. Adjusted net income of $214 million or $0.40 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $759 million an increase of 5%. Cash from continuing operations was $742 million a slight decrease compared to $748 million last year. Turning to Slide 12 for review of earnings per share in more detail. For the fourth quarter we recorded a small loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $3 million or approximately breakeven. Adjustments for the quarter included $0.08 related to impairments to asset and investments, $0.23 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts, and $0.09 related to a change in the fair market value of our marketable equity securities portfolio and the impact of reclamation and restructuring charges. Taking these adjustments into account we delivered fourth quarter adjusted net income of $0.40 per diluted share. Turning to our full-year results on Slide 13. Comparing 2018 results to the prior year, our revenues held steady at $7.3 billion despite planned stripping at Boddington and Twin Creeks along with geotechnical headwinds at Carlin and KCGM. We generated net income of $718 million or $1.34 per diluted share, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. Cash from continuing operations was $1.8 million a decrease of approximately $300 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments. And in 2018, we declared dividend of $0.56 per share demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Turning to the full-year adjustments through earnings per share on Slide 14. Here you see the impacts of impairments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.76 per share which primarily occurred in third quarter and related to assets and exploration properties in North America. Other adjustments for the year included $0.03 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.02 due to other items. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered full-year adjusted net income of a $1.34 per diluted share. Turning to our capital priorities on Slide 15. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of more than $6 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.3x. We remain well-positioned to execute on our capital priorities including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of mines to improve life and build a stronger reserve base, and returning cash to shareholders. For 2018 we delivered nearly $400 million and returns to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks, and in 2019 we expect to maintain an industry-leading dividend of $0.56 per share. We will also continue with our share repurchase program which aims to offset potential dilution by maintaining a constant share count. In summary, we’re well-positioned to continue our trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by focusing on value generation over the long-term. And now I’ll pass to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on Slide 16.
Tom Palmer: Thanks Nancy. In 2019 we delivered solid performance across all four regions driven by culture of continuous improvement. As Gary mentioned, our full potential program generated $640 million in cost efficiencies and productivity improvements exceeding our targets and continuing to offset headwinds. I would like to thank all of our teams for demonstrating our commitment to share ideas, and learn from each other success. We are clearly seeing the benefits from this global collaborative approach. Looking forward, we remain excited about advancing several technology initiatives including Smart Mine, advanced process control, and connected worker which will take our performance to the next level. These technology programs are also being applied on a globally consistent basis. Turning to Slide 17. Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and the proven operating model we need to create value over the long-term. Over the last few years out team has executed on our strategy, and set out up our business for success over the long-term by optimizing portfolio, for the monetization of non-core assets, advancing profitable growth, and adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of about $750 per ounce, investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia, and strengthening our balance sheet to provide us financial flexibility. Turning to review of our regional performance starting with North America on Slide 18. The region produced more than 2 million ounces of gold in 2018 at all-in sustaining costs of $928 per ounce. At Carlin geotechnical challenges impacted performance during the year but the site delivered a strong fourth quarter on the back of improving grades at Leeville. The region is advancing work to improve their geotechnical risk management which will help inform our path for optimizing Carlin's mine plans and safely reentering Gold Quarry. For the consequence of the Gold Quarry remediation work, production may be impacted by approximately 70,000 ounces in 2019. However, it should be noted that Gold Quarry is only expected to contribute 5% to 10% of Carlin's total production over the next three years. And we expect to recover some of these ounces over the medium-term. In January, we reached to three year labor agreement at Carlin, our only operation in North America covered by collective labor agreement. The updated agreement covers approximately 1500 employees and is in line with the assumed wage increases in our guidance. CC&V also ended the year strongly with the expected grow down of stockpiled concentrates, and recovery of deferred leach production from earlier this year. The concentrate projects is fully operational and we're seeing the expected recovery improvements at both CC&V and Carlin's Mill 6. At Phoenix, we saw higher gold grades and improved mill recovery and at Twin Creeks we generated steady production with higher grades from the underground and continued full potential improvements. And last month the Long Canyon Phase 2 project advanced to feasibility study is what continues to inform our approach to the sites open pit and underground growth potential. Looking forward, the region also continues to progress studies of Newmont Underground expansions at Carlin and CC&V, bolster advancing studies at Galore Creek with Teck. Turning to South America on Slide 19. In 2018, the region produced approximately 670,000 ounces of attributable gold at all-in sustaining cost of around $800 per ounce, an improvement of more than 7% from the prior year. At Yanacocha our optimized mill blending strategy improved recoveries after processing high-grade ore from Tapado Oeste pit resulting in steady production at lower costs. At Merian continued improvements in mine and mill productivity through full potential delivered very strong performance in the fourth quarter. With the new primary crusher in place to help sustain mill throughput as the site transitions from saprolite to harder rock starting later this year. Development at Quecher Main is progressing on course as stripping and leach pad construction continues to plan. In December we produced first gold from an existing leach pad and remain on track to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. In January, we advanced the sulfides project to the definitive feasibility stage. In the first phase of this project, we will process sulfide material from the Yanacocha Verde Open Pit and Chaquicocha Underground Mine both of which are located within Yanacocha's current operational footprint. The well will be processed through an integrated flow sheet including new flotation, pressure oxidation, neutralization, solvent extraction and electric winning facilities. Upon reaching commercial production, we expect the project to produce approximately 500,000 consolidated gold equivalent ounces per year for the first five years from 2024 to 2028 and a total of around 6.5 million gold equivalent ounces through to 2039. We expect to make a full funds decision on Yanacocha Sulfides in 2020 and the project has a three-year development schedule. Additional Sulfide resources that are not currently included in the first phase of the project are expected to further extend the loss of the Yanacocha operation. Turning to Australia on Slide 20. The region produced over 1.5 million ounces of gold in 2019, the all-in sustaining costs of $845 per ounce. At our world-class Tanami asset we delivered record production of just under 500,000 ounces supported by a strong fourth quarter driven by high grades. And earlier this month we received approval from the Northern Territory Government to introduce gas to the pipeline allowing commissioning on gas to commence at the Tanami Power project. Gas is now being introduced into the pipeline and we remain on track to have connected gas - connected to gas generator power by the end of this quarter. Once operational, Tanami's Power cost will reduce by 20% resulting in a net cash savings of $35 per ounce while flooring carbon emissions by 20%. This power project also sets the stage for the next phase of profitable at Tanami. Steady work on Tanami Expansion 2 continues to progress towards a full funds decision in the second half of this year. Tanami Expansion 2 has the potential to extend mine life to 2040, reduce operating costs by approximately 10% and add an incremental 100,000 ounces per year from 2023 through 2027. In addition to the study work thinking of the shaft for Tanami Expansion 2 has now progressed beyond 70 meters. At Boddington, we delivered record mill throughput in 2018 of 40.2 million tonnes. This was delivered on the back of sustained full potential improvements over the last six years. The most recent being an optimized maintenance strategy that through improved reliability allowed us to move from four major shafts to three in 2018. Tripping on the south laybacks will continue as planned through 2019 and into 2020 before we reach higher grades in 2021. At KCGM the team is managing through geotechnical challenges which reduced mining activity in the back half of 2019. Remediation work is ongoing and we expect to continue drawing down stockpiles this year to help offset reduced mining rates. Stripping in the Morrison starter pick commenced in November and we achieved first production in December ahead of schedule. Morrison starter opens up an additional mining area in the Fimiston Pit and allows the site to sustain operations whilst we continue to work to optimize a longer-term mine plans. Morrison starter is expected to contribute approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces through 2021. Remaining Morrison resource is being evaluated as part of KCGM's broader Golden Mile Growth Study. Now over to Africa on Slide 21, the region produced 850,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs below $800 per ounce. At Akyem, strong performance came as a result of continued full potential improvements and the most notably within the process plant where the teams reduced the frequency and duration of mill shuts, and delivered higher-than-expected throughput and recovery. Looking forward the site is targeting further cost efficiency improvements by reducing part and services spending associated with regular mill maintenance. And at Ahafo increased tons and grade contributed to a strong fourth quarter. Subika Underground reached commercial production in November on schedule and within budget and the team is making good progress on the Ahafo mill expansion. Civil construction of the primary crusher is completed, leach tanks have been placed and structure work on the [indiscernible] SAG mill is complete. Ahafo is looking forward to a strong 2019 with higher grades expected to continue from both the Subika Open Pit and Underground combined the mill expansion project reaching commercial production in the second half of this year. Finally we continue to advance our regional growth studies and are working to prioritize out various opportunities on a value versus risk basis. Looking further ahead at our project pipeline on Slide 22. Our pipeline is amongst the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins, reserves and resources. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Quecher Main in Peru, the Ahafo Mill expansion and the layback of the Awonsu Pit at Ahafo and the Tanami Power project in Australia. Three midterm projects will improve our outlook, the Yanacocha Sulfides, Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2 shown here in green. Finally we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to Slide 23. If you look at our production profile for the next seven years through 2025, annual gold production is forecast to remain around 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is also expected to grow over this period. This profile includes production from existing operations, as well as sustaining and current projects included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our midterm projects Yanacocha Sulfides, Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2 which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows a longer-term projects including Long Canyon Phase 2, Chaquicocha Oxides and Akyem Underground all representing further upside. Overall Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage. Now I’ll hand it back to Gary on Slide 24.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 25. In January we announced an agreement to combine with Goldcorp with the vision of creating the world's leading gold business as measured by assets, people, prospects and value. Newmont Goldcorp will operate a world-class portfolio of assets on four continents with the ability to target sustainable and profitable production of between 6 million and 7 million ounces of gold annually and have the benefit of additional revenue of about $1.5 billion from other products including silver, zinc and copper. We will have the sectors best project pipeline and exploration portfolio in terms of both quality and depth, and these prospects translate to the gold sector's largest reserve and resource base with long-term leverage to the gold price. Finally we will continue to have the financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities, deliver sustainable shareholder returns through an industry-leading dividend, and maintain an investment grade balance sheet. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter following our special stockholder meetings in April and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. In the meantime, we're working to ensure a smooth transition and integration as we position the business to deliver industry leading returns for decades to come. Newmont Goldcorp's value proposition is unparalleled. We expect to generate $100 million in annual pretax synergies from G&A savings and a streamlined supply chain, and we plan to achieve additional benefits from the application of our proven full potential continuous improvement program where we have proven we can deliver sustainable cost efficiencies, and productivity improvements of approximately $75 per ounce once fully ramped up. This equates to about $165 million per year combined with the $100 million of annual synergies. These efforts have the potential to deliver more than $2.5 billion in total value creation. Further upside is expected through project optimization and sequencing, asset investments, and an increased and focused investment in exploration potential of these assets. Newmont Goldcorp's operations and project pipeline provides the foundation for steady profitable production, stable cash flow generation and improving costs over the long term and gives a significant optionality and the ability to continue to advance only those projects that meet our minimum hurdle rate of 15% at a $1200 gold price. I recently had the opportunity to visit Red Lake and Musselwhite meeting with more than 600 people in crew meetings at the sites. I'm pleased by the quality of the talent that I met and the future operational potential of these assets. Our teams will be working diligently over the coming weeks to close the transaction and we anticipate providing an update to our 2019 guidance in due course along with a view of our longer-term guidance later this year at our Investor Day. We're very excited about this combination and have clear implementation plans in place to create the world's leading gold business. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the Operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Many congratulations of the results. Good to see some ounces showing up from the sulfide project in Yanacocha. I was just wondering to what extent is this - the last word and to what extent is the vehicle to attach on these the satellite ore neighboring deposits which looks if they can create nice synergies, how does that work?
Gary Goldberg: I think I’ll start off here and then hand over to Tom. When you look this really just involves our Chaquicocha deposit and part of the Verde deposit which sits off to the side but there's other satellite deposits as you point out John that are not yet included in here because we're doing some additional exploration work. I don’t know Tom if you've got anything to add.
Tom Palmer: John one of the areas we’re looking at for additional oxide is the - in the Chaquicocha Underground we are seeing some additional oxide that might help serve as a further bridge between oxides and sulfides at Yanacocha. And also share some infrastructure in terms of the underground development at the Chaquicocha Underground. But there is a quite extensive sulfide deposits across that existing operational footprint at Yanacocha. So, our Verde Open Pit Chaquicocha Underground represent Phase 1, but there are some other quite exciting deposits that serve [indiscernible] beyond that Phase 1 stage of the project.
John Bridges: I guess you’re quite busy with other things at the moment but are there any catalyst with respect to in talking to neighbors about working other deposits into the infrastructure you got there, the footprint?
GaryGoldberg: I think that's one that we’re open to John when it comes to going Galeno and Michiquillay and how that might fit with Conga, but I think like we’re looking at with the Goldcorp transaction when is the right time to bring those in and we can look at proper sequencing and how that might work best.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Murphy of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Murphy: I am just wondering with some of the comments on full potential and I guess there is some mention on costs playing a role in some of the reserve reduction. Just interested in what you're seeing generally in the industry on cost inflation and whether you still think you have enough low hanging fruit or potential to take cost out and continue to keep cost flat?
Tom Palmer: Tom Palmer, here. We are seeing some headwinds say in Australia particular where the iron ore markets heated up so the labor markets warmed up in Australia. So we are seeing attrition a little bit higher, so we’re seeing some headwinds in that area. But our full potential program and the commitment each of our operating General Manager make every year in their planning process is to offset inflation and we have assumptions for inflation building to our planning process to ensure that they have baked into their plans clear projects that can offset inflation as a minimum and then deliver beyond that. And we’ve been out to do that over the last several years, we see it in our plans going forward and we’re confident that we still got a pipeline of projects that can continue to at a minimum offset inflation.
Matthew Murphy: And then just a quick highly specific one, sorry hopefully this doesn't put you on the spot but we're just trying to reconcile the CC&V mill production in Q4. It looked like it was double roughly what would be implied from throughput grade recovery et cetera. Does that have something to do with drawing down stockpiles or something?
Tom Palmer: That is linked to the concentrates we now produce at CC&V that we had been stockpiling whilst we got our logistics process in place to ship them to Carlin's Mill 6. And we drew down all of those concentrates that we had stockpile through the year. So what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is all of that concentrate we produced through 2018, getting prices through Carlin's Mill 6, at improved recovery then what you would have seen at CC&V's Mill 6 and helping contribute to improve recoveries in Carlin's Mill 6. So that's what you're seeing in those numbers for CC&V in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: The first one I had is just how we think about the progression of this year. So if the deal is to close in 2Q would you expect that you would then give combined guidance shortly after that for the Company? And would it also include say three to five years out as well or will that take some time. And the second question I had is just around the proxies that are been announced. Just trying to reconcile some of the CapEx numbers that you provided in December and the numbers that are given there for Goldcorp and for Newmont just struggling to square a couple of the numbers. May be you could just step through what's in the proxy CapEx numbers in particular? Thanks.
GaryGoldberg: Couple of things, in regards to guidance what we look to do once we close is to provide an update to 2019 guidance after we've closed and gone through the process to make sure we've got a good understanding of how to properly present because we do look at costs in particular differently than Goldcorp has historically. So we will come out with that guidance. In terms of longer-term guidance, we look to target our Investor Day at the end of the year. Right now we’re looking in either November/December to hold that Investor Day to provide the longer term guidance and outlook for the combined business. In regards to the proxy question, I'd probably need to get more specifics because that’s a backward looking document and it’s not looking forward. So I'm not clear exactly what you want to cover there, but we’re happy if you want to get back to us with the detail on that we can provide it.
Chris Terry: Thanks for the color guys. Its more this 2019 and forward CapEx numbers and then free cash flow showing within the business and you take that the forward CapEx numbers for Newmont, they look higher than the numbers given in the December CapEx numbers. So I am just trying to work out the forward CapEx reconciliation?
Nancy Buese: Yes Chris. The proxy is really mostly backward looking so probably the best thing to do is take the Newmont guidance that we gave you in December period assume for the Newmont that stays the same for now. And then let us give you more information after the transaction closes relative to the Goldcorp spend and assets. I think that will be the best way to put things together for 2019 and then certainly we’ll give you the full view. We want to make sure we reconcile all the components there is significant differences between the way the two companies have reported and we want to get that very right before we make that public. So give us a little bit of time but post closing will give you a clear view on 2019 numbers at least.
Chris Terry: And the last one from me, just in terms of the updated guidance and what we should expect. If you back out any potential divestments that might occur from the existing assets on the Newmont side, would we expect the Newmont guidance would stay the same as in for the existing assets?
GaryGoldberg: At this stage we wouldn't be projecting any asset sales. I think that's something that we typically don't hang the- for sale sign out there. So clearly we’re going to go through a process like we've done with Newmont over the last five years where we assess all of our assets both operating assets and projects and the value versus risk basis and go through in detail making sure we understand what their full potential is before we move forward. So at this stage especially for the 2019 guidance that we provide in due course after close, I wouldn't anticipate seeing any asset sales in there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: My question is with regards again to the proxy just little bit more on this free cash flow projections. I realize it’s a backward looking document but can I understand what kind of assumptions you used for stock for the Goldcorp side of the equation, what gold price were you assuming and also does your projections for free cash flow reflect the 2.2 million to 2.4 million guidance, 1 million ounce guidance that they put out and the further implications of that?
Nancy Buese: Yes, so in terms of projections for the Goldcorp piece they use a $1300 long-term gold price and so that’s what we have baked in. So that’s sort of the baseline. And then I guess your question about cash flows, again this is all just based on the initial modeling and the basics from an accounting point of view. So if there's further details on that, you're trying to get to let us help you try to work through because they're meant to give a view, but again this is a preliminary review of accounting valuation based on the business model and a deal model. We still have additional work to do. The evaluation itself will change up to and including the date of closing.
Anita Soni: Right, no I understand there is going to be differences in cost but the CapEx and revenue seems like it should be pretty straightforward. And then on your side of the equation on Newmont and I think this is what Chris is driving at, the prior guidance that you guys have put out was around about - and I hesitate to say guidance but if you add the two, the guidance of about 500 million to 600 million that's in the chart. And then also in another chart says 500 million of ongoing development capital. So to get you to about 1 billion, whereas the proxy is saying in some years it's 1.2 to 1.3 for you. So I'm just curious as to what precipitated that increase in CapEx?
Nancy Buese: Yes again, kind of coming back to the basis of the proxy. That is not guidance that's provided in there. So when you see the spend numbers relative to capital, I wouldn't translate that to guidance. Let us give that to you once we actually get closed because it's really an accounting view based on a model and we haven't gotten - let us do the work to give you proper guidance about spend.
Anita Soni: Thank you. So you said it was $1,300 growth for Goldcorp sided equation, what did you use for yours?
Nancy Buese: $1,200.
Anita Soni: $1,200 for yours? Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Gary Goldberg: Anita maybe just as we get the next call and just to give some high level numbers, we're talking of targeting 6 million to 7 million ounces out into the future - the foreseeable future. What we see here over the next five years is a roughly $800 million a year in development costs on a combined basis and roughly about $1 billion a year on sustaining capital. So that total is kind of a high level. We'll have to get into the details and we'll give much more detail as we get into providing guidance near the end of the year with the Investor Day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Just may be a question for Tom, just coming back to the reserves. Tom, can you give us a little bit more details on the 3.6 million ounce revision that happened between Phoenix and Gold Quarry, I guess Carlin and what exactly happened there?
Tom Palmer: At Phoenix, more infill drilling allowed us to improve our resource models and get better reconciliations between the model and what we're mining and processing. So it was really a process of continuing to refine and optimize their models through infill drilling and then making those adjustments so that we have more reliability and predictability in terms of what we have in the ground and what we actually produce through the plant. So the prices are continuing to tidy up and improve those models at Phoenix. And at Carlin, two laybacks in the Gold Quarry pit, that as we got to the point in that planning processes we were optimizing those laybacks, we were able to improve the performance of one of the laybacks and actually pull ounces out of one of the laybacks, by adding the second layback into the first layback. So improved one layback but that led to the other layback becoming uneconomic in terms of our reserves requirements and so it pushed out. So it's really about that Carlin going through that stage of mine planning and doing the optimization on the next phase as layback's coming through.
Tanya Jakusconek: And at Phoenix, the improved reconciliation that you did with the infill drilling, did you just find that these ounces just were not there?
Tom Palmer: Some of that is a complex multi metal ore body. So as you get in and do your drilling, it's about getting better confidence about what's in the ground between the fortitude and bonanza pits and it was a process as we start to do the additional drilling and bring that drilling into the resource model and then bring that into our mine plants that got better confidence in that material. So there's some metal that we previously thought was there that that wasn't there, some metal moves into resource whilst we do more work.
Tanya Jakusconek: What sort of drill phasing did you use? We can take it offline. That's fine.
Tom Palmer: Sounds like a good idea Tanya.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Michael Dudas: Three quick ones. First, like 2018 you had more second-half weighted results, can you comment a bit about how that's going to pull through for 2019? Secondly, as you're combining the best of the best, you're going through the analysis of the merger with Goldcorp; given your development projects right now, is there any change to the timing currently and is that still kind of get [indiscernible] bring everything else on board? And third, you mentioned your Musselwhite and Red Lake business. Have Gary or Tom, have you've been to all the major operations yet with the Goldcorp any other maybe color that you received or what you're expecting to find as you finish up? Thank you.
Gary Goldberg: I'll have Tom start with the 2018 to 2019 comparisons.
Tom Palmer: Our 2019 might be as heavily weighted to the fourth quarter as 2018 was. We had a Tanami, Merian, Ahafo, CC&V, and Carlin, all fourth quarters that were heavily weighted in 2018. There will be a slight waiting to the second-half and fourth quarter mainly around the Ahafo mill expansion coming on stream in the second half of 2019. So we'll see increased volume come through and somewhat into the second half and into the fourth quarter. But not the same level that you saw in 2018.
Gary Goldberg: I think then moving on in terms of as we go through both in terms of project sequencing but more specifically going through and assessing talent and getting to a position to be able to name the senior leaders of the new company. We're going through a very detailed process between Tom and I with a number of meetings with the Goldcorp team and with our own team as we go through that process. Look to have that in a position that by the time we get to close that we're able to name essentially the senior leadership team across the combined Newmont Goldcorp organization. So working through that a very detailed rigorous process, and one that's wanting to make sure we get to meet the people and take the proper amount of time as we go through this process. I think on your last question I did have the opportunity to visit Musselwhite and Red Lake last week and I didn't mention that it was a little cold up there too but that's beside the point. We have - as we've done our due-diligence across the entire business and portfolio, had the opportunity to go to everyone of the operating sites, and as well as had detailed discussions around all the projects and we continue to go through - I look forward to and Tom does as well to get around to visit all the sites in due course but that won't happen here over the next couple of weeks. That'll be over the next several months as we work through that process.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg, for closing remarks.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you for joining our call this morning. We're pleased with our performance in 2018. But as always, our commitment is to take it to the next level by delivering steady gold production at competitive costs, continuing to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders, and technology; and staying ahead of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for joining us and have a safe day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

For those of you participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support today’s discussion. With that, I will turn the call over to David Garofalo.
David Garofalo: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Steady project execution in the third quarter during a transition period at our flagship Peñasquito mine continued the process of expanding and de-risking our operating mines towards achieving our 20/20/20 production growth and cost reduction objectives. At the same time with our renewed focus on exploration, we essentially replaced gold reserve depletion across Goldcorp operated assets establishing a strong foundation to achieve our gold reserve target of 60 million ounces by 2021. Along with our third quarter results, we are providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full year estimates. Goldcorp expects to produce 620,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost, or AISC, of $750 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2018. The reduction in our full year guidance was primarily attributable to lower than expected gold production for Musselwhite during the construction phase of its materials handling project, the cessation of equity accounting of gold production from Leagold earlier in the year after its merger with Brio Gold as well as lower than budgeted grades and recoveries of Pueblo Viejo. However, all other mines remain within the previous guidance ranges and we still expect Cerro Negro and Éléonore to exit 2018 at optimum production rates. During the third quarter of 2018, Goldcorp continued to advance our organic growth opportunities and projects making significant progress on key permitting and development milestones. At Peñasquito, the pyrite leach project, or PLP, completed construction. First gold in commercial production are expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. The materials handling project has achieved 80% overall project construction at Musselwhite. Capital cost of the project remained on budget. While the majority of major infrastructure remains on track for completion in the first quarter of 2019, lower-than-expected productivity and ground support installation has resulted in commissioning now being expected by the third quarter of 2019. Further important project milestones were achieved at the Century Gold project, where our project description was submitted to regulatory authorities and the permitting process was initiated and at the Coffee project, which completed the adequacy phase with the territorial regulator allowing for advancement to the public consultation phase, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter. We have made a next step in our new $350 million sustainable efficiency objective. As you may recall $250 million of these efficiencies were achieved by the second quarter of this year. During the third quarter of 2018, an additional $30 million of efficiencies were identified and are expected to be realized in early 2019. Finally, we are reporting our 2018 reserves of 52.8 million ounces. Reserves increased at Musselwhite and at Cerro Negro two of our more exciting assets where we expect further upside from exploration. Overall, reserve additions at Goldcorp operated sites essentially replaced depletion over the 12 months period as 1.9 million ounces of new gold reserves were added at existing operations. In addition, growth in byproduct metal reserves led to a 2.6% increase in our gold equivalent reserves. Our third quarter financial results include gold production of 503,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $999 per ounce compared to 633,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $827 per ounce during the third quarter of 2017. The production variance comes from Peñasquito’s processing of low grade stockpile during the commissioning phase of the PLP, a lower grade sequence quarter at Cerro Negro and production impacts of the construction of the materials handling system at Musselwhite. AISC was driven by up lower metals production including reduced byproducts from low-grade stockpile at Peñasquito as overall operating costs remained on plan. The net loss for the third quarter was $101 million or $0.12 per share compared to net earnings of $111 million or $0.13 per share for the third quarter of 2017. Net earnings were impacted by non-cash foreign exchange losses of $37 million primarily rising of deferred tax balances. The resulting adjusted net loss was $0.07 per share. Adjusted operating cash flows were $192 million for the quarter compared to $350 million for the third quarter of 2017. With that, I will turn it over to Todd to discuss our operational performance during the quarter.
Todd White: Thanks David. I would like to start by pointing out that we have provided detailed mine by mine estimates of our production forecast for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in our third quarter report. Gold production at Éléonore continued to trend higher reflecting the ongoing ramp up and contribution of higher grade ore during the third quarter of 2018. The mine is expected to exit the year at a sustained mining production rate over 6,000 tons per day or an annualized gold production rate of 400,000 ounces. Higher production at Red Lake was a result of completing its planned transition to a bulk mining operation. With the increased use of bulk mining methods, the milling rate increased 39% over the prior year. Lower production at Peñasquito was as a result of processing near exclusively lower grade ore from stockpiles while completing the stripping campaign in the Peñasco pit and the pre-stripping campaign in the newly developed Chile Colorado pit. Production in the third quarter of 2018 was also impacted by a reduction in mill throughput as much harder low grade ore from stockpiles were processed during the commissioning of the carbon preflotation plant or the CPP which is a component of the PLP. The CPP commissioning proceeded as planned and the circuit has now treated 6 million tons of high carbon ore and is operating at plant capacity. CPP achieved commercial production on October 1. In the fourth quarter the mill feed will consist predominantly of higher grade ore from both Chile Colorado and the Peñasco pit as the stripping campaigns begin to expose ore in both of these pits. Production at Cerro Negro was lower than the second quarter due to planned lower mill grades as a result of mine sequencing in Mariana Central and Eureka, partly offset by continued improved dilution control and higher tons milled as mine production continues to ramp up. The mine tonnage run rate for September was in excess of 3,100 tons of ore per day while maintaining development rates consistent with prior quarters. We continued to expect to achieve run rates of 4,000 tons per day to the mill by the end of 2018, supported by the commencement of an auxiliary shift at the beginning of October. To-date this additional shift has resulted in an increase of approximately 600 tons of mined ore per day which the mill has been able to comfortably process to-date. Marianas Norte development and underground infrastructure was prioritized during the third quarter of 2018, with ramp breakthrough and connection in the Mariana Central achieved on August 27, 2018. With this secondary egress established, production mining activities were initiated during the quarter with initial ore selling and haulage level developed. Development of the Emilia vein will continue for the next 12 months. Both projects are expected to supplement declining Eureka production in 2019. As part of the ongoing development of the Mariana’s district, the next deposit in sequence is San Marcos, where excavation and portal construction activities were initiated in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to commence ramp development activities during the first quarter of 2019 on this deposit. Musselwhite production was slightly lower than the previous quarter as mine sequence was for lower grade material and we continued to see ore tonnage impacts from interactions between the material handling system construction and production. We expect the lower ore production levels at Musselwhite to continue until the third quarter of 2019 after the commissioning of the material handling system. We continue to execute on key milestones during 2018. The down ramp in Cerro Negro’s Mariana’s Norte deposit was completed in August and we have now begun mining activities. The PLP construction is complete and commissioning is underway with first gold and commercial production expected in the fourth quarter. We expect the completion of our optimized pre-feasibility study at Century Gold and Cerro Negro expansion concept study in the fourth quarter with the results to be presented at our Investor Day in January. We are off to a good start on the next phase of our efficiency program with $30 million of the extended $100 million target already identified. In addition, good progress was made on permitting major projects, including Borden, for which operating permits are expected in the fourth quarter as it continues to advance construction towards commercial production in the second half of 2019, a copy which was deemed adequate by the provincial regulator and entered the public consultation period. And at Century Gold which initiated its permitting process with the filing of its project description with regulators during the third quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Paul for an update on our mineral reserves, mineral resources and exploration program. Paul?
Paul Harbidge: Thanks, Todd. Goldcorp’s proven and probable gold mineral reserves as of June 30, 2018 totaled 52.8 million ounces compared to 53.5 million ounces at the end of June 30, 2017 as exploration success at our operating mines essentially replaced gold depleted from production. Goldcorp mineral reserves increased at Musselwhite and at Cerro Negro, while its small net loss in reserves from depletion was experienced at our non-operating mines, including Pueblo Viejo. Goldcorp has increased reserve ounces by 2.8 million ounces net of depletion since the beginning of the 20/20/20 plan in 2017 and remains positioned to deliver 20% reserve growth by 2021. Goldcorp expects contributions to our 20% reserve growth across our portfolio of under-explored land packages in addition to our development and beyond 2020 projects. Porcupine has over 8.4 million ounces in measured and indicated mineral resources and 3.7 million ounces of inferred mineral resources. A portion of resources are supported by the current mining and processing fleet. The Century Gold project envisages a significantly larger scale mining complex, which could afford us the opportunity for further conversion of this substantial gold resource into reserve. At Coffee, an additional 400,000 ounces of indicated and 600,000 ounces of inferred mineral resources are hosted within $1,200 pit shells derived from the inclusion of that material at the Supremo deposit as well as 8 satellite deposits. An 80,000 meter infill drilling program in 2019 is expected to convert a portion to reserves and is being incorporated into future mine designs. In addition, generative work has identified a large portfolio of early-stage targets which remained untested for the potential for future resource and reserve growth. At Pueblo Viejo, a pre-feasibility study is expected in 2020 that has the potential to convert approximately 7 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves, of which Goldcorp’s share will be nearly 3 million ounces. Norte Abierto is expected to complete a prefeasibility study by 2020 on the combined Cerro Casale and Caspiche deposits with a goal of converting a portion of the 26 million ounces of measured and indicated mineral resources and 8 million ounces of inferred mineral resources, of which Goldcorp earns 50%. Turning to Musselwhite, drilling for resource conversion at Musselwhite resulted in the addition of 0.7 million ounces of mineral reserves. At PQ Deeps C-Block, mineralization was extended and mineral reserves achieved approximately 70,000 ounces of gold per 50 meters compared to 25,000 ounces per 50 meters currently being mined and remains open down plunge. During the third quarter, mine exploration at Musselwhite returned positive results from the Lynx North area located up-dip on the Northern Iron Formation above the C Block zone in PQ Deeps, the known Lynx North orebody, 500 meters to the North of the updated 2018 mineral reserves and the combined dip extent of Lynx North and C Block now extends over a vertical depth of 350 meters. Surface drilling from the North Shore of Opapamiskin Lake has recently intersected PQ Deep’s stratigraphy structure alteration and mineralization 1.2 kilometers along strike and down plunge of the updated 2018 mineral reserves, returning strong gold intersect – gold grade intersections. In addition, we have a winter ice program planned to test the Camp Bay and West Anticline zones. The continued expansion of the Musselwhite deposit in both ounces per vertical meter and strike length will be evaluated in various scenarios for how it can supplement or increase production levels in the mid and longer-term. In addition, belt-scale reconnaissance work has been completed and new data will be incorporated into a targeting exercise to drive 2019 field programs. At Cerro Negro, mineral reserve additions of 0.7 million ounces and the increase in mineral resources of 0.7 million ounces were mainly from the Silica Cap deposit, which consists of two main veins, the Silica Cap and Gato Salvaje veins, as well as ancillary hanging wall and footwall veins. Detailed planning is underway on the integration of the Silica Cap deposit with the existing Bajo Negro deposit. These deposits make up the Eastern District mining complex upon which initial development is expected in 2019. A concept study based on the Marianas District and new Eastern District to define optimization scenarios for the operation is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. This work will incorporate trade-off studies on potential mine and mill expansions and grade optimization scenarios. Exploration has now shifted back to testing early-stage targets and six targets have been drill tested thus far, with the objective that at least 10 will be tested by the end of 2018. Encouraging results have been received from the Ricarda vein. Surface work will continue over identified targets in the Southern area of the land package to prepare them for drilling in 2019. More detailed information relating to our reserve and resources statement, as well as additional exploration results from across our portfolio can be found in the press release. And with that, I’ll turn it over for question-and-answers.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton: Good morning, Dave and team, thank you for the update, and I especially like the detailed guidance provided for the fourth quarter for each of the assets. However, if I was to input the uplift of the tons and the grade as you have described actually end up with a number that could be higher then the 620,000 ounces for the fourth quarter, what would your guidance be as to how we should moderate some of those uplifts?
Todd White: Yes, hi, Dave, it’s Todd. Again, I guess where I would say is you can see that recovery is probably the one area where we do see some variability there, the tons and the grade which we have given you are clearly approximate and directional in that, but where we don’t give you as recovery and some of that is due to recovery expectations maybe being somewhat in line or somewhat less depending on order type, but really recovery is the area that you can modify that come to that number that we have guided to.
David Haughton: Okay. So, one of the largest areas of uplift is looking at production of Cerro Negro for instance where you have got the potential for 25% more tons through the mill and 20% more gold, 40% more silver. So what gives you the confidence that you can deliver on that in the fourth quarter given where you were in Q3?
David Garofalo: Yes. So as I mentioned earlier we have implemented an auxiliary shift in the mines, that was not a ramp up, that was really a step change that occurred in day one, that additional tonnage, we are on pace with the numbers we have given you in the MD&A. So I am confident that we are delivering that. And as I said, the mill is handling that tonnage very comfortably. So I have a lot of confidence as the mines are producing it and the mill is more than capable of taking it. So we are on that pace today.
David Haughton: Okay. And then as you said in your commentary, you are pretty confident moving into 2019 at a run-rate of 4,000 tons a day, should we think about 4,000 tons a day as an average for the year or building up to that during the course of Q1 and Q2?
David Garofalo: Yes, David, as we continue to advance our planning process here, we will provide a bit more of that, but clearly, we do expect Cerro Negro at that optimum production rate next year and expect another strong year from Cerro Negro. We are in the middle of that planning process now and we will provide that guidance to you in our Investor Day in January.
David Haughton: Okay. Similar kind of question I guess with Peñasquito and it’s interesting to see that with the 25% or the 45% lift in the gold grade full Q4, it actually brings the year pretty much in line with the guidance that you provided at the beginning of the year of that 0.4 grams for the entire year. So you are still – are you feeling comfortable with that and the expectation I guess moving on there is, are you comfortable going towards the guidance we have been given previously of that 0.45 grams through 2019?
David Garofalo: Yes, David. So, as we have come out of the Q3 on the stockpile we are seeing the great respond as we expected. And you are correct we expect to achieve that grade guidance we gave you prior for Peñasquito. I am very comfortable we are seeing the mine’s response as we expected, we are exposing ore in Chile Colorado and Peñasco and both of those are reconciling as planned. So you know Peñasquito is on the upswing and as we are expecting a strong recovery year for us next year at Peñasquito as we come out of the strip and the grades are performing as expected.
Todd White: And David I might add that the reason we are comfortable with the grade published for Peñasquito really from the beginning of the year is we flipped the quarters around with the early commissioning of PLP and CBP. We took Q4’s production which was expected to be all surface stock, how it moved into Q3 to advance the commissioning. So in fact, we flipped the quarters Q3 and Q4. And we have always had very strong reconciliations of grade to the reserve model at Peñasquito. It’s never been an issue in the past.
David Haughton: Okay, that’s great and thank you for the level of guidance that you have given there.
David Garofalo: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes, thank you. So I just want to go back to that guidance for Q4 and the recoveries that you – the guidance recoveries that you have provided. At Peñasquito, there is only 51% recovery despite the grade lifting substantially. I would have thought that recovery would go up why is the grade or the recovery not improving more?
David Garofalo: Yes, it’s a great point, Greg. Thanks for the question. Because Chile Colorado is a pretty significant component of the ore feed in Q4 while the grades are there, this is sedimentaceous ore out of Chile Colorado which does carry a component of organic carbon. So given that fact, we have that we are estimating perhaps a bit lower recovery on that material for the quarter, so it sort of decouples from call it historic Peñasco grades of that recoveries on that sort of grade.
Greg Barnes: Okay. So continuing on from that with PLP expected to be commissioned fully by the end of Q4, what recoveries are planned for next year 2019, I believe it should be something close to 70% should it not?
Todd White: As again as we bring that up, we would expect to see recoveries in addition to where we were Peñasquito is roughly mid-60s sort of recovery, 60 depending on the grade obviously, but that will be additional PLP. So again in – we are in the budgeting process and the planning and we will be providing that updated expectations for Peñasquito in January. But we do certainly will see an up lift over past recoveries.
David Garofalo: And I think Greg, it’s important to note that our expectation in terms of incremental gold production recovery, silver recovery or like of mine haven’t changed it at Peñasquito’s result of the PLP investment.
Greg Barnes: So, as per the technical report?
David Garofalo: Exactly.
Greg Barnes: Okay. And Dave I don’t want to belabor this point, but in turn you said 20% reserve increase by 2021 was aspirational, now looking to the presentation listening to what Paul was saying, it seems like that’s no longer aspirational, that’s the real target, can you clear that up a little bit?
David Garofalo: I will let Paul talk to where we think the sources of reserve growth are going to come from and he has been quite specific about that material and where it is going to come from. But it is aspirational because it was always subject to drilling whereas our production and cost targets can be quite easily supported by financial models and spreadsheets and why not. So until we do the drilling, until we do the study work we can’t say definitively that we are going to convert that, so there is an aspirational element to it. But I will let Paul interject and talk about again the sources of reserve growth and why it has comprehensive…
Paul Harbidge: Yes. I mean looking at our 5 year plan, 2017 we saw a step change with the conversion of the Century project and then we always saw that 2018 and 2019 were relatively flat in essence that we would replace depletion and so our 20% growth was always back ended into 2020, 2021. And obviously while it is aspirational there are certain key elements that we have to get through one of them being the pre-feasibility study at Pueblo Viejo. There is no risk in those resources, they are already drilled out, it’s about getting the PFS done to get the additional tailings capacity. And then we have go to undertake the big delta as well as down at Norte Abierto and in drilling out the Caspiche deposit. And so it’s about the logistics and staging that drilling that will land on for 2021. But as you see we are getting significant reserve growth at both at Musselwhite and Cerro Negro as we start to implement this new strategy over the last 2 years. We are putting more rigor and discipline into the way that we do archaeological work and we are building that pipeline of targets to offer us the opportunity to make those discoveries. So we are feeling confident about our ability towards that 20% growth.
Greg Barnes: Okay. So Paul just on Silica Cap the 1.4 million ounces in resources that you have identified, largely 1.4 million ounces at Silica Cap, do you see significant scope over and above that in that zone?
Paul Harbidge: Look, when we look at the veins historically we know the Cerro Negro area, we generally see them up between 0.5 million and just over 1 million ounces we have converted, it’s actually 536,000 ounces to reserve. And then we have got due to drill spacing and gold price differential on reserves – on reserve and resources we still got some infill drilling and to do at Silica Cap to add an additional portion. But then obviously one of our priorities is to make additional new vein discoveries to continue to build that reserve base.
Greg Barnes: Okay. Thanks Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Tumazos: Thank you. My questions concern the reserve report and I apologize if I haven’t just said all the details by the information in last deck. The proven and probable fell 700,000 ounces with I guess a declassification at Coffee a couple of mines not replacing production and small gains at Alumbrera, Cerro Negro, Musselwhite, Peñasquito and then the non-reserve resources in all categories fell almost 5 million ounces for gold. In base metals, there was a very big step up in NuevaUnión, in Alumbrera and for Peñasquito Zinc. There were some downgrades in the non-gold resources I guess maybe corresponding some of the other upgrades in base metals, but could you talk to the reserve report and particularly the decline in gold in the improvement in base metals?
David Garofalo: John, in terms of gold, essentially our own 100% operated mines replaced depletion and we were impacted on Pueblo Viejo where its straight depletion and we had no ability to be able to replace that depletion. And then with regard to Coffee, essentially we have got a lot of exploration upside having taken the project over from a junior, we have applied our geological rigor and discipline in terms of geological models just statistical modeling and we felt prudent that at this stage, while the global gold ounce total remain the same that we reclassified some of that material, but we are confident that being able to bring that back in as we continue to complete the detailed infill drilling over the next year. And then we have got a whole portfolio of early stage targets within a very large ground holding and so we are confident that our initial mine plan will have reserve base of just over 2 million ounces.
Todd White: Yes, John, it’s Todd. Maybe I will talk to the base metal add there that you picked up on obviously the zinc was the big add at Peñasquito, where we brought in roughly 600,000 ounces of gold production along with that certainly came zinc and lead reserve growth also. So, that’s really the driver there. The Alumbrera is associated with the underground project, that, that project that, that operation is taking forward so that added the few hundred thousand ounces of gold there as well as some copper that comes with that.
John Tumazos: Union copper went up a great deal?
Todd White: Got it. Obviously, we have continued to fine-tune our model on that in our additional drilling data, there has been really – it’s really model changes within this, call it, the same base mine plan. So, there has not been a mine plan change on that, it’s simply additional drilling data in filling that and remodeling.
John Tumazos: Where the finds more at the Teck legacy Relincho project or El Morro project or El Morro underground deepening or?
David Garofalo: Certainly. Yes, essentially with La Fortuna and Relincho, we remain relatively consistent. And you point out underground potential, I want to be clear that there is no reserve on that yet, but we are certainly doing the work for an opportunity that we see forming under La Fortuna for additional reserve growth there, but what we see obviously was more around La Fortuna than Relincho.
John Tumazos: Thank you very much.
David Garofalo: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Peter Jacobs from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Peter Jacobs: Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. I am trying to reconcile these results with the bigger plan that was laid out back in January at the investor conference for production growth, the building reserves, the A6 lowering and the budget de-leveraging, the debt de-leveraging. It just seems that everything is going backwards and you have failed to make any progress over the last three quarters. And I am trying to think about the accountability on management, how shareholders are expected to understand this, the stocks down 35%, 40%, and it's almost as if business is as usual and it’s another failed gold mining stock in company, it just seems like that's how this thing is playing out. And so, what would you tell an investor, who feels extremely burned from your investor conference back in January, why they should stay constructive with Goldcorp in the management team?
David Garofalo: Sure. Thank you for your question. What I would say as we’ve made this business significantly more efficient than what we inherited several years ago, back in 2015, we produced about 3.5 million ounces of gold at $900 an ounce, and even with the smaller production basis year, we’re expecting to deliver substantially lower all-in sustaining costs, so, we have seen significant efficiencies brought into our business. We’ve grown the reserve base in an industry that’s actually seen a 50% decline in reserves over the last five years, we’ve added about 7% to our reserve base since the beginning of our 2020 plan largely around our operating assets and we are improving our mine plans. We’re still in a significant upward trajectory in our production over the next three to five years and we’re continuing to drive down our all-in sustaining costs both through our efficiency objectives and through the economies of scale inherent and expanding our existing operations. We’ve also added a pipeline of three significant projects in the last couple of years that put this in a enviable position in terms of delivering long-term value creation, namely our own discovery, Century in our backyard Porcupine, the addition of Labeling Yarn [ph] as we bring that to the stage gating and feasibility work and expect to make an investment decision on that over the next couple of years, and our large-scale mineral endowment in Norte Abierto. And I would say in both of those cases in Chile, we’re investing capital responsibly and that we’re consolidating these districts that we bought them cheaply and we’re – in consolidating these districts we’re significantly reducing the capital footprint and being very responsible stewards of capital, but we’re not building duplicate infrastructure beside each other on separately owned land positions. We are consolidating land in those areas and we’re allocating capital in a disciplined way to generate strong rates of return. It’s a long-dated gain, we understand that, and obviously, I understand at this point with the current quarterly results as we are in a good track to achieve a significant production growth as soon as this quarter with significant lower all- in sustaining costs.
Peter Jacobs: Yes. Well, thank you for the answer. But it's just – it's very hard to see with not only this quarter, but the last two quarters that pretty much everything that was outlined in January has failed to materialize. And I’m not talking about since you started your 2020 plan prior to that, I'm talking about how the execution has come about the last three quarters and the share price off 40% and you talk about building long-term value for the shareholders, where you’ve destroyed 40% of the value of the company over three quarters. So, understand that from an investor standpoint it does not reconcile at all?
David Garofalo: Yes. I don't find that premise for the simple reason that we’ve seen a significant compression in multiples across the entire sector this year. Yes, we've underperformed, but what I would also say is we significantly derisked the portfolio by delivering on our expansion plans and we've done so on time and on budget. In fact, the reason we had a poor third quarter is because we delivered the Pyrite Leach project ahead of schedule and we decided to prioritize low-grade material in our flagship mine and flip around the course, so we’re going to see in Q4 what we expected in Q3. So, it was the acceleration of that project that led to an unusually weak third quarter, it was supposed to be Q4. So, I'm very, very pleased with how our operating team and our project teams have delivered our projects, they are on time and on budget. We’ve executed very well, we’re derisking these projects and we are setting ourselves up for sustained higher production at sustained lower costs. I'm also very proud of the fact that we’ve run $250 million of efficiencies out of our business. Our costs would have been a lot higher with this lower production base without those efficiencies. And I’m also proud that we’ve been able to extend that program out another year another $100 million. We still see a lot of opportunities to bring efficiencies out of our business even as the industry itself has reached an inflection point in all-in sustaining costs, redundancy costs within our peer companies go up and we’re still going in the opposite direction in terms of our cost structure.
Peter Jacobs: Okay, I appreciate that. And tuning again in January and I hope we see some progress made on these fronts and thank you for going on the record on some of this. Thank you.
David Garofalo: Thank you for your question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Carey MacRury from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury: Hi. Just a question on Red Lake, you have talked about completing the transition of bulk mining, so I am just wondering in terms of throughputs and cost per ton going forward what we could expect there?
David Garofalo: Yes. As I said, we are essentially 100% long-haul stoping now and Red Lake as opposed to a lot of cut and field mining that was done in the past. I would tell you looking at it I would say very consistent throughputs with where we are today is our expectation with Red Lake. We have been working very hard to move, make that transition and get both of those mills full. Cost I think is an area that we have opportunities and we are continuing to look at driving those costs down, but I think this quarter is really reflective of what you would look at going forward in terms of tonnage for Red Lake, but again, we are going to be pleased to give you an update in January of how we see next year shaping up at Red Lake.
Carey MacRury: Okay. And then secondly on Peñasquito, you talked about the PLP project in the carbon pre-flotation plant is commissioned, just wondering what’s left to be commissioned there and is there risk if that’s late to impact Peñasquito production in the fourth quarter?
David Garofalo: So, what’s left to be commissioned there is essentially, CPP is fully functional operating for the PLP back end of it, we have essentially have had slurry through the entire plan. What’s left is to turn on the leach circuit there. We have done some of initial call it pre-commissioning of float sales, things are working, pumps are working everything is going through. So, again I think that we are very much on track. That’s a project that execution was some of the best I have ever seen, one of the safest executed projects I have seen and all of that discipline is translating over into our commissioning activities, so we are not very much on track with that and by the end of year we expect to have a fully commissioned and in commercial production.
Carey MacRury: So is that more later in the quarter or is there…
David Garofalo: Yes, obviously we think we towards the last part of the quarter is when we see this achieving the commercial production side of it, but again slurry is running through the plant today and it’s a matter right now of beginning the leaching circuit which we are prepared to do, not an issue everything is on track.
Carey MacRury: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes, good afternoon everybody. Two questions. One on the operations and the second is on the reserve, so may be Todd on the operations and again thanks a lot again for the Q4 details. Just wanted to circle back on the three mines, Peñasquito, Cerro Negro and Éléonore, just on Peñasquito where we have talked about the grade going back to the 0.42 grams per ton level, where you have touched on the recovery. I just want to know right now for the month of October how have we looked at throughput and grade at Peñasquito?
David Garofalo: What I would say Tanya is it’s very much aligned with the guidance that we have provided there. So we have come out of these stockpiles. We are feeding from both of the pits at this point in time and the plant is responding as we have indicated it would in the MD&A.
Tanya Jakusconek: So, we are back to the 0.42 grams per ton grade?
David Garofalo: That’s correct.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay and slightly higher throughput?
David Garofalo: Exactly and in line with what we said there, that’s true.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And what about longer term is are we looking at 112,000 tons per day at this operation, I think that’s what you filed in your technical study recently, is that still on plan?
David Garofalo: That is still very much in our plan. In fact we have got some work ongoing right now where we are identifying those opportunities that we are capitalizing on the opportunities that we see, so that is still very much in our plan for Peñasquito.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, good. That sounds good. Then maybe just moving on to Cerro Negro and I know Dave asked the question that we have the bump up in grade, maybe again how does the month of October look at Cerro Negro both tonnage and grade, some color on that, there is quite a big jump in grade and tonnage?
David Garofalo: It is absolutely. And actually this is an area that I think I am very pleased with where we are at. As I mentioned, we saw an immediate step change on October 1 against the Q3 tonnage.
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes.
David Garofalo: We’re seeing that mine jump up to into the 3,700 ton a day range from the mines themselves and the mill has had – has no problems whatsoever at that tonnage level. So, we’re very much on pace with what we put in – into the MD&A there.
Tanya Jakusconek: And what about the grade because we were at 10.75 grams per ton in Q3, we have to go close to 14 grams per ton in Q4. What's the grade looking like in October?
David Garofalo: Yes. The grade is on track in October. I want to say that the grades that really drive that come in late November and December as we transitioned back into some of the higher-grade stopes in the Mariana Central. But to-date, the grade is tracking well and we still see the opportunity for that overall implied 14 gram grade that, that the numbers would equate to.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So, we’re better than that 10.75 grams per ton, but not yet the 14 grams per ton. Is that a safe assumption?
David Garofalo: That would be a safe assumption, yes.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And if we were to go to Éléonore, how does November look for Éléonore, sorry, October, gotcha, which was in November, but October?
David Garofalo: Yes. Again, Éléonore is very much on pace with the numbers we provided here. Mining is – what I’m very pleased about with Éléonore is, they've got a number of – they’re about two months ahead of themselves in development on ore, which gives me a lot of confidence that they are more than capable of delivering that uplift in tonnage for Éléonore, things are going very well there. Plan is very much intact and month to-date, they are right on pace.
Tanya Jakusconek: And have we seen that pick-up in grade in October?
David Garofalo: We’ve seen grades consistent with where we planned to be, yes.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Okay, I’ll leave the mines, and maybe I can come to Paul, if I could. Just wanted to circle back on the reserves and resources, we were on the Éléonore Mine Tour, and I must say that we did talk about not replacing reserves at Éléonore that that’s fine.  We were expecting that, but I think from my thoughts, the decline in overall resources with the reserves I get a decline of about 2.7 million ounces, which was more than I had anticipated. So maybe Paul you can explain to me how your geological model interpretation has come in and maybe the drill spacing you’ve used to sort of move that downwards and are we looking to bring that back into the plan in the next few years?
Paul Harbidge: Yes. Tanya, if you remember from the visit, we completely redid the geological model building it from the face up with lithology structure, alteration and mineralization, and at the same time, we did some detailed statistical analysis on the drill hole densities. And with more rigor and discipline in the process of around our reserves and resources then based on that spacing we thought that it was prudent to downgrade some of that material. The deposits got from both the along strike and down and continues down that, we've got that – for that development is in the – and progress is being made and we've got recent results show that we’ve got strong mineralization at depths and as we advance the development we’ll be able to drill out more of the material to bring that back into reserve. And we’ve had an aggressive program on the grade of permit area as well building that portfolio of target. And actually, when you look at this new geological model and how robust it is then we’re getting very good reconciliation and it gives us more confidence in our mine plan and being able to deliver on our production profile.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. So, in terms of moving that material back, is this something that will take a few years to do?
Paul Harbidge: Yes. I mean, as we get the development in place and we drill up, we've got a systematic plan in place to be able to add that material back in as the years progress, and as I say we get that development in place to give us the access for the drilling.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. And then maybe just on Coffee, I know we chatted about the drill spacing declining from 70 meters, I think it was down to 40 meters for reserves definition, and you mentioned that there is the ability to further move into reserves almost a million ounces, I think that’s 600,000 ounces and 400,000 ounces in other categories. What’s the timeframe for that, I know you’ll do some of it this year, but…
Todd White: No, you are correct, Tanya. Again, it’s about getting that rigor and discipline into reserve and resource modeling. We also did that great control orientation study on a 5 by 5 pattern so that we could statistically workout what the spacing was and you are right, we are down to – we need to have the infill at 35 to 40, so again we felt it prudent that to downgrade some of the classification, but the overall ounce content remains the same. We are already into infill drilling. The aim is to finish that infill drilling program by June next year so that we would be able to report back in this time next year and having converted a portion of those resources back into reserve and we feel confident that we are going to have a mine plan based on more than 2 million ounces and we still got significant upside now with 5 new satellite deposits over 12 kilometers of untested gold in soil anomalism and multiple opportunities to add to that resource base.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, look forward to that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Alright. Good afternoon, Dave. I think you have got a record for most questions today. Just wondered thanks for the guidance on the way that the reserves are wanting to be grown over in the next couple of years, might have been helpful as we have been anticipating that analyst probably tend to look at straight line between where we are and the target in the absence of a bit of guidance. And with respect to the big additions in the aspirational big additions in 2020, 2021 from Caspiche and Norte Abierto, to what extent are those gold price related goals gold price affected given where gold is at the moment it would be pretty horrible as 12 lasted for another couple of years, but to what extent, would your growth plans be affected by a 1200 gold price?
Todd White: Yes, John, this is Todd. I guess what I would comment on that is these are – we are still in early pages on the studies and clearly gold price is one of the drivers, but clearly there is a lot of engineering work to be done and a lot of sort of project work to be done here to develop the absolute strongest business case we can or investment case on any of these projects. So, again at this point, I think it’s too early to say how it would be affected by gold, because we are very early in the project work, but certainly that is an element, but I don’t think it’s one of the key – one of the call it determining factors there. I think a lot of this is based on the work that we will do in the project. And again, our long-term price is certainly, I would agree with you, it would be horrible if it was 12, but our long-term prices is over that right now 12.50.
John Bridges: Okay. And you think that Caspiche would work at 12.50?
Todd White: Again, I think it’s early to say. I mean, we certainly are pursuing concepts on that, that we believe have an opportunity to convert that is yet to be seen, but it’s longer dated than that, but it’s a lot of study work and we will develop the strongest case we can at our pricing.
David Garofalo: And John what I would say this investment model worked very, very well for us in leveling the island in bringing what were really two marginal deposits back into strong economics by reducing our capital footprint by 30% to 40% and again consolidating the district and we are looking exactly to do the same thing with Norte Abierto. We are looking at one industrial complexes to the two as was contemplated when those deposits Casale and Caspiche were under separate ownership. And so I think the possibility of bringing that mineral endowment from resource and reserve has been improved significantly.
John Bridges: Yes. No, I can’t disagree with the concept. Many, thanks guys. Best of luck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Josh Wolfson from Desjardins. Please go ahead.
Josh Wolfson: Thank you. Taking a look at the Coffee acquisition and the context of several updates, where reserves and resources have successfully declined and the acquisition looks like it will result in a negative IRR for the company, how does the company look at its M&A evaluation going forward in the context of challenges like this that have materialized? And what’s – like what can be done going forward to sort of avoid these types of things?
David Garofalo: Well, actually, the investment thesis really hasn’t changed at all, Josh. We only pay for the proven and probable reserves at the time which admittedly have declined marginally since then, but we see a strong probability of a good chunk of that mineral resource of 1 million ounces being brought into the starter mine. It’s all oxide mineralization. And so we do expect the mine plan to more or less be in line and the grades haven’t declined in any significant fashion at all to be in line with what our original thesis was. We didn’t pay a dime for the resource nor do we pay a dime for any of the exploration upside, we still see immense potential within this district to add significant ounces.
Josh Wolfson: Okay. So, the numbers at reserves, it looks like they have gone from 2.2 to 0.7 and then on the resource side from 1.5 grams to sub 1. So I would say there looks to be a difference in what’s been reported at least thus far, but beyond that, what’s – maybe just plainly what’s the company’s perspective on M&A today and is there something that could be pursued in the next 12, 24 months?
David Garofalo: What I would say for M&A generally is when we have done it, we have created – we have improved the quality of our portfolio by selling assets that were lower in quality and adding assets that we thought added value and improve the quality for the overall portfolio and every mining company should be doing that. And we have been very judicious and systematic and measured in what we have done on the M&A side. So we are always open to upgrading the quality of our portfolio and we think we have done that by bringing Coffee and Norte Abierto in and exiting Felis and Camino Rojo and Cerro Blanco over the last couple of years and recycling that capital to improve quality, but also increase the net asset value of our business. And we are still very strong on the economic case for Coffee, really hasn’t changed in the least and we still see the potential for this to be even a larger mine plan that we originally contemplated in our due diligence.
Josh Wolfson: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Garofalo.
David Garofalo: Well, thank you everybody for your kind attention and of course if you have any other follow-up questions, please contact us individually.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was the result of a steady focus on meeting our commitments, to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient, to deliver two projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget, and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance. Turning to more details on slide 4, the first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,024 per ounce keeping us in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance, and we continued to improve costs and efficiency. I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian suite. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allowed the team at Merian to investigate and correct a problem that could have caused serious engine damage. The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects adding lower cost production in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world-class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance prefeasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio, and we had about 85 drill rigs operating around the world to advance brownfields and greenfields prospects. The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investor grade credit rating and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social, and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations. Turn to slide 5, while our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be and we've launched two initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery. Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures, and performing comprehensive risk assessments when tasks or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community. Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But as expected, our costs rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery, and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. Turning to production on slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and extensions into production, and 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we will reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas. Turning to our current projects on slide 8, we recently delivered two profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground on the 1st of July which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for $42 million, just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This extension adds higher grade, lower cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030. Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This extension adds lower cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with two autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills, and we've set up underground Wi-Fi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected. In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year and work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is ramping up and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami Power project which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These six projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20% helping to improve our outlook. Turning to slide 9. Newmont's five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth. However, we're beginning to see early signs that input costs including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates could put pressure on our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks. Turning to our latest investment in the future, on slide 10. This morning, we announced agreements to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek and to form a partnership with Teck who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in three stages; on completion of the prefeasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project. We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strength and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for prefeasibility studies over the next several months and manage the project through a joint steering committee. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy, on slide 11, to discuss our second quarter financial results.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Gary. Turning to slide 12 for the highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter, driven by lower sales volumes which were partially offset by higher realized gold price; adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share; and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017. Cash from continuing operations was $401 million compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments. Turning to slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share. Turning to capital priorities on slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector and we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global Ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018. And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations, starting on slide 15.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. Turning to North America on slide 16. As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we safely completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget, and we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to de-weight the slip in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore. At CC&V, production was impacted by lower leach recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months. In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. These will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018. Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins in the next layback of the mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects adding lower cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend the profitable production in North America. And finally, studies into the next phase for Long Canyon are continuing on course. Turning to South America on slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year. Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward, and our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian and we are starting to deliver further improvements. At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has helped offset slower leach recoveries, and we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower cost oxides over deep transitional ore. We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha Sulfides to reach definitive feasibility late this year. Turning to Australia on slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston Pit in mid-May. The mine detection systems identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit. However, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rights have been reduced and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between 290,000 ounces and 330,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall events and are engaged with the affected underwriters. The Mt. Charlotte underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally and the site is able to process stockpiled ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer term impacts including mine plan reevaluations. We have received the API permit for the Morrison layback and subject to the mine plan reviews still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year. At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with high production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize the mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018 and it will continue through 2019. At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil work for the power stations is well underway and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach. Turning to Africa on slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem, as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit costs increased due to high inventory cost driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between $890 and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance. Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and are in the process of slightly restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 Expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo mill expansion schedule will shift first gold into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the title capital estimate. Subika Underground continues to ramp up, and despite minor delays in constructing surface infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo Underground, and we progress the Akyem Underground project to prefeasibility. This mixed stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence. Turning to the rest of the year on slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering a highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. In summary, a global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged, and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018. Now, I hand it back to Gary on slide 21.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide 22, we continue to focus on operating and growing our business in four regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that will improve our margins, reserves, and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to slide 23, Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget, and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, and Quecher Main in Peru. Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook, but we remove from the pipeline at completion. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer term projects shown here in dark blue. This quarter, we advance Akyem Underground from scoping to prefeasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 – developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore process through the existing mill. Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a prefeasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to slide 24, this is our expected production profile for the next seven years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our guidance and the dark blue layer shows two longer term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and the Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage and we will maintain that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration. Turning to slide 25, in North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the prefeasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon and we plan to test eight different drill targets this year. Finally, we will begin scoping prefeasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over three to four years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru, and we're working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medellín and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish our presence and relationships in the country. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair land agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement. Putting it all together, on slide 26, we delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long-time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning all. Can you hear me, Gary?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you. So the gestation period for Galore continues. Do you want to share a little more on your thought process here, is it the (25:29) market, pricing, timing, the opportunities in jurisdiction. What were some of the real major thrusts to bring this all together and has this been on the plate for a while or did it happen recently, just a little more color towards the thought process here with Galore?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure thing. I think as we assess all things, we look for longer term value opportunities and I've been very clear we're looking for gold or copper gold potential. This is actually I think in the history of Newmont, probably the third time around that we've taken a look and this is an opportunity we think at fair value we've been able to acquire and we really like working with Teck. We worked and talked with them in the past. I think our value set and approach to operations and sustainability really come together quite well and just see this as a good opportunity. Clearly, we've got work to do. We've got a prefeasibility study that's going to take the next three to four years to work through with Teck and figure out what is the right way to develop this deposit and how to bring it forward and when to bring it forward. So there's more work to do, but we're excited about the potential both at the resource and working with our new partner, Teck.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think you said 83 rigs around the world that you're working on. As we look towards your reserve profile next year, where are some of the opportunities you're seeing some better results and more exciting results to help us achieve those goals?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I mean, I think we mentioned, including in the call here, we're seeing some good results at Yanacocha as we continue to look at both the sulfides and the oxide deposits. Tanami would be another area that looks exciting. I see some interesting results coming out of the Carlin area in terms of work we're doing there. Long Canyon, we continue to bring forward and the Ahafo Underground and, as I mentioned, the Akyem Underground's moved forward. We're seeing some good things there. So still we won't declare reserves changes till the end of the year, but we see ourselves on track towards that 4 million ounce reserve addition, at least that amount here this year.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And finally, Gary, as you assess cost pressures as you highlighted, have they accelerated from first quarter or from what you had anticipated a year ago, are they abating and where are maybe one or two areas that are really – I'm sure it's more regional than not, but that is more difficult to offset from Full Potential?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think clearly oil costs have affected the whole business, so that one I think everyone's got good transparency and we give some information on. Offsetting that, the Aussie dollar has dropped back down kind of in line with as gold price has come down. So it's down in the $0.74 to $0.75 range. We have seen some cyanide cost increases, and that's really input costs that go into the cyanide product that have been coming through. That's a little bit outside of what we would have had built into our plans. A little bit of labor. Really kind of keeping an eye on, as I said before, we watch where turnover is starting to pick up and we've seen a little bit in North America and in Australia, the labor markets heating up a bit, so we're keeping an eye on that. Nothing outside of what we at this stage had planned for, but it's one that I want to flag for the market as we go forward that we're keeping an eye on.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Excellent, Gary. Thank you for your thoughts.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Gary, everybody. Thanks for a drama-free set of results. Just following on from Mike's question on Galore, it had a pretty long development plan in some of the earlier feasibility studies with this long tunnel and whatever. I know it's early stage, but would you be sort of likely to be dribbling capital into that to shorten the development program and make it easier to make a decision when the copper price and the markets are receptive?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think – thanks for the question, John, and thanks for the comment on the lack of dramas. I think we wouldn't be trying to time a market. I don't think anyone's that good at this stage. What we would be doing is to really step back, take a good look at the work that's been done, a lot of good work has been done already, but then bring our heads together with the technical and social folks with Teck and work together with our team to come up with the best development plan. There's different options in terms of how to access and develop the resource, the several pits or potential pits that are there and we want to work through. So I don't want to preclude anything at this stage. I think we want to take a look with an open mind at all the options.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just perhaps as a follow-up, you mentioned the underground opportunities within Carlin. What's your vision for that large land package you got there, because if you simply look at the reserve base in Carlin, then it's one of the shorter life assets on a sort of production versus reserve basis. But then, given the underground opportunities you found already and the ones that you have a sense that could be there, then you could be mining there for a long time.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think and as you've seen, Carlin has been in operation for over 50 years, we have a pretty good resource and mineral inventory base that we're pretty confident, as we continue to better understand some of the geology and structure around there, that we could add primarily from an underground standpoint, as I see it, but I spent time – I was out there last week really at all the operations and feel comfortable in terms of extensions around Carlin. Long Canyon, we continue the development of Phase 2. Some interesting things around Emigrant that we're taking a look at. So as we use both current technology and continue to extend the use of our deep sensing geochemistry to better understand things that may be covered at depths that we haven't actually looked at, most of what's been discovered today has had some sort of a surface exposure or been accidentally found by a water well or something. So I think using this technology to try to discover as yet unfound deposits, I think, has good potential in Nevada.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Good luck and thanks again for the results.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary, Nancy and Tom. I was actually admiring the core that you've got on page 26 from Tanami. Very impressive bit of VG (32:42) there. Just going over to Ahafo, so you're now pushing the commercial startup, it looks like it would be delayed by as much as a quarter given unfortunately the circumstances early this year. But the CapEx is maintained for 2018. Can you see some sliding of the CapEx from 2018 into 2019?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I have Tom address that.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Thanks, David. What we're able to do following the shutdown at the construction work on site, David, as we worked through that incident and the appropriate recovery from that, is still quite a bit of offsite work going on, so lot of fabrication and procurement works too going on and that was able to help us minimize the impact of schedule. So we're still seeing a similar spend profile in this year as a consequence of that. So there will be a little bit of flow of our capital into next year as a result of the cessation of construction activity on site, but as I say, a lot of offsite work was able to continue through that time period.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: And you're thinking we should be looking at commercial production more in Q4 of next year than in Q3 or Q2?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: At this stage, I just keep it to the second half and we were very much in the process of remobilizing now. So as we get back into construction activities proper, then we'll be out to reassess the various work fronts and then understand and refine that schedule. So I'd keep it a second half at this stage.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. To Kalgoorlie, so guidance this year down 70,000 ounces impact into next year as a consequence of that east wall slip. Can you just walk us through what the implications are for the mining with, I presume, a restricted footprint of access and remedial work, and what it means for the layback of Morrison and the timing of that?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David. I'll keep going with the answer to that question. So with the slip on the east wall that took out the ramp on the east wall of that pit. So, that was the ramp we're planning to use for the Morrison layback that we were bringing forward. So as we work through the reassessment of Morrison, it will be how we can mine a smaller Morrison and not rely upon that ramp on the east wall. Now, as we work through our longer term plans looking at our – lot of the work today was about safely understanding the impact of that slip and understanding the impact for this year, so work's still underway in terms of the longer term impact and the various scenarios around that. A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we'll do on that better east wall and how we might lay back that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we'll need to do to better inform that approach. So, that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and then understand the longer term impacts beyond 2018 and then how we access the greater Morrison resource, but we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit and there's some material on the western wall as well that we'll be de-stacking that's been sitting underneath the west wall slip and we'll continue to process stockpiled ore through the mill. So the processing plants, the two – well, the three processing plants at KCGM are still running at full rates and in fact they're running at rates that we haven't seen since 2005. So we're maximizing the processing through the plant to minimize the impact from this slip.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: The strip CapEx there was going to be about $125 million spread over a number of years, 2018 through to 2025 basically and getting production access to Morrison in 2019. Should we be pushing that out by a year or two do you think?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: We'll have a – I'm anticipating having a smaller Morrison this year. How big that is and what the spend will be, we're still working through. So we need some more time to work through that process. So we'll need to come back to you at a future date with some more information there, David.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Thanks, David. And reminder, you get an opportunity to see first-hand that core from Tanami if you visit in November that we've got planned with investors.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Very nice.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And just a follow-up on David's question if I might, maybe is it reasonable to look at KCGM as for the next couple of years, anyway is maintaining sort of your share of production at the 280,000 to 300,000 ounce a year range that is looking at the stockpiles, lower grades and the other sources of work to basically sustain that at these levels. Is that a safe assumption when we look at our model for KCGM?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, I think at this stage, Stephen, as we continue as Tom described the planning work that's going on, I think that's a good starting point and we'll give further update most likely when we give our full year guidance for 2019 at the end of this year.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And then just a separate question on CC&V. Tom, you made the reference to that you shipped about 17,000 tonnes (sic) [ounces] of con to the Carlin plant. I guess the question is on a quarterly run rate basis, what should we assume and is that concentrating – is that concentrate displacing roaster ore as it is a lower grade roaster ore and should we see an improvement in what comes out of the roasters in Carlin as you ship more material from CC&V?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. I just might clarify that was 17,000 ounces of gold that we shipped in a 30,000 sitting stockpiled. You will certainly see – there's two things. That stockpiled ore will start to – stockpiled concentrate will start to move through the third and fourth quarter. We'll stockpile them because we had to do some improvements to a county road that are now complete, so we're ramping up shipments as we speak and we are now commissioning the cleaner concentrate circuit that will produce a higher grade particularly in sulfur coming out of the CC&V plant, so that gold and sulfur will go into Mill 6, so it provides a heat source that allows us to put higher grade Carlin ore through Mill 6, so we will see some benefit at Carlin as a result of that fuel source that comes from that concentrate. We are still very much on target to hit our guidance for CC&V, so if you just look at first half and extrapolate to where we're predicting guidance to be for the year, you can get a measure of the impact of shipping that concentrate to Nevada is going to have on CC&V gold production for the full year and in particular the second half.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Perfect. And then presumably extend that into 2019, 2020 as well?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's right. That process of sending concentrate to Nevada will continue in the future years.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you very much for that, Tom. That's all my questions.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, everybody. I guess David asked my questions on the Morrison layback, and just to make sure I understood, so by year-end, we will have some sort of an idea when you put out your guidance, I guess, in December. What the sort of smaller Morrison layback looks like just with the – getting back to the ramp access that you right now don't have, is that a clear – am I understanding it correctly?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. That's correct, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. So I'll leave that one. And maybe I can come back to two other things. One is just back on Galore Creek. Just wanted to understand, Gary, you said this is the third time you've looked at this. Coming back to it a third time, was it – there is a willing seller right now, was it just a willing seller? And how did you come up with the valuation on the purchase price, was it based on dollar per ounce in the ground, was it based on a discounted cash flow? I'm just trying to understand how you put value on this.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Well, little bit of all of the above. And it was about a year ago that we began dialog with the group and have worked through our view on what the value of the deposit is at this stage and then went through the normal sort of commercial negotiation that you go through to reach commercial terms and we staged it. So as we move forward and get better confidence in it, it's tied back into us gaining greater confidence in the future and how it would be developed. So, that didn't come all at once. We worked through that as we worked through the prefeas and then feasibility studies.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. So is it safe to say that it's been a year that you've been working on this and you've looked at all of the studies out there and somewhere between looking at the studies and valuation on per ounce in the ground is how you came up with your purchase price for unstaged (43:01) payments?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes, that's correct.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just coming back to Akyem, I noticed that you put a press release on your website with regards to some contention with farmers around the area and some compensation. Can you just give us an update of what's exactly happening there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. I'm going to hand over to Tom to cover that.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. And thanks, Tanya, for the question. We're working through a process where some local residents raised some concerns over payment of ground and crop compensation that dates back to before the mine started and then having some issues around mine-related impact. So everything we're doing is consistent with what we're required to do and in terms of the agreements we've had in place. But we've been involved in good faith dialog with community leaders, with the people who are raising these concerns and working through a mediation process to reach a form of resolution there with them. And that process has been progressing over a period of time. What you saw in more recent times is the group which we're quite comfortable with stage a demonstration to further support their claim. So, that took place, a peaceful demonstration over a few hours a couple of days ago. So the activity was related to that. But we continue to engage in good faith dialog to reach a resolution with those people who are raising those concerns.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: And when is the mediation? Do you have a timeline for the mediation process?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's been ongoing and we will continue to work through that process until we can reach a resolution. There isn't any fixed deadline, but we remain ready, willing and able to sit down and discuss these issues with them.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: So besides the peaceful demonstration that you had the other day, is that really the only sort of demonstration you've had on this site with respect to these farmers and their crops?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Going back in terms of my memory and it's – yes, that would be the case.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And we've seen nothing like this at Ahafo in that area?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: We haven't seen demonstrations on these particular issues at Ahafo, but we do see from time to time demonstrations over different issues that we need to work through with the community and the community leaders to manage and understand those issues. So it's not unusual in Ghana to see the community demonstrate as part of a process of talking through their issues.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. We'll continue to monitor it. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, Gary. Maybe a question for yourself; and Randy, just coming back to Galore again, I know there's been a few questions, but I still haven't quite heard from you because here's a project that Teck basically mothballed many years ago, never heard much about it and then now it's come back to life again. Just wondering where Teck – or sorry, Newmont, I guess Teck also, see the opportunity to improve the economics of the project that could lead to a positive feasibility studies or attractive returns, I guess, that's what I was wondering.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think as you look in Teck's published information, they've got it out there as a longer term opportunity. We see it in a similar manner and one that we'll work together to see if we can improve on the valuation. I'm going to see if Randy wants to add anything to that.
Randall E. Engel - Newmont Mining Corp.: Mike, I think there's – this project, there is opportunities to look at the things like the tunnel, the access opportunities, I think phased mine planning, plant design optimization, all of those opportunities with taking two quality partners like Teck and Newmont working together, it really could create some substantial value above and beyond what's been looked at so far. I think there is good opportunity to define the upside further on the ore body and the resource.
Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Does this kind of signifies Newmont's acquisition strategy, focusing on more longer term development projects rather than assets in production?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, I think that fits with what we've been saying to the market, what we went through at our Investor Day, really looking at earlier stage opportunities that we can bring in either through our own exploration or through partnering with different parties and bringing those forward. That doesn't mean we won't look at operating assets, much like we did with CC&V a few years ago, if we can obtain them at fair value.
Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Well, thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Gary, are you getting a better sense around the Chaquicocha Oxides and how that fits in between now and Yanacocha Sulfides and how that fits in potentially with Quecher Main?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, at this stage, Quecher Main is progressing well. We hope to see some initial production there later this year. And that's actually doing quite well. We were down there last month visiting. The Oxides is yet to be included in any of our plans. So it'd be something as we put our plans and give our forecasts later this year for 2019 on out that we'd look to include the Oxides, but we continue to see good potential for both the north and the south Chaqui Oxides as we continue to drill and get a better handle on that. So, that would be in addition to what we've already provided in guidance and something that we'll present later this year.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Quecher Main is a couple of hundred thousand ounces a year and bridges you to Yanacocha Sulfides, this would be over and above that in terms of incremental production.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's the right way to look at it, Greg.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Any sense of potential there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We'll come out with that later this year when we give guidance.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. Not to belabor Galore Creek too much, but obviously over the last few years there has been a tremendous amount of uncertainty caused by resource nationalism and obviously Galore Creek safe jurisdiction in British Columbia. To what extent did that play a role in evaluation of this asset and the strategic decision to invest there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think as you look, we've got a footprint that's in four jurisdictions that allows us to take a look at potential opportunities in all those four jurisdictions. Canada being one and we think this is a good – it's one of the elements clearly, Lucas, that we do consider when we look at opportunities. So, that was one of the elements.
Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: But it's not – I shouldn't read it as a pivot more towards safe jurisdictions you continue to feel comfortable, kind of where you are or do you think maybe the center of gravity could shift a little bit over the coming years.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think we continue to go where the best assets and the best potential profile is. An example is the Medellín office that we've just opened up in Colombia. We see that as a strategic toehold there towards what we see as an improving situation there and something that looks good. Much like we saw Peru 20 years ago, we see Colombia. So I wouldn't say we're rushing in any certain direction, we're going where it makes sense.
Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. And then on Galore Creek, do you think that the project is more valuable with Teck as a partner or do you think it could maybe make sense for you to go ahead by yourselves?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No, I think our view is working alongside Teck makes good sense there.
Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Lucas.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you for joining our call this morning. Newmont delivered solid second quarter results. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, in line with our full year guidance. We delivered two profitable projects, established strategic partnerships and invested in an exciting growth opportunity in British Columbia. We also declared an industry-leading dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to provide more information on our environmental, social and governance performance and our goals for the future. We look forward to maintaining a momentum in the second half and continuing to lead the gold sector and profitability and responsibility. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in Newmont.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Newmont's first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Jess, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building seven profitable projects on four continents, and we advanced the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in six fatalities. Turning to slide 4. As a background, construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7 when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful. And six men, whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our regional leadership team in reaching out to their families, our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences. We have assembled an expert investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened. Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident so we could review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and Akyem are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill Expansion has been suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important. Turning to more details on the quarter on slide 5, we continue to deliver our strategy, starting with superior operational execution. This includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce, in line with guidance and continuing to improve cost and productivity through our full potential program. For instance, we're launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance. We also continued to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks Underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our near-mine exploration programs, as well as promising greenfields prospects on four continents. We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter, declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly three times higher than the first quarter of 2017, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our Sustainability Report, Beyond the Mine, which is posted on our website. Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our cost rise temporarily in 2018, as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment in exploration and projects, in keeping with our focus and creating long-term value. Cost will come back down, as we reach higher grades and bring on new lower cost production at Subika Underground later this year. Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance and we continue to improve cost and efficiency, by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability. Turning to production on slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018 and we're on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter. As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year when we'll recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa and bring the Subika Underground Project online. Turning to more on our current projects on slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial production at the Subika Underground later this year and we've begun to restart construction work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion as we perform detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved. In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek & Victor for processing in our Nevada mills in early 2018 and Tom will have more on our results to-date. In South America, Quecher Main is well underway. This project is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami Power project, which will lower cost and emissions and facilitate future growth. These six projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20% helping to improve our outlook. Turning to slide 9. Newmont's five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We've not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks. Turning to our longer term growth prospects on slide 10. Our ability to pursue growth on four continents is a distinct competitive advantage and one that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and project experience and strong regional relationships. In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin. We're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha Sulfides projects and have included a new project, Chaquicocha Oxides that Tom will review in more detail. We're partnering with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early-stage exploration property in French Guiana. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Gary. Turning to slide 12 for first quarter financial highlights. Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million. Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects. Turning to slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs and a $0.02 loss primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share. Turning to capital priorities on slide 14, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.4 times. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter. Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend plus the share buyback program executed in the first quarter of this year, we're on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy. And now, I'll hand it over to Tom for discussion of our operations starting on slide 15.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. Turning to Africa on slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people, starting with those who lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion and extending to our team who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We're working to understand what went wrong, so that we can make sure it never happens again. Not only at Newmont, but in the broader mining community. Turning to operational performance. Both Ahafo and Akyem delivered strong results in the first quarter. This is largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement, representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana Mineworkers Union. The Subika Underground continues on course. We're currently developing our seventh stope and expect to reach commercial production later this year, driving outlook for an even stronger second half. And we approved funding for definitive feasibility studies at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing the project, securing permits and engaging stakeholders. Finally, we continue to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem. Turning to North America on slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and stope design has allowed us to ramp-up production, with improved development rates and higher grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar pit and expect to reach ore later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We're processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek & Victor and seeing higher than expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter, as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6. CC&V's production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full-year cost to improve, with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher than expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada. At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold zones in 2018 and we'll shift to higher grade copper zones beginning in 2020. Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher costs for 2018. This is result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage geotechnical issues and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the Mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts and our North America production outlook remains unchanged. Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus later this year and Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way for potential production by 2024. We also recently executed a purchase agreement with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly prospective district. Turning to South America on slide 18. Merian continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity And we commenced mining in the Maraba pit, providing high grade separate light ore (00:15:16) to the mill. Our primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock. Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration at Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we do not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized or blending strategies at the gold mill. Stripping has begun at Quecher Main and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha where we are dividing two underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit. You can see this shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage and we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha Sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter, and we continue our work to optimize our technical approach. Turning to Australia on slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from four to three. This change delayed some production in the first quarter, but we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach high gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets. We're also re-sequencing our mine plant at KCGM as we take a considered approach to remediating the west wall slip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we have reduced our production outlook for 2018 by 40,000 ounces. Despite this short-term setback, we're well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our full potential program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance and we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion. We've started raise bore drilling a pilot hole to guide our approach to sinking a shaft that will allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a funding decision on the project in the second half of 2019 and for construction to take around two years. And finally, we have begun construction on the Tanami Power Project which involves building a pipeline and two power stations that will allow us to switch from diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019 and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%. Looking to the remainder of 2018 on slide 20, our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged, despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back-half weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve our highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we're on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, costs and productivity at our operations and projects. With that, I'll hand it back to Gary on slide 21.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 22. Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near-mine growth prospects. Turning to slide 23, our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power Project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability. Turning to slide 24. Here's a look at our production profile over the next seven years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations, as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our guidance and the dark blue layer shows two longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage as does our leading reserve profile. Turning you to slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid-off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per thousand shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped sustain top quartile total shareholder return since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. Summing it all up on slide 26, our performance in the first quarter was strong but indelibly marked by the six fatalities our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and recommit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Gary and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is probably for Nancy. Just in terms of the working capital moves during that quarter, do we think about those as a one-off for this year or is there something to look for in the other quarters?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. Great question and just a reminder, we don't give guidance on free cash flow. I would think of it more of timing differences and a couple of drivers for that is really timing of shipments created a bit of an AR build at both Merian and Phoenix. There was also a bit of build on leach pads and con inventory as we prepare to ship from CC&V over to Nevada. And then, in this particular quarter, there was a bit of timing around accounts payable just mostly at North America and Boddington. So I would consider those to be just a bit of anomalies for this particular quarter.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Nancy. And just maybe this one's for Tom, in terms of the maintenance during 2Q, you talked a bit about Mill 6 at CC&V. Can you just run through the other operations and the impact on the production in 2Q specifically that you've allowed for as a result of that? Thanks.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Chris. The major maintenance work, it's our annual – every second quarter we do the annual shutdown on Mill 6. So that's typically a three-week shutdown and so that's the major maintenance impact on production at across the business in the second quarter. Now, Mill 6 is now taking concentrates from CC&V. So again, you'll see the impact in terms of stockpiling some of those concentrates and then they'll come through the mill as we come out of that shutdown. So just commenced that shutdown and it runs for about three weeks.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then, just in terms of the overall M&A environment at the moment, has anything changed there? You've obviously got a great pipeline of organic opportunities. But are you looking at anything on the other divestment or investment side outside of the organic opportunities?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No. I think, Chris in terms of – as you put it, we've got a great pipeline of organic projects and we really remain focused on those. We do continue to scan the horizon and look at things and kick the tires as we've done over the years. CC&V having been the only one that we actioned over the last five years. We'll continue to look but really see the production and the potential of the projects we have and from the exploration work that we do. And we're focusing on some of these earlier stage areas like I mentioned in my comments in South America, in Africa, in North America, and in Australia. And we keep focusing on those.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Gary. Then the last one for me is just the talk about Northern Territory and the royalty hike. Have you got any thoughts on that? I think it's reasonably small but just some comments if you don't mind.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think I'll hand that one over to Nancy. I think, I mean, it's been talk primarily in Western Australia that has been where the focus has been. We've been through a couple of rounds. Our key focus has been on getting the facts out in terms of what the true impacts are on royalties and working with other gold producers in that region. In regards to Northern Territory, I'll hand over to Nancy where that's at.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. We have been watching that one very carefully. There have been movements in that area from a legislative perspective and our tax department and our gov-rel people, as well as our operations people have been very closely tied to that. We understand generally the thinking around a royalty-based profit or an ad valorem-based, either of which we've evaluated and have considered the impacts on our plan. So as we build our business plan into 2019, we'll figure out the best way to incorporate those and that will also be represented in our guidance that we gave later this year. We don't expect significant changes, but we are certainly watching that and will reflect our guidance as appropriate.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks for all the answers.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you very much for the update. My first question, maybe it's for Tom, if you don't mind. Chaquicocha, what's required to get that into production from what you can see now?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David. So I don't know if you can still see slide 18 in your deck. But as we have drifted -- we drifted in underneath that pit exploration drifts to understand and define the sulfides deposit. But the exploration drifts we sized as production drifts. So we have that capacity there. So now, as we'd identified and defined that oxide deposit, those exploration drifts will enable us to further define those. And then we'll have – as through the exploration drift (00:29:30) to that mine infrastructure and ready them up to develop the stopes and mine that ore. So exploration drifts provides some of that infrastructure. The upsides then provide a further bridge from Quecher Main to the sulfides. That ore is mill grade, so it can process through our current mill at Yanacocha. And the work we do to bring it on will actually provide synergies in terms of infrastructure for underground sulfides at the Chaquicocha.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: So having a look at slide 18, you're referring there to the blobs called South Oxide, I presume. So it's hard to tell where it's sitting relative to the pit, but it's accessible only by underground, you wouldn't be able to lay-back the pit?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: We certainly looked at those options, but the one we're taking a pre-feas is to access those through underground mining, through the exploration drifts you can't see in that picture that are sitting in underneath that deposit. And then, the little blobs you see on the north side is where we're drifting out to further explore those. So we're pretty excited about what that might present over the coming months as well.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Just a higher level question here. Looking at your development CapEx guidance for the year, it's around about $600 million. Your run rate for the first quarter was well below that. Is there either, A, a big catch-up for the balance of the year or is there a risk of some of that CapEx sliding into 2019? And is there any implication of that lower spend in the first quarter on the delivery of the various projects that we see in the pipeline.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I'll let Tom cover that.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David. The run rate is predominantly driven by our spend on Tanami Power. So you'll see that as we've got pipe being delivered, we're into the right season now in the Northern Territory. We'll have – I think it's five work fronts sinking that pipe. You'll see that's been increased as we start to construct both the pipeline and the power stations at Tanami.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And back to Nancy, Chris had asked about the working cap and thank you for the answer. But just so that I understand it, can we expect an unwind of some of that $350 million incurred this quarter through the balance of the year?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Some of that will begin to unwind for sure.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Right.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Again, we don't give guidance on free cash flow, so it's kind of hard to give you a view as to exactly how that will unwind. But we'll try to provide some transparency to that as the year goes on.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: Yes. Good morning, everybody. I've got a few questions, probably for Tom, on the technical side. Tom, the Morrison decision on the timing there, I thought we were supposed get an update with that in Q1. What's going on with Morrison?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tanya. So Morrison, we're scheduled to start that lay-back in the fourth quarter. We had talked previously about approving it in the first quarter, but we made a decision to combine the final permits for Morrison, with some other permits associated with the road out to the tailings facility into a single application. That's now with the government and being processed and we'd expect to see that permit come through probably in the third quarter, in line with starting that lay-back on schedule in the fourth quarter.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: Okay. Okay. Thank you. So, it's just being put into another permit and moving forward. It's still on the same timeline.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's correct. That's correct.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: And then, maybe just looking – and I appreciate and sorry to hear about the fatalities of the miners in Ghana and obviously number one focus is safety and making sure that everything is in line to reopen safely. Can you just let us know what exactly is being done at the Ahafo Mill Expansion and at what point, if we're down for a while, do we start slipping in the schedule?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Tanya. So our focus over the last two weeks, as I talked about is really making sure that we're providing support to the families impacted by the tragic accident and ensuring that our teams are getting the support they need to ensure that they are focused on doing the work safely.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: Yeah, of course.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: In terms of the mill expansion itself, the status of it, this accident happened in around the civil construction and we're about 70% through that work for the project and very much moving into the structural, mechanical piping phase of the project. So that's the status of the project. We're reasonably well-advanced and if you recall commercial production's in the second half of next year. So we're going through a process, as we look to ramp up, of inductions, refreshers and doing robust risk assessments on all the work fronts we have across that project as we bring it up to speed. And then, we'll assess what impact that ultimately has on the timetable. But into the structural, mechanical piping stage of the project and second half of next year for commercial production.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: And is there any point at which if we're down and of course, safety is number one in making sure that mine can come up safely. Is there a point in time that if we are not up and running, let's say, by Q3 or Q4 of this year that we slipped. I just don't know the timeline in term of slippage.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tanya. So the Ahafo surface mines and the existing mill at Ahafo were all back up and running 24 to 48 hours after the accident. The Subika Underground was up and running in the similar timeframe. So the Ahafo operation is running as per normal. So this is really then the extension to the mill. And we're working – as I say, we're working through that process. As Gary said in his talk we're actually working through those restart activities and risk assessments now. We're not anticipating any change to our guidance as we work through this process.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: Okay. And then, maybe my last question and you mentioned that we have the roaster down for maintenance for three weeks in Q2. Is it safe to assume that Q2 operationally may be just a bit slightly weaker than Q1, because of the downtime at the roaster and then, obviously, picking up into Q3 with a strong operational quarter for Q4? Is that how you see the year panning out?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think that's pretty reasonable, Tanya. It's certainly going to see it pretty flat through the second quarter, yet cost will be up because of the maintenance work. You'll start to see Q3 come up a bit. But certainly going to be Q4, as we get into the – we actually get the Subika Underground starts to ramp up, but you will be into the Silverstar or into higher grades at Merian.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets: Okay. And then, what Nancy said, the unwinding of the working capital adjustment will help with the free cash flow generation. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: (00:37:13).
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.: Hi, good morning.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good morning.
Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.: You've moved Long Canyon Phase 2 into the prefeasibility stage. I'm just wondering at a high-level, can you talk about what you're targeting there in terms of production level and potential mine life?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I'll hand over to Tom. Usually, we don't get into the big details at this stage until it moves a little further along, but I'll have Tom cover where we stand with that.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Thanks, Gary and Carey. As Gary said, we're still in the fairly early stages of this study. Just moving into pre-feas and the project is really about extension of the open pit moving into underground and moving below the water table. So a key part of the pre-feasibility study work is working with the various state and national agencies to advance our water models and do the field work associated with understanding the impact of de-watering. So it's really at that stage as we work through probably, that work over this year and into next year. If that all proceeded well, you'd be looking at starting, stripping in 2021 and moving through to 2024 and your first production would be after 2024 and we're looking to line it up as we come out of the current Phase 1 that that would then be a seamless transition into Phase 2.
Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.: So is it more about maintaining Phase 1 production levels or is production expected to go up?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: At that stage, I'd be saying it's probably more maintaining the current levels. But we're still – it's early stages in the pre-feas. We've got a fair bit of work to do on understanding that whole water balance.
Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.: Okay. And then, secondly on Ahafo North, you've completed the pre-feas on that. Just a similar question, is there any details you can share on that?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. So really as we move into definitive feasibility, it's really about now optimizing on that project as we move forward for full funding. We're looking at around an annual production of 250,000 ounces out of a standalone mine. It's about 30 kilometers northeast of the existing operations. We've got about 3.3 million ounces of reserves and around 1 million ounces of resource. We're looking at a 13-year mine life and investment in the range of $750 million. And we're working towards a decision in the second half of next year and around about a three-year development schedule.
Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you all for joining our call this morning and I appreciate the questions. Newmont had some solid first quarter results. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $973 per ounce in line with guidance. We advanced profitable projects and exploration projects on four continents and we increased our dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet. But we also experienced a terrible loss. Please join me in keeping the families of our fallen colleagues in your prayers and in renewing your commitment to work safely above all else. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect the line.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Newmont Full-Year and Quarter Four 2017 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corporation: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Newmont's full-year and fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer-term value creation. Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all cost, capital, and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on four continents and demonstrating that leading financial, social, and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand. Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on slide 4, highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining costs at $924 per ounce with support from our Full Potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results. Increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added a first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest where it adds the greatest value. We also strengthened our global portfolio of long-life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely on-time and on-budget, advancing five projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base, and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana, and across the Andes. Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile, and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. I'll expand on that topic on slide 5. We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017, we also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks, which, along with training, helped keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards. As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 and the previous five years, but the same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. It was an honor to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017 and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's top 250 best managed companies. Newmont was also ranked as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in the areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management, and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. Our teams also differentiated by their project delivery record. Turning to slide 6. Over the last three years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on-time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region. In North America, we approved the Twin Underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground mine which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led to the government extending tax and royalty stability for another five years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. And most recently in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power Project to lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground, and Subika Underground this year. The six projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook. Turning to slide 7. Our five year guidance reflects cost and production improvements from our Full Potential work, as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. Covering the highlights, our costs are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo, and Twin Creeks, then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations. Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance. And we expect to improve production and operating costs in the outer-years through projects that have not yet been approved. We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and 2019 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power Project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimization Project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options. Turning to slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin. And we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon. In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. And positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha where we added resources in 2017. We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions. Turning to slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold prices the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million ounces were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the IFC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions were primarily in North America and Australia, and our resource additions were spread more equally across our four regions. Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington; 800,000 ounces at Carlin Underground and Cripple Creek & Victor; 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge; 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines; and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these exceptional results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend, and balance sheet. Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on slide 11. Compared to the prior-year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion. And this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We increased adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million. I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impact Newmont in just a moment. Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation and remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets, and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see the adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. We also delivered exceptional results for the full year. Turning to slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increased adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share and we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion. Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion. Turning to adjustments to full year earnings per share on slide 14, here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of a $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investment; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. These results help Newmont maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector. Turning to slide 15. We've worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our three capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improve margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013, and in the fourth quarter further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3 times. Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend. Turning to slide 16. In December, we announced plans to de-link our dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least 50%. Earlier this week we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly three times higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. $0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North American senior gold producer average of approximately a 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns while continuing to invest in profitable growth. In addition to approving a dividend increase, our board of directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year. Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover four primary aspects here. First, we expect to reduce income tax rate to benefit our North America operations, starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and costs. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont. In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. There are, however, two one-time non-cash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Re-measurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses. And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights starting on slide 18.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. We delivered solid performance in 2017, while continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore-body modeling, mine planning and execution, increasing mill-throughput and recovery, and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us to deliver more than $400 million in Full Potential improvements, and offset the things we don't control including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events. Turning to North America on slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining cost below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stope design, allowing us to ramp-up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus and you can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and we'll reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019. At Twin Creeks, we mine the first production stope at our new underground mine one month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a four-year layback in the Mega Pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally planned to mine this layback through the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned. We signed a new seven-year toll milling agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks Sage autoclaves, and approve funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimization Project. The project centers on sinking a production shaft that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit and improve production rates and unit costs when it comes online in 2022. At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course and we expect to complete the Environmental Impact Statement process over 2018 and 2019. Turning to South America on slide 20. Our operations turned the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce. Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched Full Potential with an initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our new primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year. At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieved its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed at Quecher Main and we've begun stripping in the mine. And we continue to advance at Yanacocha sulfide studies. Turning to Africa on slide 21. The region continued to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we're beginning a layback of our existing Subika surface mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional leach tanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stope at the Subika Underground mine and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs rose as expected in the second half of 2017. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. Turning to Australia on slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion safely, on budget, and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stope design, resulting in high grades and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity. At KCGM, we continue to remediate a slip in the west wall of a Fimiston Pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2019. We delayed approval timing so we can combine two permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule. We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter of this year, and to deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput four times in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in the south pit. Mine plan optimization of Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. We've also approved a new project of Tanami to support continued expansion. Turning to slide 23. Our Tanami Power Project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel which is trucked to site, by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We have contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and two onsite power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. A capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers at least that will be paid over 10-year period and the project is expected to generate an internal rate of return greater than 50%. Looking to the year ahead on slide 24. The 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit costs and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing Full Potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and plant maintenance shutdowns result in second half weighting with our highest production and lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year, and execute our annual plant maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. We then expect to ramp-up production in the third quarter as we begin to process Silverstar ore and reach high grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with Subika Underground coming online and both South American operations reaching higher grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine. With that, I'll hand it back to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 26, Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our new mine growth prospects. Turning to slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and the capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada; Morrison and the Tanami Power Project in Australia; the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill expansion in Ghana; and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance the execution in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins. Turning to slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next seven years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance. The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our current guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the two long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance. Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and a robust project pipeline represented distinct competitive advantage as does our leading reserve profile. Turning to slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. At the same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per thousand shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia. Another distinction is that our mined grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and positioned the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon. Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple, just in terms of slide 27 that you show each quarter. Given a number of the projects are now in the execution phase and if you think about the last couple of years the major acquisition you've done is CC&V. Do you think you have – are you comfortable with the mix of organic opportunities from here or do you think that you maybe need to look inorganically at other opportunities or JVs at this point given you've obviously progressed a number of the early (30:12) options already?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks for that Chris. I think, as you look, we do have a number that are in execution, so making sure we get those across the line efficiently, safely, and on budget is important. So if you look at the others, the two that I pointed out, Yanacocha Sulfides, Tanami Expansion 2, I'd see progressing this year into the next stage over to the right, likewise with Ahafo North, as we continue development on those projects. And those are some pretty substantial projects when you look at the size and the potential capital of those. So good focus there. But I think, more importantly, and that's kind of where you're getting to is on the far left, the greenfield side and where we are working with the team at Continental in Colombia to progress that project, and make a decision on whether we want to continue with that investment or not later this year or early next year, our greenfields efforts in French Guiana, efforts in the Yukon and in Australia, so a number of different projects. And I'll hand over to Tom to see if he's got a couple more to add into that mix.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: I'd also add. Thanks, Gary. If you look at some of the opportunities under conceptual and scoping, there's still some real prospects particularly in around the Ahafo Underground that we need to pursue and the Carlin district and the underground potential around there is still very prospective. So it's really about making sure we continue to do our work to bring those opportunities forward. And as I mentioned in my notes, Long Canyon is we're only in Phase 1, so the opportunity is to continue to progress Long Canyon on the Eastern part of Nevada.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: So, clearly, in summary, Chris, our focus is on the organic pipeline that we have. We've got a very strong organic pipeline. We'll continue to kick the tires, so to speak, on other assets. But as you've seen over the last several years, the only one we did that made sense and added value for our shareholders was CC&V.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Gary, Tom. And in terms of the Yanacocha Sulfides, so can you just step through the main timeline there or what we should be expecting over the next couple of years?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. I'll hand that one over to Tom to cover.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. So we're – over the course of this year, we expect – or at the very end of this year, late this year to commence feasibility studies and we wouldn't be looking to get to a decision to proceed until the latter part of 2019. We really see that that piece of work is the first phase and that first phase is the opportunity to extend Yanacocha's operational life out to 2039 with annual gold equivalent production because there's a lot of copper as well as gold in the sulfide deposit. We're looking at extending that life out to about 2039 of about 350,000 ounces per year and we're still looking at around about the $2 billion mark for that project.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Tom. And the last one for me just in terms of 2018 production, can you just talk through the quarterly progression? I think your productions, Q4 or second half weighted, but maybe you can just talk through some of the operational movements we should be conscious of, I guess, in the first and second half?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. It's Tom here. I'll take that one again. You're certainly going to see Carlin weighted to the second half in the fourth quarter. Again, as I mentioned in my comments, driven by stripping and the Mill 6 annual plant maintenance that we do in the second quarter. And then, we start to access the Silverstar ore in the third quarter and well into the fourth quarter. So Carlin is a significant contributor to that second half weighting. You'll certainly see in Merian as we work through our stripping campaign in the first half to three quarters, it reach some high grade ores at Merian. So, we'll see it quite weighted to the second-half. Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, in around Ahafo, as we're in the Subika layback, the open pit at Ahafo, we'll get into some higher grade ores at Subika. And then, we start to – as we move into commercial production in Subika Underground and bring on the refrigeration plant and get more ventilation into the underground mine, we start to bring on some more ore and higher grades out of Subika Underground. So they are some of the features that have us weighted to the second half and into the fourth quarter.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, Tom.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you for the update. I got a couple of questions. Just looking at the Tanami Power, you've got a capital outlay here of $250 million give or take $25 million, and that's for a lease payment, is that CapEx outlay for you a lump sum or is it spread throughout the year? How does that work?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, David. I'll be happy to take that one. So we have indicated $225 million to $275 million for that project and that's been accrued as of 2018 as development capital. And then you'll see annual cash lease payments over a 10-year period starting in 2019, and then we will also reflect about $10 million of owner costs and that will be paid in 2018.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: So with that payment, is that going to be a single lump sum or is it spread throughout the year?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's spread throughout the year.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, I could just presume it's equal quarter-by-quarter then?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, that's fair enough for modeling purposes.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Question then for CC&V, recovery still very low, I'm just wondering what the outlook there is for the mill component of the ore?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Tom here. I'll take that question, David. We've just moved out of the (36:37) pit and we're moving into two other pits at CC&V. So we're going to see lower grades which is I think going to impact on recoveries through the mill over the next period of time. So if I look at CC&V grade, you're going to see similar grades to what you're seeing going forward, and that's been included in our guidance going forward. So it's a factor of moving out of a pit that had higher grades into two other pits that have some lower grades.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: So should we expect something in that 40% to 45% recovery range then for the mill component?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. In terms of modeling purposes, that's – I mean, that is something to consider. The other thing is that as I mentioned in my comments we've just taken the first of our concentrates out of that circuit to send to Nevada and put through the mills there, in particular Mill 6, so CC&V will benefit from some higher recoveries as we bring that on. So we've got a rougher con coming through now, we've got some extra flotation sales to put into make it cleaner con to improve the recoveries over the course of this year. So that will also be part of the equation for CC&V and that's included in our guidance.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Over to Merian, some pretty good looking throughputs nearly 15 million tonnes per annum on an annualized basis, that's going through the softer saprolite material you'd be transitioning over the next year or so into harder material. What sort of throughput should we be thinking about once you move into more of the harder material?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David. Tom again. Yes, we'll start to move through the saprolite this year, we'll see the first of the fresh rock come through that crusher in the second half and the mills' nameplate capacity was down around the 12 million tonnes per annum. So as we start to process the harder ore, it'll come down to those sorts of rates it'll be we've been running up and around 15 tonnes, I think it'll be combination of fresh rock and still some saprolite. So the 12 million to 14 million tonnes per annum is probably something worth modeling.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And that would be in 2019 and 2020 sort of timeframe?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, I think that would be reasonable, David.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just one other thought on the Tanami, with the operating cost savings, were they included in your reserve calculations that were released yesterday as far as thinking about what the implications could be for reserves with the lower cost base?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We haven't carried that into the reserve calculation yet, David. So that would be an upside as we update into our 2018 – end of year 2018 reserves.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's it from me. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning, gentlemen, Nancy.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good morning.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I think in Tom's prepared remarks, he talked about the success of $400 million in full development savings. How is that relative to expectations? And going forward, it's been a great program for extracting value. Does it get harder because it's been so successful or there is enough out there to continue to offset some of the cost creep which I'm sure everybody is worried about in their calculations given the replacement comments?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Michael. Tom again, I'll take that question. I think it was – as Gary mentioned, I think it was terrific work by all of our teams at Newmont to drive hard on the Full Potential program and the $400 million exceeded quite significantly the targets we set ourselves out. Our starting point for Full Potential is to offset escalation, but we certainly encourage all of our teams to drive to get upside about that, and we certainly achieved that in spades in 2017. There is still plenty of upside in our Full Potential program. It's moved from a site-by-site focus and it's still very much the accountability of each site team to deliver on their commitments around Full Potential. But we're seeing real potential upside around the opportunities to work together regionally and globally and really leverage our global footprint as an organization. And we still see plenty of upside continuing in milling and mining to improve our cost and productivity. So, we continue to drive that program hard and I think there's still plenty of upside in the years ahead.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you for that, Tom. And for Nancy, the tax implications, can you put a soft target around some of the positive cash flow metrics or any refunds that you might be anticipating over the next couple of years?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think the high level way to think about this is change in rate relative to our North American operations. Again that's all amongst our diversified portfolio of all the regions in the world. And then the other piece is really just positive cash flow associated with that. So the two pieces will be the monetization of the AMT credits, we'll expect a refund on that over the next five years. And then the second piece will be rate reductions for North American ops. So, that's kind of the way to think about it.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That's fine. And the final thing is, relative to cap spending, how do you – Gary, how do you see the lead, the yellow iron (42:20) that you have certainly you've done a great job of keeping it maintained. Is there a new purchase, is it going to be more of buying it given the opportunities you have in your capital program? Is the average age starting to get to a point we need to, to replenish. Just a sense on that and how those prices and budgets may be going into your capital numbers that you put out today?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Thank you. I think as you look at our sustaining capital guidance we gave out for the next five years, that looked at where we're at in terms of improved equipment lives and we've built that into those plans. So there's no big bump in any sort of equipment replacement that's in the next five-year plan. I think the team's done a great job of looking at not just how we get more life out of equipment components and the equipment, but how we utilize that equipment more effectively going forward. So, I – we also have done, I think, a very good job with our equipment manufacturers, working closely with them on terms that taken longer-term purchase agreements that apply really to all of our operating sites.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And finally, I think, the board should be commended for its confidence in bringing up their dividend policy. Appreciate it. Thanks, Gary, for everything (43:40).
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Just a brief set of comments here. Thank you all for joining our call this morning. We're pleased with our performance in 2017. But as always, our commitment is to take it to the next level which we will do by delivering steady gold production at competitive costs, continuing to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders, and technology and staying at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold. Thank you for joining us and have a safe day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp. Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp. Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp. Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp. Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.
Analysts: John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC. David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc. Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Newmont Q3 2017 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Largent, the floor is yours, ma'am.
Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Before I start, I'd like to take a moment to introduce our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Jessica Largent. Jess joined Newmont in 2015 and most recently served as our senior director of planning, working closely with Investor Relations. Before that, she led the IR function at Turquoise Hill Resources. She brings 12 years of mining industry experience to her new role and we're excited to have her in this key leadership position. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Meredith Bandy. Meredith will be leaving Newmont after three successful years leading our IR function. I know you join me in welcoming Jess and thanking Meredith for her many contributions and wishing them both the best of luck. Turning to results, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont including reaching commercial production at our Tanami Expansion project. Tom, Nancy and I look forward to presenting the team's latest work to execute our strategy, which includes delivering consistently superior operational performance, maintaining a global portfolio of long-life assets and progressing profitable expansions and prospects on four continents and living up to our commitment to lead the gold sector in profitability and sustainability. Turning for more details on slide 4. We delivered exceptional results this quarter keeping us on track to meet full-year cost and production guidance. This performance is the result of ongoing discipline in improving costs and efficiency and investing in growth across the cycle as production from our newest mines, Merian and Long Canyon, offsets lower production at our more mature operations. We were also honored to be recognized as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. Superior operational execution gives us the means to continue investing in the future. We completed the first expansion of the underground mine and mill at Tanami safely, on budget and schedule and expect to generate internal returns of about 35%. We also announced plans to develop Quecher Main in Peru. This project focuses on mining the remaining oxide ore at Yanacocha, which will extend life until 2027 and facilitate future development of our considerable sulfide deposits. Finally, our exploration team is working on four continents to advance the next generation of Newmont mines. Operational excellence also translates to a strong balance sheet and robust returns. We generated nearly $500 million in free cash flow, more than double the prior year quarter. We also generated adjusted EBITDA of more than $650 million and lowered our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times. Finally, we increased our third quarter dividend by 50% to $0.075. This performance is underpinned by our commitment to running safe and sustainable operations. Turning to slide 5. Newmont's mines continued to be among the safest in the world. With the last five years, we've lowered our total injury rates by more than 50%. We've also reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by 22% in that same timeframe, proving that safety and efficiency go hand in hand. Last month, we were honored to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 11th consecutive year and to be ranked as the mining industry leader for the third year running. Newmont was also rated the sector's top performer for water management, biodiversity and corporate citizenship. Index ranking is based on more than 600 data points. The way I look at it, leading sustainability performance translates into three main things, safe working conditions and good jobs for our employees, responsible economic development and environment management for our host communities and strong returns and growth prospects for our shareholders. We're proud of reaching these milestones. But we also understand there's always room for improvement. Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. Our all-in sustaining costs were $943 an ounce for the third quarter, reflecting strong performance at operations in all regions. We continue to focus on managing the things we control, improving ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This helps us offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations. Our all-in sustaining costs also reflect increased investment in exploration and advanced projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Year-to-date, all-in sustaining costs of $909 per ounce is well within our 2017 guidance of between $900 and $950 per ounce. Turning to production on slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter, a 7% improvement over the prior year quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this performance is based on lower cost production at our newest mines. It also demonstrates the benefits of managing a global portfolio. Outperformance in North America and Africa has helped us overcome extreme weather events in Australia and South America. And we remain on track to deliver on our commitments. Year-to-date production of 3.9 million ounces of gold puts us on pace to achieve our full year 2017 guidance of between 5.0 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces. Before we turn to our newest project, I'll take a moment to congratulate the team at Merian who celebrated their first full year of operation earlier this month and are hitting their stride with a new production record set during the quarter. Turning to our newest project on slide 8. Earlier this week, we approved the Quecher Main project in Peru. This project will extend Yanacocha's mine life to 2027, add profitable gold production from remaining oxide ores and serve as a bridge to future growth options, including developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Quecher Main is designed to maintain Yanacocha's gold production at about 200,000 ounces per year at incremental all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce. We've improved our development capital to between $250 million and $300 million to develop a new oxide deposit and heap leach facilities. We expect to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019 and will update our guidance in December. The project will leverage Yanacocha's current infrastructure and defer certain reclamation costs while creating a platform for future growth. Turning to our longer-term growth options on slide 9. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin. And we're working with Goldstrike to explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon where we have an agreement to earn up to 80% equity through exploration investment. Plateau now covers more than 660 square kilometers of stake (08:58) land. And the team completed airborne geophysical surveys and nearly 3,000 meters of diamond drilling this summer. In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha sulfides projects in Peru. And very encouraging results at Chaquicocha from our drilling program there. Our newest prospects are not included in either Quecher Main or Yanacocha sulfides projects. We're also working with Continental Gold to support safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buriticá project in Colombia. Earlier this year, we acquired a 19.9% stake in Continental which will help fund the new mine and give us exposure to both their and other people's exploration properties in Colombia. In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, (09:54), to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. This photo shows the airborne system we launched last week in Ethiopia to begin geologic mapping. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and exploring greenfield prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: (10:20) had a positive quarter with robust cash flow generation and a stronger balance sheet. Slide 11 covers financial highlights. Revenue improved 5% to (10:33) driven by higher sales from our new operations at Long Canyon and Merian. Adjusted net income was $183 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA was $653 million. We improved our quarterly operating cash flow by 35% to $688 million and more than doubled our free cash flow to nearly $500 million ending the quarter with $3 billion of cash. Turning to slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.39 per share, up 22% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 gain related to the sale of equity interests, a $0.01 net gain related to the acquisition of Boddington in 2009 and a $0.02 gain related to certain tax items primarily evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per share. Turning to capital priorities on slide 13. Operational execution, capital discipline and a strong portfolio continue to give us the platform to execute our priorities including investing in profitable growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. We continue to self-fund profitable projects allowing us to grow margins, extend mine life and improve reserve quality. We are also returning more cash to shareholders. This week we announced our third quarter dividend of $0.075 per share which is up 50% from the prior year quarter. In July, we fully repaid $575 million of convertible notes further reducing debt and simplifying our capital structure. Taking this into account and with the free cash flow generated during the quarter, our total liquidity is nearly $6 billion and net debt to EBITDA is at 0.4 times. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tom Palmer to cover operational highlights starting on slide 14.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. Shifting our focus to our regional performance. In North America, our teams are delivering solid results and advancing profitable expansions. In South America, we're recovering from difficult weather earlier this year and expecting a stronger second half. And we're also investing in growth at Yanacocha. In Australia, we continued to set record for mill throughput and recently reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion. And in Africa, we continued to deliver exceptional results primarily due to Full Potential improvements in throughput and recovery and remain on track with our Ahafo expansion projects. Turning to more on North America on slide 15. Our operations are delivering strong results and have produced about 1.7 million ounces of gold year-to-date. This puts us on track to offset the deficit caused by a slide at the Silverstar mine in late 2016. We're now working to de-weight Silverstar as a first step in gaining access to the ore that was covered by the slide. And this production represents upside for 2018 and 2019. At Carlin, we're delivering strong second half results. A successful ground rehabilitation allows us to ramp up production at Leeville. Our Northwest Exodus expansion also continues on course and we recently commissioned power and ventilation systems. Some of you visited our Nevada operations last month and saw the semi-autonomous mining equipment at work in Leeville. We'll also use this technology at Northwest Exodus which is being designed to support autonomous operations. Long Canyon and Cripple Creek & Victor are also performing well and we've accelerated leach pad placements at both operations. Finally, our new Twin Underground mine is underway. Grid development began a month ahead of schedule and we mined first ore in August. This project is expected to improve mill recovery, extend processing life at Twin and reach commercial production in mid-2018. Turning to South America on slide 16. Our operations have turned the corner after the extreme weather impacts of the first half of the year and we're well positioned for a strong fourth quarter. As Gary mentioned, we achieved record production at Merian in August with steady improvement in mine productivity and continued strong performance at the mill. Construction of our new primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of 2018. And we plan to launch our Full Potential program at Merian in the fourth quarter to identify and deliver further value. At Yanacocha, operations have dried out and the team remains on track to meet 2017 production guidance. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transition laws (15:39) at Yanacocha. And we've increased our exploration and advanced project spend in the region. As a result, we're raising our 2017 all-in sustaining cost guidance for the South America region by 7%. As Gary mentioned, we approved the Quecher Main project earlier this week. This project will extend mine life to 2027, giving us time to progress and optimize our approach to developing Yanacocha sulfides. We'll have an update for you on this project in December. Turning to Australia on slide 17. During the quarter, Boddington achieved its fourth month of record mill throughput for the year, helping offset slightly lower grades associated with moving into the south pit layback. At Tanami, the team has done a great job overcoming the impacts of record rainfall earlier this year and is on track to deliver a solid fourth quarter. We also want to congratulate the team for achieving commercial production at the Tanami Expansion safely, on budget and on schedule despite the impact of challenging weather conditions earlier this year. I'm also pleased to report that the mill is already performing above nameplate capacity. At KCGM, we are remediating a slip in the west wall of the Fimiston Pit. We expect to complete this work in 2018 and the team continues its work to offset the impacts in 2017. We also completed mill maintenance in the third quarter that was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter. Lastly, we've completed metallurgical testing and confirmed the recovery model for our Morrison layback at KCGM. And we expect to reach a decision to proceed in the first quarter of 2018. Finally, turning to Africa on slide 18. The region continues to outperform due to mill throughput and recovery improvements delivered through our Full Potential program. This allows us to improve our 2017 cost outlook by about $90 per ounce for Ahafo and about $40 per ounce for the entire Africa region. Ahafo expansion projects are progressing well. Civil works to support the mill expansion are advancing on course and we're mining ore and building surface infrastructure for the Subika Underground mine. We've also received confirmation from the government that the favorable terms of our investment agreement had been extended for another five years at Ahafo, which supports our view that Ghana is a stable operating jurisdiction. Finally, we continued to advance our regional growth studies which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North. With that regional overview, I'll hand it back to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 20. Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund the high-margin projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. We continue to optimize and deliver profitable projects. Turning to slide 21. For the past three years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. We reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion this quarter and will finish Northwest Exodus next year, both expansions add profitable production and service platforms for further exploration. We also announced decisions to fund four expansion projects this year that will improve profitability and extend mine life at Ahafo, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha. Taken together, the nine projects we've approved over the last three years will add annual gold production of up to 1.7 million ounces at all-in sustaining cost of about $750 per ounce for the first five years and generate an average internal rate of return above 20%. Turning to our project pipeline on slide 22. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here, Morrison in Australia, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada and the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana. Midterm projects that will improve our outlook are shown in green, Ahafo North in Ghana and the Tanami power project in Australia. Finally, we continue to invest in advancing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. Tanami power is a new addition to the project pipeline, which I'll describe on slide 23. At Tanami, we're optimizing a project to shift from our current reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to the site, to natural gas that's delivered by pipeline. We'll contract with experts to construct the pipeline and two power plants and expect the project to take about 18 months to build and commission. The Tanami power project is expected to create value by significantly reducing power costs and carbon emissions and by improving supply reliability and scalability. We expect to reach a funding decision later this year. Turning to our longer-term production profile on slide 24. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces for the foreseeable future. And we continue to advance our mid- and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years. In short, Newmont has a stable asset base with considerable upside. We've provided a seven-year production profile in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation. And we believe this outlook differentiates Newmont. Our focus on long-term value creation shows up in our leading reserve profile. Turning to slide 25. Over the last 16 years, we've added more than 123 million ounces to our reserve base by the drill bit at a cost of just $24 per ounce. And half the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by our geologists. Our reserve profile compares favorably to the gold sector average with 129 ounces per 1,000 shares and operating reserve life of almost 12 years and more than 70% of our reserves located in the United States and Australia. We have a proven track record of converting about 80% of our resources into reserves. And this year, we plan to invest more than $200 million in our exploration program to build on that success. We also have more than 50 years worth of drilling results or more than 40 terabytes of information in our exploration database. This along with our proprietary exploration technology represents an unparalleled asset. Putting everything together. Four years ago, we launched a new strategic direction and a new era of productivity, performance and growth at Newmont. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our strategy but with an eye on the longer-term horizon. We'll demonstrate superior operational execution through safe, stable and profitable long-term gold production, continuous cost and productivity improvement and one of the strongest teams in the mining industry. We'll sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets by delivering ongoing margin growth, leading project development and exploration results and a positively differentiated reserve base. Finally, we'll establish ourselves as the frontrunner in terms of profitable and responsibility through ongoing capital discipline across investments and cycles, superior balance sheet strength and dividends and our ability to create and protect value through leading environmental, social and governance performance. Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question we have will come from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I was just wondering, you mentioned the Morrison layback and that presumably is going to add ounces to the reserve base next year. Could you give us a bit of color on what ounces we can expect from that, maybe costs and maybe if there's a difference to the recovery that we've been seeing from the existing ore reserve there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Sure, John. In terms of Morrison, and we haven't yet approved it. It's a sustaining capital project. So, basically, it's about extending mine life. And we've been going through a process. In fact, we delayed approval probably about three or four months, did additional drilling, really focused on metallurgical testing. Tom and I were just out there a couple weeks ago and had a chance to kind of go through where they're at with the project. And the results look to have confirmed what we would have expected from metallurgical recoveries, which is good. And as we get further information together on that, that's one we can provide an update on in our December update when we have Alex Bates, the Regional Vice President, out at Investor Day to provide an update.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So the recoveries are going to be lower than we've seen previously?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No, no, no. It confirmed we'd see good recoveries there. That's what we wanted to confirm and we see that coming through fine.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, fine. And then we've seen the first reserve reporting last night. How are you feeling about the reserve exercise that you're busy going through at the moment? Just wondered where you think you could be adding reserves this year.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Well, it's still early days as we look around where we've been focusing. We had a target, I think, we put out to the market in terms of about 3 million ounces by the drill bit. And we continue to see how that delivers both at Tanami where we see potential, Subika and potentially also down at Yanacocha.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yanacocha.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I've got Grigore here in the background whispering at me. Merian as well.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So Yanacocha would be the Quecher Main material coming in, would it?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. It could be more resource there with the Chaquicocha at this stage.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Oh, of course. You were having some success with another layback there, right?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Correct. In terms of looking at it, though that's not included in Quecher Main at this stage.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And you were reiterating that the sulfides were coming on well. Any new developments there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Nothing new. Tom and the team – actually, Dean Gehring will be providing an update at the Investor Day in December.
John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, cool. Looking forward to it. Thanks a lot. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, John. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next we have Michael Dudas of Vertical Research.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Jessica. First question is – Gary, we're going to get a lot more information on the long-term outlook in December. But how do you see going into the budgeting for 2018 and beyond, any cost inflation, vendors starting to raise prices, offsets to what Full Potential could provide from an operating basis to maintain the strong cost performance you guys have had through the downturn?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Now, Michael, as you say, Full Potential continues to be a core to the business in looking at both efficiency and cost improvements. And I think with the focus and what the team has been working on here as we pull together our 2018 business plan, we'll be able to demonstrate that with the guidance in December as we present it. In terms of inflationary pressures, the key things we keep an eye on; obviously, the Aussie dollar is one element that we don't control directly and we see that flow through. As gold prices come up, that's come up a little bit. But that's pretty much kept in line there with the price. Oil price, it's been bouncing around. We've been using $55. We continue in our outlook going forward to be pretty much in that same ballpark. I think the only place – as we keep an eye is labor inflation and watching turnover as the leading indicator on that both in Australia and parts of North America. It's not any sort of a big jump up, but it's one we're keeping an eye on. Remember, overall, our focus. We build in in our planning process 3% a year inflation into the plans as the teams are developing their plans out for the first five years. So 3% each year. And the objective of the Full Potential effort is to at least offset or more than offset that 3% inflation. So in terms of other areas, mining equipment and supplies, we've extended our agreements, so not seeing anything in a major way there inflationary-wise. And likewise on the commodity inputs.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: In the trip out to the mines in Nevada last month, I enjoyed working the joystick on the semi-autonomous equipment. As you look forward and you're developing expansion to the mine plans or new mine plans, how much greater those types of equipment and concepts are going to be to put forth in the new generation of mines or to help for Newmont as you move forward?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, I'll take a brief shot. And then I'll have Tom Palmer give an update because he's got an extensive background in designing autonomous mines and give a little bit more background. But I think in terms of designing mines, it's clearly all part of the technology that we look at. We look at the value it delivers. You look at what we're developing at Northwest Exodus where we've allowed for. And we'll have autonomous equipment in use there. We have it already in use at Leeville right next door. So that's easy technology to transfer and at Subika. It's not limited by location. We're looking at Subika in Ghana as another place to use the autonomous equipment. And a good example there; you can put operation of that equipment, as you saw, up on the surface. And you don't have to go through the travel time back and forth to the face (31:24). You don't have to have the same clearing procedures after a blast. So it leads to higher productivity. And these are things we'll look at really at all of our operations. On the surface side, I'll hand it over to Tom to give a little bit of background.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, thanks, Gary. I think my experience with this technology and automation is, first and foremost, it's fundamentally safer. You're taking human beings out of the process and the system runs without some of that risk. And to build on Gary's comment, the other thing it does, it can take people out of an environment, say, an underground environment where they're not exposed to the same level of things like diesel particulates. So there's a health improvement there as well as safety, first and foremost. In terms of the design of our mines, our underground mines going forward, as we talked about with Northwest Exodus, are designed to accommodate autonomous equipments. So we've got the option to bring that in. The surface mines, it's really something you look at as you go forward. My experience with this type of equipment in the iron ore industry is there was a capital offset when you're building a new mine to bring that equipment in. And the cost of running that equipment is still something that needs to catch up. So retrofitting or introducing autonomous equipment into existing mines is still something that we're looking at and considering. But there's still some work that the industry has to do to have a cost improvement that'll allow you to do that retrofit. So we're keeping an eye on those developments.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Well, I trust Caterpillar is working hard on that from their end as well. I appreciate your thoughts, gentlemen. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Next we have David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary, Nancy and Tom. Thank you for the update. Now just going over to Quecher Main. Can you just give us a bit of an outline about the throughput you expect, the grade and whether the material would be processed via the heap leach or the mill and what most of the CapEx would be dedicated to? Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: David, we just happen to have RSVP here. And I'm going to introduce Dean Gehring who took over now about four months ago as the Regional Vice President and I'll have him handle that question. Dean.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Gary. David, it's a good question. Quecher Main is just largely an extension of what we've been doing at Yanacocha for a number of years. Most of the capital is dedicated toward just building a new leach pad facility. We'll largely use existing equipment. The grades are similar to what we've been mining before in that area. And it's reflected in our guidance and some of the things that Gary said earlier about what we expect to see in terms of production. So it's all going to be oxide leach production. There isn't anything that's going to our gold mill.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay, so all oxide leach. And what do you think the stacking rate might be there?
Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.: Well, we put in about 16-meter lifts. We'll be doing two a year. So you'll see about 32 meters of stacking per year.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: What does that translate into tons, please?
Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.: I have to look that up because if I gave it to you in tons, then it wouldn't necessarily tell you what it was in meters. So different people ask the question differently.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Because I'll tell you how I model it. I model it on tons, grade, recovery and that gets me ounces. I don't know what meter lifts mean.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: But I think at the end of the day, David, you can count – it's going to add about 200,000 ounces a year on a 100% basis once it starts production later in 2019.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Now maybe one for Nancy. Debt retirement in the quarter, you still got $3 billion of cash. Have you any thoughts of additional debt repayment going forward?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, David. As we look at our maturities, we've got one set coming due in 2019 and a bit coming due in 2022. We continuously do liability management work around those tranches. And at this point in time, with where those are trading, it does not make sense for us to do early retirement. But we'll continue to evaluate that. Our current plan would be to pay those tranches off with cash on hand at the time that they mature.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for that.
Operator: The next question we have will come from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Good morning, everybody.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good morning, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Gary, questions for you, if I could. Thank you very much for the Tanami power project that you're talking about. Just wanted to get a little bit more information there. I know you're mentioning going from diesel to natural gas. Can you just remind me what your power costs are currently now, where you think they'll go and what percentage of your cost structure is power?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. I'm having folks help draw that up here because I don't have that at the tip of my tongue. So let's find that and I'll come back here in a moment.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: All those mines and you don't have them there? It's getting -
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We have them there. I just don't have it in my memory banks at the top.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay. Well, then maybe, Gary, another question for you. Just coming back to Twin Creeks. I know we talked about negotiations with Barrick and I know I ask you every quarter. But December is coming. It's not too far away. How are the negotiations going on trying to resolve an amicable contract between the two to get the mineralization through your Twin Creek autoclave?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No. We continue to talk with our partner there about what the potential would be for the extension of this agreement. We're also working through as they're assessing different expansion plans and how to take the next step of expansion effectively and efficiently at Turquoise Ridge. So that work continues.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: And I think they mentioned on their call that you're going to make a decision on that in January of next year. Is that correct?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I believe that's what they're targeting is a January capital decision on that expansion.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay. And just coming back if we have those and maybe just also the capital. What are we talking about in terms of the Tanami power from 35,000 feet, just sort of the range?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I'm going to hand over to Tom. I believe he's got both the cost number in terms of power costs and he can – we'll give more detail on the capital as we get a little bit closer to approval, which will be by the end of this year. But over on the power.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay. Thank you.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, Tanya. The roughly $0.25 kilowatt hour power cost today, diesel-fired power stations at Tanami. And with gas coming in, gas-fired power stations, you can expect to see in the order of 20% improvement there. So other key factors are that the reliability – we won't to see those same issues that we experienced earlier this year with diesel supply and quite a significant improvement in carbon emissions as a result of the cleaner fuel source. So I'm very pleased about that. In terms of -
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: And what percentage of – yeah, and what percentage of your cost is -
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: It makes up about 25% of our costs...
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: ...power generation.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay. So that would be the impact from that.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: And you could get that in, I think Gary said, in about 18 months once the decision is made.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Once we got the approval to proceed, we dropped the – there's a north-south power line that runs up through Alice Springs in Australia. So you connect to that and then run across to the mine site. So that's the order of a 400, 450 kilometer pipeline. And we'll run that right through to the underground mine at DBS and then connect to power stations. If you recall, the processing plant and the underground mine are around 45 kilometers apart. So (39:45) connecting power lines and join those two up. So it's around that time to – critical path is to sink that power line. So you can imagine the conditions up there through the dry and wet season. You've got to sequence around that. So that's sort of timeframe to get it into place.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: So you're talking at least towards the end of 2019, early 2020?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Possibly a bit earlier, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: All going well, the weather looks after us; I'd see that we'd be up and running a bit earlier than that.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank: Okay, so in the 2019 frame. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. I look forward to getting that capital number.
Operator: The next question we have will come from Lucas Pipes of FBR Capital Markets.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good morning.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Gary, I had a bigger picture question for you. And yesterday, I was on a Freeport call that lasted very long about the issues they're dealing with. Obviously, you have exited Indonesia, but it's not just Indonesia. I think when you look across the industry, kind of resource nationalism is a problem. And how do you think about that? Am I wrong in that assessment? And then more importantly, as you think about your portfolio longer term, is it changing the way you want to allocate capital? Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No. Thanks for the question, Lucas. I look at it a couple of different ways. One, I think in terms of how the industry presents itself to the world from a cost standpoint. The effort to go to all-in sustaining costs was a step in the right direction to try to get a better view out to the world in terms of what the actual cost of production is. And for the most part, we've stayed very true to what that means. That hasn't necessary been the case everywhere. But I know the World Gold Council is taking another look at that approach and making sure that we get a true measure and metric of what the cost of production is out there. And not everything's represented even in all-in sustaining costs. So I think making sure we get the right view on cost out's important because the first thing people look at is what gold price is and what the cost numbers are and say they want a bigger piece of the pie. I think in terms of where we operate, I think we've got very stable regions that we operate in. That doesn't mean we're immune. I know we had the recent efforts in Western Australia to look to raise the royalty rate. And I think that's been a big process and congratulations to the team. At this stage, Alex Bates and the team, they're working with the other gold producers in Western Australia to help educate the politicians in Western Australia and the rest of the marketplace in terms of what the effect of raising royalty rates has. And this is consistent whether it's in Western Australia or anywhere else in the world. If you raise the cost of production through having higher royalty rates, it raises cutoff grades and reduces mine lives. So it's not good for long-term investments. You have to have fair share in your revenues. And I think just being more transparent about what is being shared and improving on that, that's something I know we're working with ICMM. We look at our own reporting of taxes. We have our social responsibility report. We provide that information. But I think that's a key area. On top of that, we've got agreements with governments. You just heard the extension of the agreement in Ghana for five years as a good example of having an agreement where they've been very consistent and lived up to that, a little different than our experience was in Indonesia. And we've got agreements in Peru and agreements in Suriname as well. So I think it's working with the government officials and making sure they understand what our economic situation looks like and what the impact can be in the long term on mine life, community and jobs at the end of the day.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. Well, very much appreciate your answer and good luck with everything. I look forward to your Investor Day in December.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Lucas.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: And thank you, everyone, for joining our call this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter, keeping us on track to meet production cost and capital guidance for 2017. We also continue to invest in the future with our Tanami Expansion reaching commercial production on time and budget and our Quecher Main project set to extend life at Yanacocha. Finally, we generated even stronger cash flows, giving us the means to maintain robust returns and distinguish ourselves as an industry leader in sustainability. I'll end by inviting you to join us at our Investor Day on December 6, where we'll introduce you to the rest of our regional business leaders, share our refreshed five-year outlook and bring you up to speed in how we're leveraging technology to raise our performance to the next level. Thank you for joining us and have a safe day.
Operator: And we thank you, sir, and to the rest of the management team also for your time today. Again, the conference call has now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you again. Everyone, take care and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Second Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Etienne Morin, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Morin.
Etienne Morin: Thank you, operator, and welcome to the Goldcorp second quarter 2017 conference call. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during today’s presentation, we will be making comments containing forward-looking information. I invite you to read this slide, which describes some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect Goldcorp’s performance in the future. And as such, actual results may differ materially from the views expressed today. For further information on the risks and uncertainties, please consult our annual information form. For the formal portion of the call today, we have David Garofalo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Harbidge, Senior Vice President, Exploration. Also joining us are Russell Ball, our Chief Financial Officer; Todd White, Chief Operating Officer; Charlene Ripley, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel; and Jason Attew, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy and incoming CFO. For those of you participating on the webcast, we’ve included a number of slides to support today’s discussion. With that, I’ll turn the call over to David Garofalo. Dave?
David Garofalo: Good morning and good afternoon. Since the reorganization of the company in the second quarter of 2016, we have delivered four consecutive quarters of steady, on target and increasingly profitable gold production. During the second quarter, we produced 635,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $800 per ounce, compared to 613,000 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $1,067 per ounce for the second quarter of 2016. This puts us slightly ahead of pace at midyear to achieve our full year guidance of 2.5 million ounces, plus or minus 5%. We improved our 2017 all-in sustaining cost guidance to $825 per ounce, plus or minus 5%, from $850 per ounce, reflecting the progress we’ve made toward realizing $250 million in sustainable annual efficiencies by the middle of 2018. To date, our efficiency program is firmly on track with $200 million expected to be achieved in 2017 across our portfolio. Quarterly gold production is expected to be – is expected to continue to be in a fairly flat range of 625,000 to 650,000 ounces per quarter as a planned decrease in grades at Peñasquito in the second half of the year will be largely offset by the continued ramp-up in production at Cerro Negro and Éléonore, and an improved grade profile in Red Lake. During the quarter, we also continued the optimization of our portfolio by unlocking value through the sale of non-core assets and recycling the capital back into the business by reinvesting in our pipeline of development projects. These projects will be fundamental in achieving our 20/20/20 targets and delivering net asset value growth beyond the next five years. So far, this year, we have formed a 50-50 joint venture with Barrick in the 60 million ounce Maricunga district in Chile, divested $500 million of non-core assets in Mexico and Guatemala, and delivered solid execution on our key growth projects. Turning to the second quarter financial results, net earnings were $135 million or $0.16 per share compared to a net loss of $78 million or $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flows were $320 million for the quarter compared to $204 million for the same period last year. During the first half of 2017, we continue to execute on our productivity and cost optimization program, with all operations participating in the delivery phase. Building on the $115 million of savings we delivered in 2016 from Cerro Negro and the corporate office, we are seeing solid progress in many of our sites as productivity goals are achieved and rationalization of sustaining capital is implemented across all of our sites. On that basis, we have reduced our full year sustaining capital by $100 million to $600 million. We expect to achieve our current target of $250 million by the middle of 2018, and given our substantial progress to date, the program is likely to be extended beyond 2018 with the efficiency target increase. This program is a driving force behind achieving our 20% reduction in all-in sustaining cost by 2021, and has directly contributed to our substantially improved bottom line. As we discussed last quarter, our program doesn’t just include cost reduction initiatives, a large part of achieving those sustainable efficiencies relates to volume or productivity increases. So far, a majority of the $200 million expected to be achieved in 2017 has come from cost reductions, but as we work through our systematic progress of diagnosis – systematic process, excuse me, of diagnosis, prioritization, design and delivering on these productivity improvement initiatives, we expect to continue to see tangible results. Our robust project pipeline continue to advance during the quarter. At Peñasquito, the Pyrite Leach Project achieved construction progress of 14%, and engineering progress of 94%. Major procurement activities are nearing completion and material and equipment is arriving on-site. Earthwork activities are now complete, concrete works are underway and mechanical installation has commenced and is ramping up. The Carbon Pre-flotation Project, or CPP, is also being constructed, which will allow Peñasquito to process ore which was previously considered uneconomic, including significant amounts already in stockpiles. CPP earthworks is substantially complete and the concrete works are underway. The project remains on budget and on schedule. At Musselwhite, the Materials Handling Project achieved 31% completion and approximately 94% of the detailed engineering. Key underground development advanced on plan and all major components have been procured. The project remains on budget and on schedule. At Borden, ramp development commenced with 122 meters completed during the second quarter. We expect final pre-feasibility study work to be completed in the first half – first quarter of 2019, after completion of the bulk sample. With expected the ramp completion and minimal additional infrastructure required for full-scale mining, we expect to reach commercial production six months following the bulk sample extraction. The deposit remains open at depth and laterally. Also within the Timmins district at the Century Project, work continue to progress on the pre- feasibility study, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. The base case pre-feasibility is expected to support conversion of a portion of the measured and indicated resources and to an initial reserve estimate in this year’s reserve statements. Further optimization will follow the completion of the base case pre-feasibility study to improve the economics as well as looking at options to integrate additional mill feed such as the Pamour and Pamour West Open Pits. At the Coffee Project in Yukon, following the submission of the environmental social economic assessment in the first quarter, we have reached an agreement in principle on financial terms with the Tr’ondek Hwech’in First Nation. This is an important milestone in the development of the Coffee Project as we continue working and consulting with our local partners. On the technical side, review and optimization of the feasibility study and planning for upgrades to site infrastructure continued during the quarter. We still expect first gold production in 2021. Paul will discuss current exploration activities at Coffee shortly. At Cochenour, we’re undertaking the necessary work to convert a portion of the 299,000 ounces of indicated resources into reserves and we expect that estimate, along with an initial production profile, to be disclosed with our third quarter results in October. As a reminder, within our projected 20% increase in gold production over the next five years, we have not included any ounces from Cochenour or HG Young. At our new project in the Maricunga district, Cerro Casale and Caspiche, the project team will undertake a concept study on the combined projects over the next 24 months to annualize the synergies and the consolidation of infrastructure to reduce capital and operating costs, reducing the project footprint and provide increased returns compared to standalone projects. One of our priorities this year is to optimize the portfolio by unlocking value through the sale of non-core assets and recycling the capital back into the business by reinvesting in our pipeline of development projects. Since our acquisition of Kaminak in July of last year, we’ve been successful at optimizing our portfolio through the sale of higher cost assets such as Los Filos and smaller non-core projects such as Cerro Blanco, Camino Rojo and San Nicolas. We’ve used a portion of those proceeds to enter a new district in the Maricunga belt, and during that period, we’ve added a net 10.6 million ounces of gold reserves from Cerro Casale and Coffee at a very low cost of entry of $23 per ounce of gold or $14 per ounce on a gold equivalent basis with the potential to grow all these reserves further. Over the last 18 months, we’ve been able to grow reserve per share by 21% as a result of these transactions with a further 20% growth target in reserves per share over the next five years from our existing portfolio. With that I’ll turn it over to Paul for a review of our exploration activities.
Paul Harbidge: Thanks, Dave. As you just pointed out with the disposal of non-core assets and the formation of the Maricunga joint venture with Barrick during the first half of 2017, we have seen a net increase in our gold reserves from 42 million ounces to 50 million ounces. With an enviable portfolio of brownfield exploration opportunities within our key mining districts, we are maintaining our five year 20% gold reserve growth plan. Based on the positive results obtained so far at Cerro Negro, we’ve increased the exploration budget from $20 million to $26 million for the remainder of the year as we accelerate our drilling to provide the pipeline of veins for future resource conversion. At the Coffee camp, drill results so far have shown continuity of mineralization at both the Arabica and Suprimo T8, T9 targets while initial results are positive at Decaf. Drill rigs are now testing further afield withinthis highly perspective camp. Lastly following the completion of the Cerro Casale acquisition, we have begun building a strong geological team to support the concept study work that the joint venture will undertake over the next 24 months. One of our key priorities is to grow reserves by 20%, including loss through depletion by 2021 to 60 million ounces. Our focus to achieve this growth will come primarily from the conversion of resources at our Century Project as we continue to advance the prefeasibility study. From Cerro Negro, as we execute our drill programs and our perspective portfolio of veins and from converting the measured indicated gold resources at the newly acquired Caspiche Project. As we continue to execute on our exploration programs across the broad portfolio through the management of the resource triangle, we expect to see new discoveries and more conversion of ounces from resources to reserves over time. During the second quarter, we continue to build a strong foundation of targets to provide future organic growth opportunities. Since August of 2016, we have identified many new targets, but have also rejected others. We have added a total of 30 new targets at the base of the triangle most notably in Mexico around Peñasquito. Geological modeling work to support the mid-year reserve and resource update has now been completed and handed over to reserve declaration. Our exploration teams have now transitioned back to resource growth opportunities with geologists reviewing and reprioritizing targets. For many sites, it has been several years since significant field exploration has been done outside of the mine environment. I will now provide an update on a number of our exploration programs across the group. For further details please refer to the exploration press release we issued yesterday, which contains all of the details and results. At Cerro Negro resource conversion and expansion drill programs continued at Marianas Norte Este B, San Marcos and Bajo Negro veins systems. Exploration drilling continued at Silica Cap and logistical work for an airborne geophysical and surface geochemical sampling program were completed. A total of 59 holes for just over 23,000 meters were drilled during the quarter. At Silica Cap target, further positive gold assay results from drilling were returned and define at least eight tons of meter long zone of mineralization, which is open in all directions. However, drilling has been hampered by poor ground conditions and a number of holes abandoned due to clay and broken rock associated with the alteration halo adjacent to the veins. Additionally, it became apparent that the principal vein at Silica Cap dips in the opposite direction to Bajo Negro, and therefore, a number of initial holes missed the target. On the positive side, as well as the principal vein, we’re also intersecting a number of narrow but high-grade hanging wall veins, including 4 meters of 15.7 grams per and 4.8 meters at 11.46 grams per ton. The veins on Silica Cap, Bajo Negro area, which covers some 14 square kilometers, is turning into a significantly mineralized area, and as well as continuing to drill test Silica Cap, a fence of heel to toe holes will also be drilled across the entire target area. Drilling will also be undertaken on the following vein systems in the second half of the year: Eureka Southeast, San Marcos West; San Marcos Sur; and Mariana Sur. At Peñasquito, exploration focused on grand validation of the 13 targets identified in the generative study completed in Q1, as well as regional rock chip and selective leach source sampling programs to identify additional near-mine targets. The results of the soil and rock chip work and further modeling of geophysical data has led to the identification of nine new targets. The majority of these targets lie within a broad north, northeast striking corridor, which also includes no mineralization of Peñasquito, Noche Buena and La Buena, suggesting the presence of a major albeit still poorly explored mineralized trend, as shown on the picture on the right-hand side of the slide. Also during the quarter, an agreement with San Marco Resources to acquire the La Pinta six concession for $225,000 was finalized. This acquisition adds an additional 80 square kilometers of exploration tenure contiguous to Noche Buena and provides additional early stage targets for evaluation. At Coffee, the exploration team continue to execute the drill program, evaluating a portfolio of near-surface oxide gold targets, ranging from those within the planned mine footprint to more distilled grassroots targets. In addition, infill drilling was completed to upgrade the mineral resource classification at the Latte deposit. Gold assay results from our drill programs this season have so far shown continuity of oxide mineralization at both the Arabica and Supremo T8, T9 targets, while initial results are positive at Decaf, and new targets are being tested within this highly prospective camp. As we move into the second half of the year, as well as continuing to test the oxide mineralization, we’ll also be embarking on our first drill programs to evaluate the sulphide component of the hydrothermal system. Moving to the Red Lake district, at Cochenour, exploration work continue to focus on increasing the geological understanding of the upper main zone in the starter mine area. An updated grade contour of the upper main zone is shown here to highlight some of the high-grade veining structures and continuity of mineralization, following the completion of an updated geological model. We are on track to release our first reserve estimate for the starter mine in the upper part of the deposit in quarter three. While over at HG Young, the latest work has been on defining the structural controls, which has mineralization, and the results revealed, firstly, the main HG Young Shear, which trends 150 degrees, and has fault-filled quartz-sheelite-gold veins. There’s a second structural control of mine trend parallel structures, which they’re orientated 125 degrees and are characterized by arsenopyrite mineralization as well as sheeted quartz veins. And a third geological trend, which is in the orientation of 250 degrees, however, previous drilling is orientated subparallel to this trend and its significance is uncertain at this point. The high-grade plunge at HG Young is caused by the intersection of the HG Young Shear and the Mine Trend Faults. New resource estimate is being calculated, which will form the basis to a development strategy for the deposit, and whether we do this from a surface decline or underground drift from an existing infrastructure. Drilling will continue to develop this project, with holes targeting the above structural controls, including high-grade plunge. Moving to Timmins, the exploration program in the Porcupine district is focused on evaluating several project areas, including the Century Project, Hoyle Pond and known advanced projects as well as the Borden project in Chapleau. At Century, five rigs have drilled a total of 18,744 meters during the quarter. The surface geotechnical program is now complete and the focus is on infill drilling the resource model from both surface and underground. Gold assay results returned to date are in line with expectations and are confirming the geological model. The model, including resource estimation, will be updated once all of the drilling has been completed and assay results received. We will provide an update as part of our reserve and resources update in October. The Ethier target remains the next regional target in line for testing, and planning is underway to mobilize the drill rig to the target site. 4,700-meter drilling program has been designed to test the potential for high grade, quartz vein hosted mineralization approximately four kilometers east of Hoyle Pond. In Borden, we continue to refine the geological model through a core relog, while prospecting teams are out in the [indiscernible] sampling and mapping to define the next level of targets for testing. Turning to Musselwhite, the team continued evaluating near-mine targets that can be tested from current infrastructure or surface platforms. In addition, surface field programs were initiated after a hiatus of several years in order to define – to identify new targets in a very underexplored Greenstone Belt. During quarter two, underground exploration was focused on completing the resource, conversion drilling in the West Limb and C Block areas, as well as testing several new and follow-up targets. A 9th, West Limb mineralized area was also identified as a result of the geological model refinement, and this is referred to as the Rifle zone, where over 200 meters of continuous mineralization has been defined today. We also started a deep hole from the surface on the north shore of the lake, which is almost a 1.5-kilometer step out from known mineralization at the mine and is testing to a vertical depth with 1,700 meters. At quarter end, the hole have reached the depth of 1,200 meters, with geology and structure being intercepted as planned. A series of drill-to-holes will be wedged from this hole to evaluate extensions to the various mineralized loads and we’ll be able to update you as time goes on. Exploration at Éléonore continued on underground minex targets, in addition to the completion of a new property scale geology interpretation and the identification of nine follow-up areas. The new geological interpretation incorporates reprocessed geophysical data, outcrop mapping and geochemical data, provides context to known anomalies and gold shearings. Teams are now in the field validating the map as well as mapping and sampling target areas with the objective of preparing drill motivations for the winter season. At the Synee target, the results from the initial scout drilling program in quarter one did not confirm a strongly mineralized bedrock to support the values we turned in surface boulders. Work is currently focused on detailed mapping, additional boulder sampling and a detailed till survey sample – survey over the target area to determine whether further drilling is required. At Old Camp, gold assay results confirm mineralization to be associated with narrow shear zones, hosted by diorite intrusion. Exploration work is now focused 1.3 kilometers to the northeast, where there is a known multielement lake bottom sediment anomaly to prioritize for additional drilling. Overall, I’m very pleased with the progress being made and the results being returned from this diversified and underexplored portfolio. I’ll now pass back to Dave for some further comments.
David Garofalo: Just wanted to highlight a couple of organizational changes before we open up the lines to Q&A. We further strengthened our board in the quarter with the appointment of Matthew Coon Come. Matthew is a former Grand Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees and also the former National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada. He brings, obviously, valuable perspective on partnerships with indigenous communities near our mines. He also brings a very keen business mind to the board, given his success as a business entrepreneur over many decades. I’d also like to acknowledge and thank Russell Ball. Russell stepped in as CFO when I joined in early 2016, with two objectives. One was to restructure the finance in corporate development organizations and to add vital bank strength to our finance team to ensure an orderly succession to a permanent CFO. He’s done a tremendous job in that regard for Goldcorp, and I’m grateful to him for his partnership and his willingness to stay through the coming months to ensure a smooth transition to Jason Attew. Jason joined us a year ago and has done a great job of de-lighting significant value from our non-core assets and helping to build what we believe is the strongest gold pipeline among senior gold producers. With that, operator, we’d be pleased to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now take questions from the telephone lines. And your first question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: Yes, thank you. Dave, just wondering if you’re happy with the progress at Éléonore this quarter? It seems to take a step back in terms of mining rate and milling rate in the quarter versus Q1? And secondly, I understand there’s a study underway at the mine to figure out what the sustainable mining rate might be. I’m wondering if you’ve got any findings out of that yet?
David Garofalo: Yes. Todd will take that question. Thanks, Greg.
Todd White: Yes, thanks for the question. So yes, I would say, we’ve discussed previously, really, the catalyst for the uptick in mine tonnes at Éléonore is bringing on the development of the Horizon 5, which we expect in mid-2018. Given that, we do expect 5,000 to 5,300 tonnes per day to be in that range for Éléonore for the remainder of the year in terms of the mine. We do expect an uptick in grade towards the second half of the year. And I guess, relative to the 7,000 tonnes a day, we previously discussed that, where we’ve looked at it and we’ve confirmed that we do believe 7,000 tonne is achievable, given five mining horizons. So that is still our base plan and we’re comfortable with that.
Greg Barnes: Okay, great. And just a second question, Dave. I know there’s been a lot of talk in the press about the permitting at Coffee. Can you talk about what’s going on there and the progress you’re making?
David Garofalo: Well, for us, critical path to permitting is getting First Nations engagement, getting an impact benefit agreements done. In fact, since we filed our initial application in March 31, we made significant progress with Tr’ondek Hwech’in First Nation. We came to financial terms with them in principle. And now, we’re working to the ancillary parts of the IBA, so we’re quite confident that we’ll be able to maintain timelines on the project. We’re still looking about four years to first production in 2021.
Greg Barnes: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton: Good morning, Dave and team. Thank you for the update. Just looking at Peñasquito, a bit of a reduction there on the throughput in the quarter. Just wondering what we should be expecting in the next quarter or the next half? And also, just to double check that you’re sticking with your 0.55 gram kind of guidance for the year, given where we’ve been in the first half?
Todd White: Yes, this is Todd. So look, we’re sticking with the 105,000 to 110,000 tonne average throughput for the remainder of the year. What I would tell you in the second quarter is, as you recall, we’re mining out of the bottom of the pit right now in Phase 5. We had a bit of a slower dewatering response that slowed us down there. That’s been corrected. We’ve installed some additional wells and that drawdown is now allowing full mine capacity there. So we’re comfortable that we’re back to the 105,000 tonne range for the remainder of the year. Relative to the grade, as you mentioned, we previously said 0.53 as an average. We now see that pushing out to about 0.6 for the remainder of the year, and that’s really a result of some of these tonnes that didn’t come through in Q2 that start to come through in Q3. So on the average, it pops to grade up a little bit higher than prior guidance.
David Haughton: So Todd, just for clarity, is that 0.6 for Q3 and Q4? Or 0.6 for the year?
Todd White: That would be the average for the year. So you can think what we’ve done for the first half and do the math to get to 0.6.
David Haughton: Okay. Having a look at Red Lake, throughput there has gone down quite a bit with the rationalization that you had of the milling. What should we be thinking about as a sustainable throughput rate? Is what we’re seeing in the second quarter indicative of where we should be going?
Todd White: Yes. Relative to Red Lake, as you’re right, we did shut down one of the mills. The throughput rate where we were in 1,650, 1,700 range or so is where we were in the quarter. Going forward, we do expect to see that come up as we expect our – the development that we’ve been putting in place at Red Lake roughly over 40 meters a day is unlocking a lot of stopes later in the year. So we do see that mill rate start to come up and match the mine rate, which will be higher than it was in the second half. So we do expect an increasing rate in the second half.
David Haughton: And just the last one, again, on expectations of throughput. Cerro Negro, you’re still happy getting it up to about 4,000 tonnes a day in the second half of next year.
Todd White: Yes, I think, Cerro Negro is actually very pleased with the progress thereon. We’re on track with the development of Marianas Norte, which is, again similar to Éléonore, it’s that third mining front that is really going to get that tonnage up to 4,000. We’re on track with that, and we’re comfortable that, next year, we’ll be seeing that.
David Haughton: Right, thank you, Todd. Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: Hi, good afternoon, guys. So my first question I guess is a follow-up with Peñasquito. So you’re indicating now 0.6 gram per tonne on average? Should we expect that change in grade to come out of 2018 period?
Todd White: As you will recall, 2018 is we’re predominantly stockpiling – processing stockpile material. So this is not pulling grade forward, it’s simply mining the grade out of the remainder of the bottom of Phase 5, which again, is pushed into Q3 a little bit. So there’s no pull forward of grade here.
Anita Soni: All right. And then, my second question is with regards to the unit cost. Is there, I noticed this quarter that it wasn’t in the MD&A, and it was in the prior quarter. Is it somewhere else? Or is this a change in policy going forward? And could you talk about that?
David Garofalo: Yes, I mean, unit cost are expected to be in line with expectations. We provide our unit cost in most staying cost basis and byproduct basis per ounce of gold production. I think, you’ll find that’s pretty consistent with our peer companies in this space in terms of the disclosure.
Anita Soni: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mike Parkin from National Bank. Please go ahead.
Mike Parkin: Hi, guys, most of the questions I had have been answered. Just wondering about a little bit of clarity about Alumbrera, hearing a bit of chatter in the market about it. Do you guys have an idea of how that asset will be for the second half?
David Garofalo: Right now, it’s unclear. There was a court order issued to shut down operations. There’s an orderly shutdown occurring as we speak. I know there’s an appeal by Glencore, the operator, and by the government as well on that court order. It’s really hard to tell when it will be up and running. Just to put it in perspective, it contributes about 10,000 to 20,000 ounces per quarter for us, so not a significant impact on our production forecast for the year.
Mike Parkin: Okay. Thanks. That’s it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Steven Butler from GMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Steven Butler: Good afternoon, guys. Todd, could you just elaborate again, remind us again of the Carbon Pre-floatation Project, CPP project at Peñasquito, its main metrics and timing implementation? Thanks.
Todd White: So you’ll recall that what we previously discussed, what it really is, is a component of the pyrite leach, which – Pyrite Leach Project, which is really allowing us to treat higher organic carbon content ores. And really, what it is, it’s designed to pre-float the carbon component of the ore out, prior to sending that material further on to Pyrite Leach, which we want the carbon out, which to eliminate any sort of preg-robbing issues. So the carbon pre-float does come in a bit earlier than the overall Pyrite Leach Project. So we’re looking at that later in 2018, when that comes in. That then allows us to commission that ahead of Pyrite Leach. So really, what it is, is the ability to deal with the preg-robbing issues before we send it to conjugate these.
Steven Butler: Okay. So when you guys presented your Pyrite Leach economics, it was sort of integrated with the CPP? Is that the idea?
Todd White: Correct.
Steven Butler: Okay. Yes, thank you, Todd.
Todd White: CPP was integrated into that.
Steven Butler: Yes, okay, got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from John Bridges from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Good morning, Dave, everybody. Just wondered, the weather, I believe, in the Southern Hemisphere has been pretty bad this winter. And just wondering if that was interfering with Cerro Negro’s Q3?
Todd White: This is Todd. You’re right, we did see some pretty extreme weather down in Southern Argentina. We did have a bit of impact on Q2, the National Power Grid was affected, which did affect us. We saw about six days of interruption but nothing significant. Right now that weather has changed in Q3 so far, there’s been no issues whatsoever. So bit of a short-term hit there.
John Bridges: Okay, great. And then maybe if I may, it’s a bit premature I know, but if you could give us some sort of indication as to what sort of shape project you’d be scoping out at Casale Caspiche? I’m guessing that you’d be looking to do a Phase 1 project at Caspiche? Is that what – how we should think about it?
Russ Ball: John, it’s Russ Ball. If you think about the journey we went through on NuevaUnion with Teck and our El Morro in their Relincho project, you should think something similar for ironstone Caspiche. So the concept is one concentrated shade infrastructure, one tailings facility, and combining those two projects with the idea of eliminating a significant amount of the upfront capital and realizing the operating synergies. So as we mentioned earlier, it’s early stages in the project. We’re working great with the Barrick team, pulling a well experienced team together to head us up. And look forward to updating the market in due course. But think about one concentrator being fed from two mines, and tailings going to a single facility, hence elimination of duplicate infrastructure. We have a significant exploration focus that Paul’s team is leading beyond the known mineralization to date on a number of targets there. Either through lack of funding in the downturns, we never followed up on. So we feel very excited about the longer-term potential. But the idea right now is to combine those two oxide projects and two sulfide projects into one project all at NuevaUnion.
John Bridges: So you’re talking about going big from the get-go, whereas a lot of the former big projects are now being scoped down into a Phase 1 project to get them moving, is that right?
Russ Ball: Not necessarily. We’re obviously going to look at an approach, and NAV won’t be the only driver. Generally, NAV drives you to those bigger circuits. But we think there’s an opportunity to stage this as well and look at potentially phased implementations and minimize the CapEx. All of those options are on the table, including the three sulphide and oxide leach facility because both of them have significant oxide caps sitting on top of them.
John Bridges: Right, right. Okay, cool. Best of luck, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Tumazos: Thank you very much. In the Investor Day earlier this year, the Cerro Negro manager talked about increasing the development rate ramp up production. And the Éléonore mine manager talked about the miners being more productive to offset the narrower structures. Could you give us a progress report in terms of the improvement in development meters or relevant per activity?
Todd White: Sure. Yes, this is Todd. So Cerro Negro, I would say, we are currently right about – a little bit – right at 20 meters a day development, which is on pace with where we expect to be at this point. So again, I’d say, very pleased with where we are there. At Éléonore, we’re developing over 50 meters a day right now, as we develop that lower half of that mine and bringing Horizon 5 forward. Again, I think, the productivities, I think, in both of the sites are on track with where we are expect them to be. No issues that I see and I’m very pleased that we’re on track.
John Tumazos: If I could ask another question to David.
David Garofalo: Go ahead, John.
John Tumazos: There is 19 stocks of interest that had their earnings calls today, 10 or 11 are Canadian mining companies. I know you’ve worked with a couple of different companies. Do you think you guys could all get together and not report the same morning?
David Garofalo: I agree with you.
John Tumazos: And not to put it on you, but International Paper, ArcelorMittal Steel, Fortescue Metals, there’s a whole bunch of companies that are veritable companies, Reliance Steel, Vale, not even in the Canadian circles. Now I know you guys don’t all get together at somebody’s golf tournament and plan this. But the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the last month of July, October, January, and April tends to be a little bit crowded. And I know you guys can take a little bit of the effort off of us and help us.
David Garofalo: Yes, I’m absolutely sympathetic. I can’t promise anything for October because our board meetings are locked in, and obviously, our board members come from far and wide. But we’ll try to do a better job of that for 2018. I do take that on board. It’s – I can imagine that both sell side and buy side, their hair’s on fire this time of the quarter with all these results coming in from left, right and center. So I do sympathize. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I’d like to turn the meeting back over to Garofalo.
David Garofalo: Thank you very much, everybody, for your kind attention. Each of our management team remains available for any follow-up questions. Etienne, myself, anybody else, please don’t hesitate to call us. And we’ll talk to you soon. Thank you for your attention.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Newmont First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide 2, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or you can refer to our SEC filings, which are found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. We made a strong start to the year and our team continued to improve our performance and outlook by running safe and progressively more efficient operations, advancing our best near and long-term growth options and significantly increasing free cash flow and dividends. I'll turn to highlights on slide 4. Our strategy is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. We advanced on every front during the first quarter. Starting with improving the underlying business, we ran safe and profitable operations, drove all-in sustaining cost to $900 per ounce, below the lower end of our guidance, and produced 1.2 million ounces of gold, and a 9% improvement over the prior year quarter. We also strengthened our portfolio and prospects. Two notable developments included announcing plans to build our Subika Underground mine and mill expansion at Ahafo and reaching an agreement to earn into a newly discovered gold system in the Yukon through exploration investment. We also created value for shareholders and closed the quarter with a robust balance sheet and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.7 times, improved financial performance, including $199 million of free cash flow and $566 million of adjusted EBITDA and a 100% increase in dividends declared. Strong performance starts at our operations. Turning to slide 5. Newmont is one of the safest companies in the mining industry. We had no serious injuries in the first quarter and our teams at KCGM and Long Canyon worked without any injuries. But we had a difficult start to the year in terms of our overall injury rates, primarily related to hand injuries. We're working to reset awareness as an immediate priority and to strengthen our fatality risk management system. Last month, we published our 2016 Sustainability Report, Beyond the Mine, which you can find on our website. Our operations met public targets to improve complaint resolution, concurrent reclamation and local procurement in 2016. And we were honored to be named the mining industry leader by the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the second year in a row. Here too, there is always more to be done and we set the bar higher for 2017. We also made progress on sustainably improving costs. Turning to slide 6. We have reduced our all-in sustaining costs by 23% since 2012. Our teams achieved about two-thirds of those savings through full potential improvements, and the remaining third was due to tailwinds such as favorable oil prices and exchange rates. Full potential is still going strong. And we were able to drive our all-in sustaining costs down to $900 per ounce in the first quarter, putting us below the lower end of our full year guidance of between $940 and $1,000 per ounce. As the year progresses, we will continue to assess guidance. Tom will tell you about some of our latest full potential success stories in a few minutes. Turning to production on slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the first quarter and remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces. We also expect to see production weighted to the second half of the year at Carlin, Tanami and Merian. Our production profile has remained steady at between 4.6 million and 5 million ounces over the last five years. And our current project pipeline gives us the means to continue that trajectory for at least the next seven years as we bring on higher grade, longer life assets. I'll cover our two most recent investments on slide 8. Last month, we received permits. And in the last week, we announced plans to build two Ahafo expansion projects that will improve profitability and mine life. The Subika Underground mine will access higher-grade ore beneath Ahafo's current surface mines. And we expect to produce 1.8 million ounces of gold over an 11-year mine life. The scope includes constructing surface and underground infrastructure to support a mine within the central corridor of the Subika ore-body. The mine will also create a platform to further develop the deposit through exploration to the north, south and at depth. More than 13 kilometers of underground workings have been developed to-date, including four trial stopes. This work gave us the means to optimize the project and our approach. The Ahafo Mill Expansion involves expanding mill capacity by more than 50% to nearly 10 million metric tonnes per year by adding a crusher, grinding mill and leach tanks to the existing circuit. The expansion will improve profitability in three ways: first, by increasing mill throughput as Ahafo transitions to harder ore; second, by bringing lower-grade stockpile processing forward; and third, by supporting further development of Ahafo's underground resource. Turning to how these projects improve value on slide 9. In the first five full years of production, or between 2020 and 2024, the Ahafo expansion projects will increase gold production by about 70% from 2016 actuals to a total of 550,000 to 650,000 ounces per year and lower all-in sustaining costs by about 25% to between $800 and $900 per ounce. Development capital for the two projects is estimated at $300 million to $380 million. And Newmont expects to achieve an internal rate of return greater than 20% at a flat $1,200 gold price. We expect first production from Subika Underground mine in the second half of this year and commercial production in the second half of 2018. The mill will come online the following year with first production expected in the first half of 2019, followed by commercial production in the second half of 2019. Turning to slide 10 to take a closer look at the resource. The Subika Underground mine will access higher-grade ore beneath the economic limits of Ahafo's Subika surface mine. The project is expected to further extend mine life by providing a platform to develop the deposit to the north, south and at depth, as you see here. We believe there is considerable upside potential in the Subika ore-body. The Ahafo region also hosts the Apensu Deeps deposit located about 1.5 kilometers to the north of Subika. Development of Apensu Deeps has advanced to the pre-feasibility study stage and infill drilling is expected to expand mineralization. Moving to Canada on slide 11. Exploration is one of our core competencies and the most cost-effective way we add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In March, we announced an agreement with Goldstrike Resources to explore and develop a new gold system in the Yukon Territory. This agreement was approved by Goldstrike's shareholders last week, securing our right to earn up to 80% equity in the plateau property through exploration investment. This property is a newly discovered gold system, consisting of more than 2,000 claims covering more than 350 square kilometers. Initial drill results are promising and high-grade gold mineralization has been identified over a 50 kilometer strike length. The investment strengthens our long-term growth pipeline and leverages our world-class exploration capabilities. I'll wrap up my comments on the first quarter on slide 12. Strong first quarter performance rests on three key factors. We kept a firm handle on our cost and capital expenditures, which puts us on track to meet or exceed cost and production outlook. Second, we advanced growth projects through our pipeline at a steady pace and added new profitable prospects to replenish it. And finally, third, we maintained the financial flexibility we need to continue making value-accretive investments and returning cash to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy for financial results on slide 13.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Gary. Turning to slide 14 for first quarter financial highlights. Revenue increased by 13%, primarily due to higher volumes and prices with new production at Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor and Long Canyon. Adjusted net income was also up slightly as higher revenues more than offset slightly higher unit costs. Adjusted EBITDA improved by 20% or $96 million to $566 million. Cash from continuing operations more than doubled on higher EBITDA and free cash flow increased by over $320 million to $199 million as the Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor and Long Canyon development projects were completed and began commercial production. I'll turn to slide 15 to review adjustments to our GAAP net income. Starting on the left, net income per share was $0.13 for the first quarter. We adjusted net income by $0.02 for minor restructuring and remediation charges and by $0.10 related to certain tax items, primarily a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.25 per share, which also resulted in an adjusted effective tax rate of 30% for the quarter, in line with our guidance. Turning to capital priorities on slide 16. Operational execution, capital discipline and a strong portfolio continue to give us the foundation to execute our capital priorities. These priorities are to fund profitable growth, maintain an industry-leading balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. We have the financial flexibility to self-fund profitable projects such as the Subika Underground mine and the Ahafo Mill Expansion and invest in extending our resource base. We strengthened our investment grade balance sheet in the first quarter by adding more than $160 million of cash, bringing our cash on hand to $2.9 billion and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to just 0.7 times. We anticipate further reducing our debt when our $575 million convertible notes come due in July of this year. And we doubled our quarterly dividend payout ratio to – payout to $0.05 per share in line with our new dividend policy, which came into effect at the beginning of this year. Summing it up, we made a strong start to 2017 and we intend to build on that momentum through ongoing cost and capital discipline, superior operational execution and solid financial management. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tom Palmer to cover regional highlights starting on page 17.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. We delivered strong operational performance in the first quarter against the backdrop of challenging conditions. This performance highlights the value of managing a geographically diverse portfolio. In terms of challenges, we experienced record rainfall in Australia, Peru and Suriname and continue to work through the impact of the slip at our Silverstar mine in Nevada late last year. On the positive side, our teams delivered exceptional results at Akyem and Ahafo in Africa and Cripple Creek & Victor and Long Canyon in North America. Our results also benefited from lower direct operating costs and lower sustaining and development capital spend. Development capital will pick up now that we've resumed construction at Tanami and given Ahafo the green light to build their expansion projects. Turning to North America on slide 18. Long Canyon continues its smooth ramp-up to full production. The team launched full potential shortly after reaching commercial production and is working to improve costs and efficiency on multiple fronts. Cripple Creek & Victor is also harnessing full potential to deliver productivity improvements. The team has made good progress in improving whole truck payloads and fleet reliability in the mine and is currently optimizing ore blend and grant size to further improve throughput and recovery in the mill. At Carlin, we experienced some setbacks due to the geotechnical issues I mentioned earlier, but we remain confident in our ability to fill the gap by processing stockpiled ore and leveraging the region's four other operating assets, which are all outperforming. We continue to make good progress on ground control at Leeville and have largely addressed the backlog of rehabilitation work. At Silverstar, we're conducting geotechnical drilling to determine options to get back into the pit. And if we did, this would represent upside in 2018 and 2019. We'll conduct our annual planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. And we expect that to take about four weeks as we upgrade our gas filtration system along with the usual maintenance activities. Looking forward, we continue to make good progress at our Northwest Exodus Expansion. We expect to approve the Twin Underground in the second half of the year. This project will leverage existing infrastructure and resources to extract ore from below Twin Creeks Vista Pit. And we continue to advance our Long Canyon Phase 2 project. Turning to South America on slide 19. As I mentioned earlier, South America is one of the regions that experienced severe weather conditions during the quarter. At Merian, the team is working to overcome the impact of wet conditions in the mine. And we're very pleased with the throughput and recoveries we're seeing at the mill. We're also on schedule to install a primary crusher and associated infrastructure at Merian. This work will be completed by the end of 2018 when we expect to reach fresh rock in the mine. In Peru, severe weather caused a state of emergency in several parts of the country. Our team has been helping with recovery efforts and Newmont and its employees have donated nearly $60,000 to the Red Cross to support those efforts. Whilst we experienced some supply issues at Yanacocha due to road damage on the coast, we've had no major operational disruptions. We also reached new labor agreements with the two unions that operate at Yanacocha. These unions represent about 30% of our total workforce. Looking to the future, we expect to reach a decision on developing the Quecher Main oxide deposit in the second half of 2017. This project could sustain average annual production of around 200,000 ounces on a consolidated basis from 2020 through 2025 and is not included in our current guidance. Finally, work to optimize the Yanacocha sulfides project is going well. We continue to see good results from exploration drilling in the Chaquicocha decline and from our autoclave pilot tests. We're also receiving good feedback from our engagement with local communities to support ongoing operations at Yanacocha. This project could come online in the early 2020s and extend profitable production for more than 15 years. Turning to Australia on slide 20. Extreme weather has had a major impact on the region's first quarter results. Record rainfall in the northern part of Australia throughout December, January and February resulted in a one-month shutdown at Tanami. You can see from the photo that the Tanami track looked more like a river. As I advised last quarter, we have accounted for this impact in our 2017 guidance. At Tanami, we safely resumed operations in March and the regional team is focusing on opportunities to mitigate the impacts and meet 2017 commitments. Full potential continues to deliver results with Boddington achieving record mill throughput for the month of March. Turning to growth, the Tanami Expansion project was also impacted by severe rainfall, but work has ramped back up and we remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2017. We're also advancing the Morrison layback at KCGM and we reached a decision to proceed in the fourth quarter. We experienced a slip on the west wall of KCGM Fimiston Pit late last month. We're still assessing the impact but do not expect it to have a material impact on net Newmont's outlook. Finally, we promoted Alex Bates to lead our Australia region earlier this year. Alex joined Newmont in 2015 to lead our Boddington operation, which has made significant strides in improving safety, cost and productivity and he brings more than 25 years' experience to his new role. Turning to Africa on slide 21. Africa was our top-performing region for the first quarter of the year. Gary has covered our most exciting news. We're also able to share with the President of Ghana that we are moving forward with the Subika Underground mine and the Ahafo Mill Expansion and express our appreciation to his support when he visited Ahafo last week. I'm also pleased to report that we reached fair and equitable labor agreements with the unions that represent our workforce for 2016 and 2017. These factors and our stable investment agreement continue to make Ghana a good place for Newmont to do business. Ahafo and Akyem achieved exceptionally strong results for the quarter. And the team continues to deliver improvements in the mines and in mill throughput and recovery through our Full Potential program. Looking to the future, we are progressing the next phase of stripping at Ahafo to access higher grades beginning in 2019. And we're advancing our promising Ahafo North project, which is located approximately 30 kilometers north of our existing operations and encompasses 15 deposits along a 12-kilometer strike length. With that, I'll turn back to Gary on slide 22.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Tom. Turning to the future on slide 23, our portfolio is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia, which are among the most favorable mining jurisdictions in the world. Improved margins at our newest mines are helping to offset stripping campaigns at our more mature assets and we continue to develop and improve high margin, long life projects to sustain future production. These factors position us to maintain stable production over the next decade and beyond. Turning to our project pipeline on slide 24. Newmont's project pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. This gives us the flexibility to maintain production levels, while growing margins and mine life. The projects that are included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Tanami Expansion and Morrison in Australia; Northwest Exodus in Nevada; and the Subika Underground mine and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana. The midterm projects that will improve our cost and production outlook are shown in green. These include the Twin Underground in Nevada and Quecher Main in Peru. With the exception of Ahafo North, we expect to approve these projects during the course of this year. Finally, we continue to invest in our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. Our focus on long-term value creation shows up in our leading reserve profile. Turning to slide 25. Over the last 16 years, we've added more than 123 million ounces to our reserve base, all by the drill bit and at a cost just $24 per ounce. And just over half the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our industry-leading reserve profile includes 129 ounces per 1,000 shares and operating reserve life of almost 12 years. And, as I mentioned, more than 70% of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We have a proven track record of converting about 80% of our resources into reserves. And this year, we plan to invest more than $200 million in our exploration program to build on that success. Turning to our long-term production profile on slide 26. As you can see, Newmont has a stable long-term asset base with considerable upside from its leading project pipeline. Our gold production profile is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces for the foreseeable future. And we continue to advance our mid and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years. We've provided a seven-year view here in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation and we believe this outlook differentiates us from our competitors. Let me emphasize that when we talk about growth, we are referring to growing margins, reserves and resources. Our work to develop a portfolio of lower cost, longer life assets is paying off and we'll continue this trajectory by taking a fit for purpose approach to developing our projects, weighing multiple options to improve risk and return, delivering projects safely on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget and continuing to invest in early stage and exploration opportunities. Turning to slide 27 for more detail on our guidance. We're updating our outlook to reflect improvements associated with our Ahafo expansion projects. Our attributable gold production guidance increases by 100,000 ounces in 2018 and by 200,000 ounces in 2019 through 2021. And our all-in sustaining cost guidance decreases by $10 per ounce in 2019 through 2021. Our development capital outlook now includes our investments at Ahafo and our exploration budget remains stable at around $200 million. Finally, our advanced projects guidance of between $125 million and $175 million in 2017 is earmarked for our mid and long-term projects. These include Long Canyon Phase 2, Yanacocha sulfides, Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North. As a reminder, we do not include projects in our outlook until we've reached a decision to fund them. Our goal is to be the most profitable and responsible miner in the gold sector and we're making steady progress. Turning to slide 28. Four years ago, we launched a new strategic direction and a new era of productivity, performance and growth at Newmont. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our proven strategy. To improve the underlying business, we will reinforce our culture of prioritizing value over volume, build on our track record of continuous cost and efficiency improvement and maintain a world-class asset portfolio where we have the relationships and stability needed to deliver leading results. To strengthen our portfolio, we'll continue to grow margins, reserves and resources; sustain a robust project pipeline and deliver them on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget; and leverage our exploration expertise and proprietary technologies to develop the next generation of profitable mines. Finally, to create superior shareholder value, we'll continue to exercise discipline in all of our investments, maintain our industry-leading balance sheet and uphold our long-standing track record of paying dividends and ensuring that our investors reap the rewards of rising gold prices. Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call now over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Well done and a strong quarter. My first questions, I guess, are on the costs. First of all, your corporate expenses, G&A exploration, cash taxes were below, I guess, what I would have expected as the normal run rate. Part one of the question is, is it reasonable to assume that these will escalate over the course of the year? And then, secondly, just want to understand a little more fully the – in the face of weather-related issues and some of the operating issues at the mines, you delivered CAS costs of $687, well below the guidance and ASIC (sic) [AISC] of $900, well below your guidance. Can you talk a little bit about where you see those costs going forward through the course of 2017? Do you expect grades to decline on average so that costs would rise to within those ranges you gave us guidance? Or do you expect that using or through the Full Potential initiative that you'll be able to revise guidance over the course of the year lower with respect to costs?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Thanks for both those sets of questions. I'll have Nancy Buese cover the corporate costs that you asked about first and then I'll hand over to Tom to cover the operating cost position.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Stephen, our Q1 SG&A came in about $55 million, which would put us near the lower end of the guidance range for the year. We anticipate that's probably where we'll end up. We are continuing to be very cost conscious at corporate as we are focusing on cost at the sites and with our Full Potential program. So we've employed the same strategies here as well. So I think it's fair to assume we'll be at or around the lower end of that guidance range for the year.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you, Nancy.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Tom Palmer here. We'll certainly see our production weighted more to the second half, as Gary mentioned, Tanami, as we move into some higher grade stopes and bring on the expansion project. Carlin certainly weighted to the second half of the year as we move through the mill shutdown at Carlin this quarter. And Merian will be weighted to the second half of the year as well. So, we'll see some more production come through, which is going to help unit costs. But we're also going to be spending more through Q2 and Q3 on explorations, so as we get that program up and running and been impacted a little bit by the weather and our sustaining capital spend as well. So we're working to drive and manage those costs, but I think we will see those come a bit higher but remain within guidance through the remaining part of the year.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for that, Tom. If I might ask another question, just on reclamation provisions for Yanacocha. Just there's a comment in the MD&A that the revised closure plan may require the company to provide additional bonding for Yanacocha. And if I back up through some of the disclosure you talk about having submitted to the government the revised modifications, the EIA that incorporate the requirements, the revised requirements for water treatment. And in the last call, you talked a little bit about the provisions for Yanacocha did not include some of the sulfides. Long question, I guess, what I'm asking is what do you anticipate the reclamation closure cost for Yanacocha could be? What sort of ranges could be? I think the last guidance we had was slightly over $1 billion on 100% basis. If you incorporate what's required for water treatment, if you incorporate either with the sulfides or without the sulfides, what do you think that that range of reclamation can be? And, again, I understand it's very early, but if you have any preliminary ranges that would be very helpful.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Stephen, where we're at – what's reflected in our numbers that you're referring to is related to what we've actually opened up and disturbed in terms of disturbed land. So in regards to things like Quecher Main, which is primarily on our existing footprint and even the Yanacocha sulfides, which is primarily on our existing footprint, we haven't included anything for those projects. Likewise, we haven't included any benefit from work we may do as we develop those projects to reduce the costs. And we are continuing – and I think that was the point we made here at the end of last year. We're continuing to do study work around water treatment in ways we might mitigate and reduce those costs. At the end of the year, we had to put forward what we knew at that time was our best estimate, so that's what's reflected there. But Tom and his team – in fact, I'm down to Peru later this week to catch up with the team – continue to work on ways to reduce that long-term cost as we look at the opportunities to develop both Quecher Main and the Yanacocha sulfide deposits. So we do have an update that we need to provide in terms of cost to the government as part of our normal process. And we have to obviously warn to where potential things or things could go, but a lot of work is being done to look at ways to try to reduce it. But given where we're at now, that's the range that you see is reflecting our current operations.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and team. I've got a couple of questions on your newer assets. Just looking at Long Canyon, the kind of mining rate and stacking rate there is somewhat higher than what I'd anticipated, which is good obviously, but just wondering, if you could give us some guidance as to what you'd expect that rate to be going forward. Whether it will continue to at this level or increase or decrease?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. I'm going to hand over to Tom Palmer to address that.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David. Looking at over the years we're mining Phase 1 at Long Canyon, those rates remain pretty stable over the life of that Phase 1 mine. So the rates you're seeing now – we're still ramping up that leach pad, so we're still going to be seeing some buildup. But the sorts of mining rates that I'm looking at for this year and then continuing for the next few years are pretty consistent.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So around 1 million metric tonnes per quarter is what you'd achieved in March. Is that something we could think about going forward?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. That looks about right.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And can you just walk us through what your expectation is for Phase 2 at Long Canyon?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I'd be happy to cover that off, David. We're continuing to do drilling off the deposit and still haven't closed it out in any direction. Most likely and as we go through the permitting process, we'll be going below the water table. We'll be assessing options to go underground. We're finding good intercepts. I don't think we have it in today's pack but in the past, we've had some of the intercept show up the geological cross-sections showing some pretty good grades at depth there. So we'll be assessing whether the next phase would be an underground mine or an extension of the current open pit or maybe some combination. The other thing we'll be assessing is the – whether we go – continue with the leach process. We haven't come across any of the complex sulfides that you see elsewhere in Nevada. So this is all amenable to leach. But we'll be assessing whether a mill makes sense and whether that fits into the next phase. So it's still early days in that whole assessment. Water and going below the water table is a key part of the need to understand the hydrology, so doing a lot of work on modeling the hydrology there and understanding how we handle the water and how we manage the water there is a key focus for the project right now. We're still several years away as we go through pre-feas and feasibility with that project.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And just on the topic of new projects, we got Quecher Main and Twin Underground pending your approval. What are you waiting for before you press the button for the approval? Is it just sort of short of your hurdle rate? Or is it just a degree of prudence on making sure you can execute?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's really the latter. In terms of going through our investment process, having the engineering work done to the level that we're comfortable bringing it forward for approval. I think permitting-wise in both cases, we sit in pretty good shape. So unlike where we had the delay at Subika Underground for the permit, these have the permits. It's just working through our investment process. And as Tom mentioned, we'd be looking to bring those forward later in the year.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Gary, and thank you, Tom.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anita Soni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask a question with regards to KCGM. I think you said that you have not assessed the impact yet but would have a material effect. So, is that with respect to your overall guidance that it wouldn't have an impact on the overall guidance because I think Barrick has come out with a number, which was about 30,000 to 10,000 ounces down?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. That's correct. In regards to our overall guidance, we don't see an effect at this stage but would be not far off. The 30,000 is our attributable amount there. 60,000 is the consolidated impact that we see at this stage, though it's still early days and we're looking at ways to mitigate that.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: And I guess there's also a mill shutdown that occurred as well there. And I just wanted to get an idea of how the production evolves given the pit wall and also the mill shutdown that's going on over the course of the year. So, Q2 really low and then Q3 and Q4 rebound? Or is it sort of an even spread over the course of the year?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I hand over for Tom to handle that one.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Anita, and good morning. The mill shutdown was really part of planned maintenance program. In terms of the slip in the pit, I think, the fire mechanisms are well understood and we believe we've reached out our fault limits. So we're looking at – as we work through that plan, it's a fairly modest delighting and un-lighting exercise we have to do at the top of that pit wall. It's an oxide material. So we're working through that process. It'll take – it's obviously impacted through April as we've worked to understand. I would expect to see Q2 numbers from KCGM impacted a bit by this. But the second half of the year shouldn't be impacted by this event. And, as Gary indicated, the numbers that you quoted are the numbers we're seeing in terms of impact – still assessing impact on KCGM. At this stage, we're seeing it towards the lower end of our guidance on KCGM.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to come back to the operations if I could and maybe ask Tom. You gave some guidance following Steve's question on how does the year shape up production second half weighted. You mentioned Carlin, the roster is down for maintenance in Q2 and then we have Merian ramping up in the second half of the year. Just on the costing side, is it correct that at Boddington the stripping increase is set throughout the year and that's going to have an impact on your costs as you go through 2017?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tanya. Yeah. At Boddington, in particular, is we're doing the strip of the SO5 (39:48) layback there. We'll start to see that strip ratio increase in the fourth quarter. So we'll see an impact of that in the second half of the year.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. So the costs will go up there. And is that the same at Ahafo also? Is stripping happening there? Or was it just grade-related that we see? Just on the costing front, I thought we were expecting to see higher costs in Ahafo in the second half of the year.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. At Ahafo, we'll see some grade decline at Ahafo as we mine out the current size of the Amoma pit, the major impact there. And we'll start to see some Subika Underground ore coming as well.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. And can you remind me of the grade at the Subika Underground?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's around just under 5 grams per tonne.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. So with the exception of the Boddington and Ahafo, does Akyem go through also harder-grade ore in the second half of the year that causes the costs to go up there also? Just remind me if that's still happening.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: No. There is no real change in hardness of the ore at Akyem. We will start – as you get deeper in the Akyem mine, you start to see the grade profile decline. So we'll start to see in the second half a bit of a grade decline as we move through Akyem and we'd probably move through some of the high grade stockpiles.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: So if I was to understand correctly then, the mines that we would see sort of higher cost coming in, in the second half of the year would be maybe Boddington, Ahafo? Would those be the two major ones?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. I think that's reasonable, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. And then obviously higher costs for Carlin continuing in Q2, because of the roster shutdown or maintenance?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. That's right.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: And sorry, and is there any difference between Q3 or Q4? Is it weighted to a stronger Q4 or are Q3 and Q4 relatively the same?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Reasonably flat across the second half of the year.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. Okay. Well, that's helpful. Hopefully I'll get it right. Thank you very much.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good luck, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Gary, everybody. Congratulations on the results. I see in your conceptual scoping portion of your project pipeline, you have Akyem underground. Conceptually, could we look forward to that being another Subika – a mirror image of Subika in a few years' time?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think it's early days yet. We've done quite a bit of drilling and continue to do the drilling there. I'm probably a little more excited at this stage just because we've got the underground development going on at Subika, about Apensu Deeps. But I've got Grigore Simon here, Head of Exploration. He might want to expand on how he sees Akyem.
Grigore Simon - Newmont Mining Corp.: Hi, John. This is Grigore. To answer your question, Akyem is quite different than Subika in terms of the geology and what controls the mineralization. Akyem is much more structurally controlled than Subika. So there are some differences there. In terms of the potential of the two areas, I think, Subika has more potential than Akyem. And in terms of the first resource at Akyem, I think, you should expect to see it for the underground at the end of this year.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Because I remember when we visited there was some very interesting drill intercepts for both Subika and Akyem underground?
Grigore Simon - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. That's correct. The intercepts are there. The ounces are there. We are working right now through the scoping study at Akyem underground. You have already seen the results at Subika that we are going ahead with the development there for the 1.5 million ounce of reserves. If you are looking at the indicated and inferred you have another 1.5 million. And I think it's much more to come, not this year because this year we had some issues in terms of being able to drill underground because of the permit. But as of next year, you should start seeing again quite a ramp-up in terms of reserves and resource at both Subika and Akyem.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, Grigore. Good luck.
Grigore Simon - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Gary, I'm still really fuzzy on the Yanacocha sulfides, what it means, what you're doing there and what the conceptual plan is over the medium term.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. Happy. It's still in pre-feasibility, so it's early stage. We've given some very high-level coverage in terms of its deposit. That's roughly 50% gold, 40% copper, 10% silver in terms of where the revenues have come from. But we've been really working through – the big challenge with it. It's a good quality – we added to the resource at the end of 2016 good quality copper gold deposit with a very low strip ratio. The challenge is how we manage the arsenic and the ore. And it's variable throughout different parts. Some parts of the copper gold have higher arsenic, some have lower. And we've been testing really a variety of different methods in terms of copper recovery from the sulfides. We've been testing bio leaching. That process has looked very good in terms of recovery rates and potential economic viability. When it comes to the sulfide copper gold, we've been really testing two processes. You can make a good concentrate but then it's how you process that concentrate and store the arsenic safely. We've been testing with Buenaventura and more atmospheric leach process to see whether that can provide good recoveries. That's probably been a little less successful at this stage. We've been doing testing with autoclave technology and done pilot testing in the labs here in Denver and have had really very good success with both gold and copper recovery. So that to me is encouraging for a stage for development of this deposit. We continue to do drilling around the deposit to better understand and differentiate those different elements. And we're still a couple of years away from be at a point where we can make a final investment decision. I've given ranges before of $1.8 billion to $2 billion sort of an investment for this. And that's really where we're at, still high level in terms of the numbers. As we progress through our project assessment phase and as we have a pretty rigorous approach to that here at Newmont and like to keep that because it gets us better results we'll give more information on that deposit.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. Do you think you're about a year, year and a half away from moving it into feasibility type of studies there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think we're still in the year to two years out – year and half to two years out, so probably take the longer end of that side right now.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. That's very helpful.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Great. Thanks, Greg.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Tom, just a couple of questions, if I might. First of all, KCGM. The Morrison extension, my understanding, this is a fairly significant layback over the next two years, possibly three years. Can you give us a sense on timing and capital on 100% basis?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. So Morrison – you're looking at in terms – you're looking in the order of $100 million for the capital cost to that layback. And we'd be aiming to approve that in the latter part of this year and achieve commercial production in 2019.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And then for the remainder of the pit itself or the primary pit itself, there's also another layback that potentially could be – that could extend the ore-body that is necessary to continue mining at that ore-body. So is there another significant layback that would have to be approved at some point at KCGM?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Stephen, we're certainly exploring that. We think there's some opportunity there at KCGM and that even around that Morrison layback where the opportunities for further layback sit around Morrison. So we're still pretty actively looking at other opportunities around that pit.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Would they be adding additional reserves or converting resources to reserves? Or are they already in the existing reserve estimate for the deposit?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: They would be a combination of reserves that we convert and the drilling program that we'd need to do to approve those as the ounces out.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And that timing with that would be within the next 12 months or 24 months to 36 months? What sort of timing could that take?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I'd look at this sort of over the next two-year timeframe as doing further work on what those opportunities might look like and what that drilling program might look like.
Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gary Goldberg, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you and thank you all for joining the call this morning. We started 2017 from a position of strength and built on that foundation in the first quarter by delivering 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $900 per ounce, putting us on track to meet guidance. The next wave of growth projects with approval of Subika Underground mine and Ahafo Mill Expansion and the next generation of growth prospects through our plateau agreement and improved financial results through $199 million in free cash flow, $566 million in adjusted EBITDA and a 100% increase in dividends. We also strengthened our ability to deliver our strategy by forging solid labor agreements and stakeholder relationships; maintaining superior environmental, social and governance performance; and developing one of the strongest teams in the mining industry. Thank you for joining us and have a safe day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, and you may begin.
Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website, newmont.com. And now, I will turn it over to Gary on slide 3.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Meredith, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Our overarching goal is to create shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. Today, we'll cover what we did to make Newmont a more reliable and profitable business in 2016 and what we're doing to build on that trajectory in the years ahead. Common themes include running safe operations that meet the highest sustainability standards, applying best practices and technologies to improve costs, investing to strengthen our portfolio and reserve base and generating superior returns. We'll deliver this performance by continuing to execute our strategy, turning to slide 4. Our strategy is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. In 2016, we improved our business by maintaining low injury rates and no fatalities, reducing gold all-in sustaining costs for the fourth consecutive year and increasing attributable gold production to 4.9 million ounces. We strengthened our portfolio by building two new mines, Merian and Long Canyon, in two perspective new gold districts; advancing profitable expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami and Carlin; adding 10 million higher grade ounces to our reserve and resource base; and selling PTNNT for $920 million in gross cash proceeds. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us create value by doubling free cash flow to $784 million, increasing adjusted EBITDA to $2.4 billion and improving cash on hand to $2.8 billion. We also improved share price by 89% and doubled our dividend payout. Strong performance starts at our operations, turning to slide 5. I'll point out two milestones that our team reached in 2016. First, we lowered our serious injury rate by 75%. This translated to only 2 serious injuries across our workforce of 28,000 people, good progress but 2 injury is too many. Second, we are rated the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year running and recognized with the most improved performance. This year, we'll continue to lower safety risks, including fatigue, by focusing on improving behaviors and systems. We're providing training to our drivers and installing monitors in our haul trucks to alert them to the onset of fatigue. Our team at Carlin piloted the technology before we invested and reported an 87% decrease in fatigue-related events. Operational excellence also shows up in our cost performance, turning to slide 6. We have steadily reduced our all-in sustaining costs by a total of 22% since 2012. This include – excludes PTNNT. Nearly 2/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements supported by our Full Potential program. Our team has defined and delivered thousands of improvements through Full Potential, and the program is still going strong. We also rely on relevant technology to improve productivity. Automation and analytics are already delivering improvements, and there is more to come. Turning to our portfolio on slide 7. Comparing our divestments to our investments over the last three years, we've been able to lower unit costs by more than $100 per ounce and double mine life. Divestments culminated in 2016 with the sale of PTNNT for a total value of $1.3 billion. This includes up to $403 million in contingent payments associated with copper price and future development. Our portfolio is now anchored in four key regions, where we have the stability needed to continue investing over time. Turning to recent investments on slide 8. Last year, we built an even stronger record of delivering profitable projects, when most miners were delaying their capital spend. Our team built the first phase of Long Canyon safely, two months ahead of schedule and $50 million below budget. Taking a phased approach helped us to generate a greater than 26% rate of return and reduced the payback period to about four years. At Northwest Exodus and Tanami, we advanced extensions that will add profitable production and mine life and serve as platforms for further growth. Both projects are expected to generate returns in excess of 30% at current gold prices. Merian is another success story, turning to slide 9. We made our first investment in 2004 as a development partner with Alcoa. Since then, our geologists have grown the reserve and resource base to 5 million ounces. The government of Suriname acquired a 25% interest in 2014. More recently, we signed a development agreement with indigenous Pamakkan people. Finally, we delivered the first phase of Merian on schedule and more than $150 million below budget last year, and we continue to see promising exploration results. This is a great example of the type of long-term investments we will continue to pursue. Turning to slide 10 for more on exploration. In 2016, we added 4.1 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit with particularly strong results at Tanami and Merian, and we improved the reserve grade by 13% through high-grade additions and the sale of PTNNT. These additions helped to partially offset depletion of 6 million ounces and divestment of 2.6 million ounces. We also added 6.1 million ounces to our resource base, including 2 million ounces at our Yanacocha sulfides project, which is showing increasing promise. In 2017, we expect to boost our exploration and advanced projects expenditure by 22%. About 2/3 of that increase will pay for more our brownfields and greenfields exploration. About 1/3 will fund studies for the next-generation projects like Yanacocha sulfides, Long Canyon Phase 2 and the next expansion at Tanami. Turning to slide 11 for a look at the global business. We ended 2016 with a streamlined portfolio of cash-generating operations, a proven approach to improving costs and productivity and profitable options to expand mature mines and new gold districts in the Americas and to develop extensive underground resources in Africa and Australia. We also ended the year with nearly 3/4 of our gold reserves in the U.S. and Australia. Finally, our 29% holding in TMAC is not represented on this map or included in our reserves. But I'd like to congratulate Terry and the team at TMAC in Canada who poured their first gold earlier this month. With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy for financial results on slide 12.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Gary. As many of you know, I joined Newmont late last year. I've been on the job for just over three months and have had the opportunity to visit two of our regions and meet many of our people. What stands out so far is the commitment to safety that permeates the business and the sense of pride and ownership people take in our performance and future prospects. Newmont is a great place to work, and I'm proud to be a part of the team. I'll turn now to our fourth quarter financial performance on slide 13. We saw significant improvement in our financial position compared to the prior-year quarter. Gold production rose 17% with increases at most of our operations and new ounces from Merian and Long Canyon. All-in sustaining cost declined 11% through a continued focus on improving operational effectiveness and cost efficiency, and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $629 million. We also improved free cash flow by more than 200% to $289 million. I'll turn to slide 14 to review adjustments to our GAAP net income and EBITDA. Starting at the top, net loss per share, excluding PTNNT, was $0.73 for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income per share was impacted by three factors. First, we adjusted out the impairment charge at Yanacocha, which totaled $0.63 per share. As we announced last December, we're completing a comprehensive update of our closure plan at Yanacocha and have increased our cost estimate to cover higher water management requirements. As a result, we increased our reclamation liability and recorded an impairment. We had originally indicated an impairment range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion and came in just below that range at $970 million, as we updated our assumptions. Second, we adjusted out $0.22 for certain tax items, including the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. Third, we adjusted out $0.13 related to a book loss on debt repayment and non-cash reclamation expense. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.25 per share, up $0.28 from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $629 million reflects the same drivers. Turning to full year results on slide 15. Strong operational performance drove a 7% increase in attributable gold production and a 2% improvement in AISC year-on-year. This translated to exceptional financial performance, including an 89% increase in adjusted net income to $619 million, a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $2.4 billion and more than doubling our free cash flow to $789 million (sic) [$784 million] (11:12). Turning to slide 16 and our full year adjustments. Net loss excluding PTNNT was $0.41 per share for 2016. Our full year adjusted net income of $1.16 per share was impacted by two factors. The adjustment for the Yanacocha impairment I discussed earlier totaled $0.63 per share, and adjustments related to valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets totaled $0.94 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the year reflects impairment and reclamation charges related to Yanacocha closure estimates, loss on debt repayment and reversing a net gain on asset sales, as well as some other items. Turning to slide 17. As Gary mentioned, performance and portfolio improvements have given us the means to execute our capital priorities, which are to fund profitable growth, maintain industry-leading financial flexibility and return cash to shareholders. In 2016, we generated $1.1 billion through asset sales and increased our cash on hand to $2.8 billion. Our nearly $6 billion of liquidity includes a $3 billion undrawn revolver and allows us to invest in our best growth options and to pursue opportunistic M&A. We've also reduced our net debt by 2/3 over the last three years, resulting in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.8 times and making our investment-grade balance sheet one of the strongest in the industry. Finally, our fourth quarter dividend doubled compared to the prior-year quarter, and we enhanced our dividend policy to improve shareholder returns at the higher gold prices beginning in 2017. We are confident in our ability to generate cash through the cycle, so we also increased the payout at lower gold prices. Wrapping up my comments on slide 18. Consistently strong performance and a steady focus on value creation continued to differentiate Newmont in 2016. We ended the year with $1.47 in free cash flow per share and an 89% increase in share price, both well above the sector average. With that, I'll hand the call back to Gary on slide 19.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Nancy. Summing up 2016, we did what we said we would do and delivered sector-leading performance, portfolio improvements and value. We also recognize that we have to continuously improve our record to stay in the lead. Switching gears now to the future on slide 20. Our five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs and ongoing investment in profitable growth. Lower-cost production from our newest mines will partially offset the impacts of inventory adjustments and stripping campaigns at our more mature assets. We also expect to increase spending on the next generation of growth prospects, while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. Taken together, these factors position us to maintain strong performance over the next decade and beyond. Turning to our project pipeline on slide 21. Newmont's project pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. This gives us the flexibility to main (14:25) production levels while growing margins and mine life. The projects that are included in our outlook are the current projects and sustaining capital projects you see here. These are the Tanami Expansion and Morrison in Australia, Northwest Exodus and Goldstar in Nevada. The mid-term projects that will improve our cost and production outlook are shown in green. These include the Ahafo Mill Expansion, Subika Underground and Ahafo North in Ghana, Twin Underground in Nevada and Quecher Main in Peru. With the exception of Ahafo North, we expect to approve these projects during the course of this year. Finally, we continue to invest on our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. Turning to slide 22 for the production profile associated with this pipeline. As you can see, Newmont has a stable long-term asset base with considerable upside from its industry-leading project pipeline. Our gold production profile is forecast to remain at about 5 million ounces for the foreseeable future, and we continue to advance our mid-term and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years. We've provided a seven-year view here in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation, and we believe this outlook differentiates us from our competitors. Let me reiterate that when we talk about growth, we are referring to growing margins, not ounces. Our work to develop a portfolio of lower-cost, longer-life assets and to generate industry-leading return on capital employed is paying off, and we will continue this trajectory by taking a fit-for-purpose approach to developing our projects, weighing multiple options to improve risk and return, delivering projects safely on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget and continuing to invest in early-stage and exploration opportunities. Turning to slide 23 for more on our guidance. Our current three-year to five-year outlook is for steady production of 4.5 million ounces to 5 million ounces, unchanged from prior guidance. In 2017, we expect gold production to increase to between 4.9 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces, as the full year production for Merian and Long Canyon more than offset lower production at Twin Creeks and Yanacocha. In 2018, production will decline slightly to between 4.6 million ounces and 5.1 million ounces due to higher stripping at Boddington and lower grades at Cripple Creek & Victor, Twin Creeks and Akyem. Both Boddington and Twin Creeks will return to higher production in 2020. Our all-in sustaining cost outlook for 2017 and 2018 is slightly higher, primarily due to recent events but we continue to manage. First, we're working to recover ounces that were impacted by a larger slip in Carlin Silverstar mine in late November. We've taken that production out of guidance for now, and it represents upside for 2018 and 2019. The guidance also reflects the work we've done to fine-tune ground control plans at Leeville. Second, we adjusted our outlook to reflect the impact of record rainfall we've been experiencing at Tanami. The team is implementing recovery plans now. Third, we shifted the allocation of our cost between copper and gold production, starting in 2017. And finally, our increased investment in advanced projects and exploration will raise cost in the near term, as we continue to invest in our ability to generate superior value over time. Our cost outlook for 2019 through 2021 remains between $880 and $980 per ounce. Our sustaining capital spend reflects ongoing investment in our asset base and is expected to rise slightly in 2017 in keeping with prior guidance. This capital will mainly fund the ongoing mine development, tailing storage capacity and equipment rebuilds. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $600 million and $700 million per year, which is favorable to previous guidance due to a mix of sustainable cost savings and deferrals. Development capital outlook for 2017 and 2018 supports our current growth projects. Our guidance does not include projects, unless all studies are complete and full funds are committed. We believe this aligns with how our shareholders think about their investments as well. Our outlook will improve, as we add mid-term projects over the next three years and our longer-term projects thereafter. Likewise, we do not include Full Potential savings past 2017 in our outlook. For the last four years, we've more than offset the impacts of inflation through Full Potential, and we expect this trend to continue. As always, we take a realistic approach to guidance to drive the right focus within Newmont. With that high-level overview, I'll turn it over to Tom on slide 24 for more details on our regional performance and outlook.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary. And I'll start with North America on slide 25. In November 2016, we reached commercial production at Long Canyon, two months ahead of schedule and 20% favorable to budget. We also met our investment case and completed expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor. We improved mill throughput and recoveries in 2016 and expect to further optimize performance through our Full Potential program. And at Carlin, we're funding a profitable extension of our Exodus mine that will reach full production in 2018. As Gary mentioned, we experienced another slip at the Silverstar mine late last year. This prevented us from mining the last ore from this pit in 2016, as expected. We had planned to process some of this ore in the early part of 2017, but have taken those ounces out of guidance for now. This represents upside for 2018 and 2019, as we work through plans to reenter this mine. Also, we continue to make good progress at Leeville. The work we've done to refine our ground control management plans and change our mining method in some areas has been incorporated into our guidance for Carlin. For the North America region, we expect higher production in 2017, as the full year of operations at Long Canyon offset the impact of stripping and processing stockpiles at Twin Creeks. In 2019, you can see the impact of processing stockpiles as we work through stripping campaigns at both Carlin and Twin Creeks. Both sites return to high production levels in 2020. It's also worth noting that we'll continue to see seasonal impacts with Carlin, with production weighted to the second half of the year. Long Canyon is ramping up steadily from its first gold pour in November and its production will also be weighted to the second half of 2017. Finally, we expect to reach a decision on our Twin Creeks Underground mine later this year. Turning to South America on slide 26. We commissioned Merian last October on time and 20% below budget. Merian's lower cost ounces have partially offset declining production at Yanacocha. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha through potential development of the Quecher Main deposit, which could sustain oxide gold production through to 2025. This project is not included in our current guidance, and we expect to reach a decision to move forward later this year. As Gary indicated, we're also advancing our sulfide study at Yanacocha and declared a first resource of 2 million ounces in 2016. Project economics and technical viability continue to improve as we advance work in the Chaquicocha exploration decline and on autoclave testing to optimize our approach to mining and processing sulfide ores. We also continue to evaluate and refine our closure estimates and approach in Peru, whilst preserving optionality for future development. South America production is expected to increase slightly over the next two years, as we hit our stride at Merian. In 2019, you can see the impacts of declining production at Yanacocha and higher stripping at Merian. Costs are projected to remain relatively stable over the next three years. And Full Potential, which we'll launch at Merian this year, represents further upside. Finally, Dean Gehring, an experienced mining leader who joined the Newmont team on June 1 to run our South American business. Dean succeeds Trent Tempel, who is retiring after 33 years of distinguished service with Newmont. Turning to Australia on slide 27. Our team delivered exceptional performance in 2016, driven by record throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong results at Tanami, as they continue to advance their expansion projects. This project adds a second decline to support a step-change in mining rates and build incremental plant capacity to match those rights and improve recoveries. The second decline is in use, and the mill expansion is under construction. As Gary mentioned earlier, progress has been impacted by two months of record rainfall in the Northern part of the Australia, but we remain on track for completion into mid-2017. Turning to the regional outlook. We'll come off record production at Boddington over the next three years, as we move into the next layback. This will impact production and costs before they return to prior levels in 2020. The team expects to improve this outlook through Full Potential and by optimizing the Tanami Expansion Project. We added 1.6 million ounces of reserves at Tanami in 2016, bringing total reserves and resources to 5.6 million ounces. Our outlook also includes increased study cost to advance a promising second expansion at Tanami. Turning to Africa on slide 28. Ahafo and Akyem achieved steady mill throughput and recovery improvements in 2016 and delivered our lowest regional injury rate. Ghana recently elected a new president, and we're encouraged by his willingness to engage and support mining investment. We continue to see Ghana as a good place to do business, and we're making progress on securing the permits we need to expand the mill at Ahafo and build the Subika Underground. When approved, the two projects will add between 225,000 ounces and 300,000 ounces of gold annually and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. As Gary indicated, we expect to reach a decision in the first half of 2017. Both projects represent upside to our current guidance. Otherwise, we expect production to decrease and cost to increase in 2017 and 2018, as you reach harder ore and deplete high-grade stockpiles at Akyem. In 2019, production and cost are forecasted to improve as we reach high-grade ore at Ahafo. With that, I'll hand it back to Gary on slide 29.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tom. We continue to make Newmont a safer and more profitable business in 2016 with differentiated cash flow, financial strengths and growth prospects. We delivered industry-leading safety and sustainability performance at our operations and increased adjusted EBITDA by 25% to $2.4 billion and more than doubled free cash flow to nearly $800 million on the back of superior operational performance. We invested these proceeds back into the business by building two new mines and profitable expansions in the Americas and Australia and adding higher grade ounces to our reserve base. We optimized our portfolio with the sale of our PTNNT stake for $920 million in cash proceeds and we used these proceeds to retire more than $1.3 billion in debt, improving our liquidity and doubling our dividends. Looking ahead, we can't control the gold price, but we can and will work to outperform the gold sector by continuing to meet our challenges head-on and consistently delivering high quality business results, developing profitable projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget, investing in exploration to expand our existing assets and develop the next world-class gold mines and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our ultimate goal is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. We entered 2017 from a position of strength, but we recognized that leadership requires us to consistently meet or exceed our commitments and your expectations. Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back now to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Our first question comes from Andrew Quail, Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Gary and team, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on a strong quarter. One is on – Gary, one is on the projects. First one, I suppose, with the Yanacocha and Quecher Main, can you just tell us how this ties in to what you guys are doing there with the impairment that you guys talked this quarter? And also, maybe, I think Tom was touching on the closure costs. What's actually the current provision there for the reclamation? And I suppose, is this an asset that, when you look forward, if you don't go ahead with something like Quecher Main – I mean, the second half of 2017, is this an asset that you would look to divest?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. A couple of different questions in there. Thanks, Andrew. First of all, on Quecher Main, Quecher Main is an incremental oxide expansion that adds about 200,000 ounces per year of production. Total production, starting from after we approve it, basically gets us from 2019 through 2025. So, it's incremental. And really, the way I've been looking at it, it's a bridge to the development of the bridge to the development of the Yanacocha sulfide. So, it allows us to finish the study work through really the next two-and-a-half, three years on the Yanacocha sulfide, so we're in a position to make an investment decision there. The closure cost estimates are – really, it's an update, primarily water related in terms of the increase to the cost that we've estimated. It does not, at this stage, include Quecher Main either the additional costs that we might incur by operating Quecher Main or the benefit we get by extending the reclamation time. So, that would be something we'd have to update, as we'd approve that project. Same thing with the Yanacocha sulfides. The Yanacocha sulfides both have an impact on reclamation cost, but it also – not only in terms of adding to that, but also would extend when they would occur, so it pushes it out. None of that is included. So, right now, we've just assumed end of mine life at the end of 2019 and all those reclamation costs, and that's why you see some of Yanacocha's costs going up here over the next couple of years, as those additional reclamation costs flowing through to our all-in sustaining costs. In terms of divestiture, your last question, I had a very good meeting with the President when I was down in November. I'm encouraged by the approach he's taking and the approach not just for the country but within the regions and the support and focus that he's placing on regional economies and the importance there. The Cajamarca Province is one that has not benefited as much by the presence of mining, and I think changing things there is important. I'm encouraged by not only Quecher Main, but the Yanacocha sulfides project. And the way that's starting to shape up, it shows really good promise. So, from my standpoint, it's one that we really see good potential in and want to see that full potential through.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the impairment this quarter was related to what exactly?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's a combination of additional – well, we had – we changed the reclamation cost provision and that was primarily due to changes in our view on how we'd have to manage and treat water. That triggered an impairment to our carrying value, so the $920 million...
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Got it. Okay...
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Essentially was triggered by that.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. And the last one is obviously in Africa in Ghana. What would be the final hurdle that you guys have to get over the line to sort of – to approve Subika and Ahafo together? Is it sort of permitting? Or it's obviously – well, it doesn't look like it's economics, given your balance sheet is so strong. Is it – can you just walk us through the final steps?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure thing. And I had the opportunity, and we have a new president in Ghana as well, who was inaugurated in January, and I had the opportunity to meet with him earlier this month. And I came away encouraged about the focus that he's taking on looking to grow businesses in Ghana, talked to him about our history and where the future potential is. We're working through with the local regulators, getting permits for Subika Underground. I think we're making good progress on that and also making good progress in regards to the mill expansion on the requirements around tailings dam construction. And I think the thing that I've seen in Ghana, which isn't surprising given some of the more broadly publicized issues with tailings dams, there's more focus on the construction. I think we do a good job with that at all of our operations, but we're taking the right time to make sure regulators and other stakeholders are comfortable with what's going on. So, that's taking a little bit more time. I believe we're in a position here in the first half of this year to get those permit approvals in alignment with what's required to take the next steps. The economics look good on both of these projects. We've done really good development work with Subika Underground. So, that sits in a better place to see earlier first production. And then, the mill expansion is a simple expansion, primarily the grinding capacity and crushing capacity at Ahafo. So, there's not new technology or anything going in. So, they're really good additions to the portfolio there.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, mate. We've got a new president in the U.S. Have you met him?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Nope, haven't met him yet, and we're paying attention to what he brings along the way.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Good. Okay. Thanks, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: The next question comes from John Bridges, JPMC. Your line is now open.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Gary, Nancy, Meredith. Congratulations on the results. Just digging a bit deeper into the sulfide project, what's your vision for that? What are you going to be doing in the next couple of years as you study it? What could it be? What could it cost?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think we'll have more information to update the market later this year in terms of some of the details. At a high level, it's looking to – we've been doing the testing of the Yanacocha Verde, the bioleaching of copper. That's showing very promising results. The next phase there is to look at a thiocyanate leach to leach gold from that after we've leached the copper. So, that's the next stage of that testing going on. But so far, that looks good. We continue to do work with the Chaquicocha Underground development. We've had good exploration results. We're looking at a potential to actually extend that decline and do some additional drilling. And that could help and actually provide even a bridge that we haven't talked a lot about, but an incremental that might be able to come out in advance of the overall Yanacocha sulfides projects. But we've got to do a little more drilling on that. The third piece is we would produce a copper gold sulfide concentrate with high arsenic. We've done a lot of metallurgical testing, both with the atmospheric leach process we continue to test with Buenaventura, but also testing the autoclave process. Results there are showing really good recoveries of both copper and gold, so I'm encouraged. That's part of the encouragement I've seen and we've also seen some early results that maybe the capital wouldn't be quite as much as what we thought, but I'm going to hold and wait until later this year to provide an update when we get to the next stage on that project. So, it's really how we take the next stage. We've added several million ounces to resource here, I think 1 point – or about 2 million ounces to the resource base based on this work that we've done and additional drilling we've done. Anything else, John? Did we lose John? Have we lost the line, operator?
Operator: Apparently Mr. John has lost the connection.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay.
Operator: We do have our next question coming from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Gary. Jorge Beristain with DB. My question was circling back on Africa again and just to dig a little bit deeper as to what has actually been the holdup with getting Ahafo and Subika going. We know that there was some tax issues about 18 months ago, but we thought that you had kind of jumped ahead of those versus your peers, settling with the government. And then, we've had recently some tailings – increased tailings risks globally. But could you just comment on what has kind of held up getting the green light so far?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think, Jorge, it really boils down to just working through the permit time – the permits on the underground. With that, it's the impact – what the concern was the impact on the groundwater table when you go down deeper, what is the impact on the surrounding communities. So, we had to work through in our groundwater models and show what the impact is. We think we've got a good handle on that and the regulators I think now believe we've got a good handle on that. So, getting that outlined was probably the big factor in the delay in getting that permit through. And the other point that you make in regards to tailings dams was just getting comfortable around what tailings dam construction method to use at Ahafo for the next stage of expansion. So, we've been working through with the regulators on that. In terms of the tax issues, or more specifically, the investment agreement, we actually negotiated for over two years changes to our investment agreement that allowed for increases in some of the royalty rates. I think it was a good process, from what I've seen there, versus other places in the world, where we worked with government folks and came up with a new agreement and actually had that then ratified by the parliament. So, that's in place and has had approval here. That was just a little bit over a year ago, towards the end of 2015 that that was approved. So, that's in place and gives us the assurances and stability and confidence that we need to go forward with these investments, once we get these permits confirmed.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then, just on South America, I just wanted to check. Your unit costs, particularly for AISC, are not coming down as quickly as what we're seeing in the peers – or in your peer group. And so, the question is, is that because you've had some of the changes to the expected impairments down there and that's kind of taxing your AISC higher than your peers and that's something that you said may be reversible...
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think the key reason – and you're looking at Yanacocha. Let's set Merian aside because I think Merian is performing really well as a new operation, as you would expect from a new operation like that. At Yanacocha, it's more we're coming to the end of the mine life and production declines and some of the inefficiencies you get around that as it declines until we looked for these incremental expansions. We also have a small layback going on there that doesn't get into the higher grade parts of the ore body for another year and a half, two years, so you're seeing some of those costs come through. So, it's not unexpected at this stage in the mine life to see the costs on that operation go up. Operator, I think we lost Jorge as well. Operator, can we go to the next caller?
Operator: The next question comes from Evan Kurtz, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, Gary. I guess, I'll ask one before I fall off. So, the – my question is just on Silverstar. So, if you were to put that back in the numbers, say, in 2018 and 2019, what sort of impact would that have from both a volume aspect and a cost aspect? Well, how costly are those ounces? And what is kind of the likelihood and the cost of actually doing what you need to do to get that mine back in operation and finish off those ounces?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Evan. I'm going to have Tom address that question. It's something that's still under study, but I'll have him cover it.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary, and thanks for the question, Evan. First step for us is to step back and assess the nature of the slip, do some geotechnical drilling to understand how we need to update our structural models and then reassess what would be involved in doing some work on that high wall and removing the slip material then going back in, and we really need to go through that considered process over the, really, the first half or so of this year to make an assessment of what going back in looks like, then I think we're in a position to start to give some information in terms of what impact that would have in the longer term. But for us, at the moment, it's really about just taking that step back and having a considered assessment of what we need to do to get back into that pit.
Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And how many ounces were left in there at this point? Is that something you can flag?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. It's the order of around 200,000 recovered ounces still in that – bottom of that pit. So, we were really right at the end of that mine.
Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then, since I'm still on, maybe I'll ask one more. Is there any update on KCGM?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Nothing to add from our standpoint. I think we continue to operate that mine, and it's doing what we expect it do in terms of operating performance. In terms of the process, we'll watch and we'll see what happens.
Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll hand it over.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, Evan
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton, Imperial Bank of Commerce. Your line is now open.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you for the update. Just a question on Ahafo North, if I may. I see that it's got the green status on your pipeline. Can you just give us an update on what you're thinking there as a standalone project or a satellite to Ahafo, kind of, CapEx, timing, et cetera?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think what we're seeing with Ahafo North, it's probably another three years or so down the road before it comes forward for an investment decision. We're doing more work drilling-wise, doing more work with the community to make sure we've got the right approach there, kind of, leveraging off the good work we've done, I think, both at Ahafo and Akyem community-wise. Initially, there were talks whether we could mine the ore there and haul it down into the Ahafo Mill. It's really looking like the better option would be to have a standalone mill up at Ahafo North to process that ore. And then, we take the loaded carbon, much like we're doing at Long Canyon, where we take the loaded carbon from Long Canyon into Carlin, we take the loaded carbon from Ahafo North down to Ahafo for final processing into doré. So, doing more work there, doing more work on some drilling and, particularly, grade estimation drilling there to make sure we get a good handle like we did with some of our other projects, Merian and Long Canyon, wanting to make sure we've got a good handle on the grade in those first few years. It makes for a little additional cost, but sure helps on the certainty side. So, we're continuing to work through that. In terms of capital, I mean, it's early days. So, I think let's get through and see where we finally land, but I would see it as something probably less than what we spend at Merian, given some of the other infrastructure that's around, but let's wait and see. I think, production-wise, we're probably talking something in the 200,000 million ounce to 250,000 million ounce a year range at this time. So, that gives you some high level.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's excellent. Thank you, Gary. Just looking at Tanami now, reserves have grown once again, exploration seems to be very kind to you, that's a very rich area. Moving on to the expansion beyond now – I know this latest one isn't even delivered yet and I'm talking about the next. Is that contingent upon more exploration, or do you see that there is enough material underground to warrant the next step beyond where we are already?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. From my standpoint, I – we're looking at a variety of different options, whether it's additional declines, a production shaft and different options in how we mine. The resource and reserve continues to grow there, as you pointed out. So, we'll continue to do drilling. We're out of there right now because of the rain and the limits that's had on getting into both of the mine because we don't the fuel to operate the mine. So, we've just gone to standby here for the next – hopefully just next week or so. But I'm encouraged by the potential for this. You will remember, five years ago, we had a project to put in a production shaft, which we put on hold because the mine wasn't performing and delivering the results it needed to. So, we've taken sort of that back off the shelf, clustered it off, but also looked at different places to put it because the ore body has grown quite a bit. And how big you make the shaft, how deep it goes, those are some of the different options that are being looked at here. But for me, I think it's a good next stage. But like you say, we've got to deliver the current expansion. We've got the mining part done, the mill part done here mid-year and make sure we know how that delivers, so we can design what would be an incremental mine expansion and another incremental mill expansion.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: One last question and probably for Nancy. Just very significant cash balance. I know that Newmont has carried quite a bit of cash over the last few years. $2.8 billion thereabout seems like a sizeable balance, and I'm just wondering what your thought process was as to how much to keep and how much to use to retire debt.
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. We have done a lot in this year in terms of retiring our debt, and I think the main focus here is to retain our optionality and have a lot of financial flexibility regardless of what opportunity is in front of us. So, we'll continue to grow the business, invest in our longer-term opportunities and then also stay alert and aware for M&A, as it may present itself.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, you're just keeping your powder dry, basically?
Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.: Exactly.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is now open.
John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC: Thank you for taking my question. I may be a little hazy in my memory. But when Fronteer Gold was promoting Long Canyon, they were looking at a bigger than 1 million ounce deposit that was open, and there had been no indication yet of hitting the sulfides. And the mine plan – and congratulations for pouring gold and making a little profit. Just for a 1-million ounce deposit and the mining rate for ore is something like 6,000 tons a day and weighs to something like 125,000 ton to 175,000 ton a day or 20 to 30 strip. Could you explain a little bit about the depth of the ore, topography constraints, water constraints? It appears that the project definition is more complicated than some of the broad expectations of five years ago.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: John, thanks for the question, and I think a couple of things. We've got about 1.2 million ounces, so we've grown the reserve from where we were when we first announced the project. We continue to do drilling around the deposit and finding – and really haven't closed it off in terms of extensions at depth and down dip, finding higher grades. It goes below the water table at that point. So, how we manage mining below the water table is one of the things we'll be studying as part of Long Canyon Phase 2, the next phase of the project, so we're doing work on that. In terms of current mining rates and strip ratios, you've got a lot higher numbers than what we're actually doing and maybe you've got something tied in when we were doing development and not reflective of what we're seeing more steady state. Strip ratio ranges anywhere between about 8 and 10 here over the next several years. So, higher strip ratio, but also higher grade than average – we get average grades, so that – it's around the ore body average of 1.9 grams per ton.
John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC: Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kit Keane (49:44), S&P Global.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on that – on John's question. If you looked at Long Canyon in terms of the acquisition cost, when would you expect a payback on the projects, how many years would it take?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think, at this stage, it doesn't happen with Phase 1. Clearly, it would be something that would happen out at Phase 3, which would be most likely an underground and a mill complex being installed there in terms of fully paying back the acquisition cost.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Thanks for that. And, yeah, just having recently been on the Barrick call and they mentioned some of their ongoing discussions with potential buyers on Kalgoorlie, is there anything you can add on your view of the asset there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We like the asset. We like operating it, and we're watching the process to see where it comes out.
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. Fair enough. And longer term – or just in terms of M&A, you had mentioned you're obviously always watching the market. Maybe you could – is there anything that you particularly like out there that – any jurisdiction that you particularly like in terms of M&A right now?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think we've got a good footprint around the globe, in areas where we have good operating capabilities and good relations. I think, when you look at what we provided here today in terms of a seven-year outlook and what are our production profile looks like, we can be opportunistic. And as we were with Cripple Creek & Victor at a time when prices were down and people needed the cash and we were able to acquire an asset for good value, we'll always look to see if there's things we can do to improve our portfolio quality in terms of either value or risk. But we've got a really excellent project pipeline that does those things today. We'll continue to probably more focus on early-stage developments, greenfield sort of things or brownfield in areas and in jurisdictions that we're comfortable we can manage well. And so, we'll keep our eyes focused on those sorts of things.
Unknown Speaker: Final question. I appreciate that. In terms of – one of the first questions that was asked about the new administration, obviously, Scott Pruitt was just – he's now the administrator of the EPA and there are some changes expected there. Obviously, it's early days and we can't say for sure what's going to happen at the EPA. But just in terms of Nevada and perhaps in the U.S. in general, do you feel like there will be some benefits in terms of permitting timelines? I'm just kind of looking for a general comment on how you see that changing. For example, if the Waters of the U.S. rule, which obviously isn't enacted fully yet, goes to the wayside, would that benefit you in Nevada? Or just some commentary there.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Thank you for that. I think we're all, kind of, watching the different things coming from the administration. I saw some comments that Mr. Pruitt made yesterday in particular that I liked about having investor certainty. If there's going to be changes to regulations, having a good process for review and understanding of how those properly get implemented is a good thing, I think, for business overall in the U.S. As it affects us directly, I think we already sat in a pretty good spot in terms of how we'd work with regulators. We came up with a sagebrush ecosystem program at the end of last year with the outgoing administration that really helped to address some of the concerns around sage-grouse and other species that are potentially at risk in Nevada and how we would work with the different administrative groups to be able to continue and really not impact our operations. So, I think we sat in a pretty good spot already, but we want to work with the incoming administration. I'm looking to set up a meeting with Mr. Pruitt just to have that sort of discussion around where we have concerns and where we could see logical changes going forward to any process that take into account not just our concerns but all stakeholder concerns going forward and do it in a proper manner.
Unknown Speaker: I'll beg off in just a second, but just can you add to that, what would be the primary concerns for you? What would be the things that you would raise with Mr. Pruitt?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I look at some of the things that had been getting implemented around reclamation bonding, where federal or state jurisdictions already have things in place so we don't have overlap of requirements which is one of the things we come across today. Those are probably a couple of things that I would focus on.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Robert Reynolds, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Good morning, guys. My question is on Merian. You added about 600,000 ounces to reserve there. Is that mostly in the oxide or sulfide? Or can you talk about how that could impact the mine plan?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think it's almost all oxide. We don't really – well, we have sulfide there. It doesn't change the processing method. It's still the leaching process there. I've got our Head of Exploration here, Grigore Simon. He can add to that.
Grigore Simon - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. So, the 600,000 ounces are the Newmont equity ounces that Gary mentioned. They're a combination of ounces coming from the extensions of the pit as well as the success that we had in the lower part of the pit. So, the ounces are a bit of a combination of oxide ounces, of course, the extensions, and in the deeper part of the pit then will be the sulfide ounces.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. And then, in your cost outlook, I think it mentions around 2019 there's higher stripping at Merian. Could you just talk about what your strip ratio is expected to be in 2017 and then what the life of mine strip ratio is at that asset?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. I'm going to hand that one over to Tom Palmer to handle.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. So the strip ratio will be around 3.5 to 4 on average through those years, and that also represents about the life of mine strip ratio as well.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. And then you might have touched on it earlier but at Long Canyon, there is a higher grade resource there. It's about 3.5 gram per tonne out of (56:53) 1.6 million ounces. Is that material that can only be accessed with a Phase 2, or could you mine some of that in Phase 1?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: That would be Phase 2 and looking going below the water table to access that.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Robert.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Barnes, TD Securities. Your line is now open.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Gary, I believe the JV with Barrick at Turquoise Ridge expires this year. What is the plan there?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: No, the JV doesn't expire. We have a processing agreement that we process the ore from Turquoise Ridge at our Twin Creeks mill. And at the end of this year, that's scheduled to be up. So that's what's changing this year there.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: And what is going to happen with the processing agreement?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's something that we'll work out with our joint venture partner.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: And secondly then on CapEx, if you do approve all of the projects this year that you're talking about, would CapEx be up this year and next by $200 million in each year, it's something in that order?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. We'll provide – when we approve those projects, we'll update our development capital. But when you look at just the two projects in Ghana, that's roughly about what the impact would be for additional capital in 2017 and 2018. But we'll provide that update along with the other projects as we approve them.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, Gary. Just quickly, your thoughts on exploration opportunities with much of your near-mine site drilling and what we could look for maybe this time next year.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We continue, obviously, to focus a majority of our spend in the brownfield, so around our existing operations and areas where we've talked about. Greenfields, we're working in places in Eastern Nevada, Western Utah, down in Peru, around the Guiana Shield areas in the northern part of South America, in Ethiopia and also Mount Isa in Queensland in Australia. So – and as we said, upping our spend both on exploration and advanced project spend, really looking not for what we need here in the next three to five years, but looking at the next five to 10 years what's important for the business.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And just following up on your thoughts on the EPA and such. Geologics aside, does the U.S. may become a better, more attractive place to mine for over the next four to six, seven years given what changes could possibly occur?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think we still look long term for all these sorts of things when there's different administrations, whether it's here or in other countries and still look to invest where it makes sense for the long term.
Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC: As long as they don't change the mining law, I guess that will be helpful. Thanks, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaip, BMO.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi, Gary, Nancy and Tom. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I've got a couple. One, the sustaining capital, you made a remark that sustaining capital had come down in 2017 timeframe because of savings as well as deferrals. And I'm just wondering if you can expand a bit on those two items. What were the drivers of those changes?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. I'm going to have Tom Palmer cover that.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: I'll give you maybe two examples, Andrew. In terms of savings, a lot of our sustaining capital goes into tailings facilities. At say for instance Boddington, which is a very large operation, low-grade mine, obviously we generate a lot of tailings, we've got better contract rates for building our tailings extensions. So you get savings by building some of those, still constructing the same amount of tailings, but you're getting them at a cheaper rate. So starting to build some of that into our plans going forward. And then there are other things we do. Another example would be Cripple Creek & Victor where we have optimized our mine plans, and some of the equipment that we thought we needed to buy, we can now defer into future years. So, that's an example of deferrals that are reflecting in our sustaining capital going forward.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thanks. That provides a better understanding. And within that, there's really no – I mean, is there a component of deferral of stripping programs, that CapEx is inevitably going to have to show up in later years or was it mostly restricted to equipment and improved contracting rates and improved cost?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: As you say, Andrew, it's more about the latter. It's improved rates, improved unit costs, deferral where we have done mine and plan optimization. And as we talked about today, we are – got some maturing operations and we are moving into those stripping campaigns and talking about it. So, we continue to do those campaigns for the longer term. So, we're not pushing any of that stuff out.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thanks very much. At Long Canyon, it strikes me that the grade – I mean, grade from a heap leach perspective is already very attractive. And I'm just wondering, as you move towards permitting below the water table, is the move to – and you're looking at the prospects of higher grade resources to convert to reserves. Is the move in Phase 2 really towards permitting a milling complex sooner rather than later?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. What we need to do is get the reserve and resource figured out, the elements of the water and how we're going to manage it so that we can put together our overall permit requirements for both the mill and expansion of the leach. We haven't firmed up, but it automatically goes to a mill. I think economics may drive it that way, but we need to do the study work on it. So, at this stage, because we've got Phase 1 in place, we want to be very methodical in our review and make sure we bring the permit along at the right time in the process.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Great. And then, just finally, on another exploration project, Sabajo, and now that you're operating in Suriname, I'm just wondering – and you're looking at acquiring additional ground at Sabajo. Is there an update that you can provide on those activities?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Sabajo is actually – it's about 40 kilometers west of Merian and the way, at least, we're assessing it today is as a satellite ore body that could feed ore to the mill at Merian. It provides some additional saprolite ore that we could truck over. So, we're setting options on how we could truck it and when the right timeframe is for that. It's probably not going to add to Merian until the 2020-2021 timeframe based on what we know today, but it's still early days. We're just moving that project in our project pipeline along to the next stage. So, it's still early days to know the details on it.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Our final question comes from Tanya Jakusconek, Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple. The first one, Gary, can we back to the reserves and resources and can you talk a little bit about the 2.6 million ounces that got reclassified into resources from reserves and what caused those to move and what assets are they exactly?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. I can do that. Thanks, Tanya. I think, one of them – and when you look at our reserve-resource release, you can see there were price changes that affected the reserves by about 600,000 ounces, there was primarily a change in the capital price assumption at Phoenix that moved around 500,000 ounces from reserve to resource, so that's what we'd call our reclassification, so that added about 500,000 ounces of that 2.6 million ounces. We had changes to Carlin due to updated pit designs. They'll show in revisions on the reserves side and that adds to the reclassified, the 2.6 million ounces. You see a very small number for revisions because that's a net number, and it nets out additions that we see for other reasons that Carlin and Ahafo North against some of the revisions to the Carlin pit design and also a Boddington, where we've updated the requirements to support the tailings facility expansion and moved about 600,000 ounces from reserve to resource. So, that gives you about – well, it's the majority of what that 2.6 million ounces and reclassification is for those three. The others were just technical updates, as we revised some requirements for drill spacing in different areas.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: I had 0.6 million ounces for Boddington and I had 0.5 million ounces for Carlin. I didn't have a number for Ahafo North. Was that in the 0.5 million ounces to 0.6 million ounces also?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. Carlin was 0.7 million ounces, Boddington 0.6 million ounces and Phoenix 0.5 million ounces of that reclassification. Ahafo North was plus 0.5 million ounces.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Okay.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: And there was another Carlin plus – I think it's about 0.6 million ounces...
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Okay.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's offsetting in the reserve side.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my second question is on Twin Creeks, the underground project. Can you just remind us of the – given that this one is going to be – you're making a decision on a second half of this year or mid-year, can you remind us the operational parameters, CapEx, cost, et cetera on this asset?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: What I'd say, this is like what we've done at Carlin, where we came to the end of an open pit and then do a decline basically down into the reserve next to or adjacent to and below the open pit. It's small in terms of its overall contribution. We'll update the market once we get that, but it's not big in terms of cost or in ounces. But it does add an increment at Twin Creeks.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Any sort of sizes at under 50,000 ounces a year? Or, like, do we have any idea of size just to have it as a perspective?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure thing. Tom?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. It's 40,000 to 50,000 ounces at that sort of range...
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: And how – yeah, okay. And the capital would just be a decline to get to it. Would that be a safe thing to model?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, I think that sounds all right.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. And we've done the early study work there. We've actually installed the decline. And so, we've got access to the ore body in place. So, it actually would be a pretty short timeframe there, but it's small.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: It's small? Okay. And then, maybe just the last question on Boddington, Twin Creeks again and I think you mentioned Carlin, too. I think it was said that the production will be declining over the next couple of years and then coming back up again. When you say coming back up again, are we coming back to what sort of level? Is it back to 2016 levels or...
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: We'll run through – start with Boddington. I'll have Tom go through.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Boddington returns back – in 2019, you can expect to return back to 2016 levels.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: And Carlin?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah, Carlin will return to similar levels again.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: And the same thing, Twin won't come up quite as much.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: No, Twin won't come up as much.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: Okay.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: And Ahafo comes up a lot more, as we get into the much higher grade at the bottom of the next pushback in 2019.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital: That was more because of grade. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Great. Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary for closing remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. Our team delivered exceptional performance, portfolio improvements and value last year. This year, we'll build on that trajectory by delivering steady gold production at competitive costs and continuing to improve those costs through our Full Potential program. We'll also continue to invest in profitable growth by completing the Tanami expansion in Australia, by reaching decisions to fund expansions at Ahafo, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha that represent upside to our current guidance and by pursuing early-stage and exploration opportunities to build our reserve base. Finally, we'll maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and the leading talent, governance and sustainability practices that underpin long-term value creation. Thank you for joining us, and have a safe day.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now all disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over now to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Newmont's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining us today are Gary Goldberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, our Chief Operating Officer. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news. First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly-traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues. Prior to that, she was CFO from MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly-traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure. I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating. The second news update, I'm pleased to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017, through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender. Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results. Turning to slide 2, please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on slide 3. We continue to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior-year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining costs at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year, but still in line with our 2016 guidance, and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget, and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour gold next month or about two months ahead of schedule. We also continue to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior-year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and, most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability. Turning to slide 4, sending people home safely everyday is a matter of principle, and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the Mining Sector's Top Performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in the row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for five consecutive months without an injury, which is an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition. Turning to slide 5, for more on that transition, we poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget, as well as our successful exploration program. Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple of hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine. Turning to Long Canyon on slide 6, construction is nearly complete and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We're confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold prize is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit, and mineralization remains open in all directions. Moving to the full portfolio on slide 7, even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 22% since 2012. Nearly two-thirds of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs were slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook. Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek & Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM, and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo. Year-to-date, all-in sustaining costs of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 per ounce and $930 per ounce. During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital, and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. We look forward to sharing our refreshed five-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance, and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects, and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth. Turning to slide 8, we positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund five projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining costs of less than $700 per ounce over the next two years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%. I'll turn now to slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction, and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB's stake in PTNNT, a valid export license at closing, the current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events. With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last three years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold. Now, before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale. And as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operations. Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release. As we had indicated would happen, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So, with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide. GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million non-cash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operations and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13. Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from re-leaching pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior-year quarter. Now, turning to slide 11, for a look at our third quarter financial performance, increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost tripled compared to the prior year and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million. Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx. Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth. And yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities. This morning, we announced the $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With the total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable. Turning to net debt, we continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1 time at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1 times is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded given the accounting treatment. We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense. So, we focus on a balance of the two efforts. Now, I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter, in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017. The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase. In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior-year quarter dividend. The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date and how we apply them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to-date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And repay debt, we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And returning cash to shareholders, as I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles. With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Laurie. We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian, producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek & Victor, Carlin, and Boddington more than offset decline in production at Yanacocha; and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects. Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory draw-downs in Africa; and some operational changes, including low-grade, deep transitional ores at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin's surface mines. Turning to our regional performance on slide 16, as Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added cyanide to the leach pad last week and we shipped carbon to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies to pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway. We've completed the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case. Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the Northwest. Work to install arrays and some ventilation equipment is underway. And this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip at the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North area will impact fourth quarter product. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and had evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year. So, there is no impact to longer-term production or costs. We're making good progress at Leeville underground, where we fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof bolts designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business. Turning to South America on slide 17, Gary and I were in Suriname two weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha through the potential development of Cocha main (18:47) to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have three drill rigs operating in the Chaquicocha decline and are testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver. Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plant for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results. Turning to Australia on slide 18, we started full potential in Australia nearly four years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter, and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May. At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering, procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine of Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017. Finally, turning to Africa on slide 19, Akyem and Ahafo continue to deliver solid performance, achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries, and Africa remains our lowest region for injuries. Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls. With that, I'll return the call to Gary on slide 20.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a timeframe for delivering projects into production, all the way out to our greenfield exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier-stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground mine in Ghana. Turning to slide 21. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs, would also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles. The Subika Underground mine will produce ore grades that are three times higher than the current surface mine grades, and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 ounces and 300,000 ounces of gold annually with first production in 2018, and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration. Turning to slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists. Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013; at Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010; at Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003, and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries; and finally, at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable. Turning to our market outlook on slide 23, low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals. On the supply side, three-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the two countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs our strategy remains the same. Turning to slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last three-and-a-half years and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. Though we're not relying on rising gold prices or resting on our achievements, our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business. And you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders. Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question on the queue comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may begin.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Morning, Gary, Laurie and team. First off, Laurie, thank you very much for your help over the last few years. It's been excellent working with you, and all the best for the future and in retirement. I've a question on – my first question is on Ahafo. Obviously, we saw a jump in cash cost and, obviously, the all-in sustaining cash cost. What drove that? I know you said there's inventory or negative inventory adjustment. Can you guys just elaborate and what you expect going forward at that operation?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks for your comments. At Ahafo, we're into a point where we're going to start to draw down on the stockpile. From a cash flow standpoint, that's a very positive because we have less tied up on the balance sheet. But those are generally going to be higher cost ounces than what we're mining today. So, you'll see a bit of a negative P&L impact on it, but we're also focused on (26:40) cash. So, it's a positive on the cash side.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Is that something that goes on for a couple of quarters or is that like an annual thing?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think you're going to see that going into next year; that will come through in full detail with the 2017 guidance. But as we wait for the Ahafo Mill and Subika Underground, I think you're going to see that continue for a bit.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. I mean – I'm sorry, the next question is on Merian. Now, you guys obviously – you're up to commercial production. Can you guys just discuss what the upside is there sort of on a longer-term view, sort of three or five-year view on – and specially with something like how much exploration spend you guys are going to allocate to this site?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think a couple of things, Andrew. First of all, I think there's potential upside in mill throughput. As we get things ramped up, we'll have a better idea on what the actual potential of the mill is, but we see that as a potential upside. We're not building that in, in our current guidance as we look into 2017, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results. Whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit, the results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which – with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up – I don't think we've got it in this slide pack. But in the last quarter slides, we had some cross sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit. So, I'm very encouraged there, and we continue to look. Sabajo is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore. So, it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So, overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of David Haughton of CIBC. Your line is open. You may begin.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and Tom, and good luck for the future, Laurie. I've got a question on Merian. So, early days, I know, but you've been mining there for a while. I was just wondering how the ore is behaving. Is it reconciling to your block model expectations? Is it going through the mill as expected? The slide that you'd shown as a backdrop there of the stockpile looked like it was really soft ore. So, I wonder if you could just talk to some of those items, please.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. I think in terms of reconciliation, we're probably reconciling with a bit higher tonnes than what was expected. And that's not unusual as you're at the upper parts of the ore body, on the fringes to have found that. But as we get in, grade is reconciling very close to what we expected. As you may recall, when we announced the project, I talked about the fact we did an additional roughly $25 million worth of drilling to understand that ore body. So, I'm not surprised that it's coming in, but that's coming in well. I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and the backhoe to help feed into the mill, and that process is going well. I think early on here, for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter – actually, you're right, at the surface, where you've got roots and things from plant materials. So, some of that's come through. But I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing they've had to manage with, that I wouldn't say was a surprise, but just it adds some complexity to the startup. But I think the startup and ramp-up's been going very well and all according to plan.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Excellent. Just switching over to Long Canyon coming on stream by year-end it looks like. I'm wondering if at this stage you could give us an idea how the CapEx is going. So, ahead of time, is it looking like it's within your budget or better?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. I think, at this stage, Long Canyon, we haven't updated. I'd like to get it up to the commercial production point, and then at that point, we'll update our guidance on the capital. But it's going very well.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from Andrew Kaip of BMO. Your line is open. You may begin.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi, Gary and Laurie. Congratulations on a good quarter. David hit the, or got to, my questions first on Long Canyon and just the CapEx. I'm wondering how you're tracking in that regard.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Okay. Well, I think the same as what we just told David, we're tracking – we'll give an update when we achieve first commercial production, but we're tracking very well against what we expected.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Tanya Jakusconek of Scotia Bank. Your line is open. You may begin.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Great. Good morning, everybody. And Laurie, congratulations on your future board work. Questions on – some technical questions, if I may. Just coming to Merian, Gary, seeing things have started off well, why then the 20,000 ounces downward revision to guidance for that asset for this year? I mean, I know I'm splitting hair, but maybe there's something with the plants or the routes that had to make adjustments. I'm just trying to understand what changed your guidance.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: I'm going to hand over for Tom to give an update on that one.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, Tanya. We commissioned the facility exactly as we planned to this year. What we'd assumed in our plan which goes to those 20,000 ounces is we thought as we're building gold inventory in circuit that before we declared commercial production, we would pull off around 20,000 ounces. As it turned out, commissioning went very smoothly, but we didn't drop first ounces out of the circuit until essentially the 1st of October. So, just the way the commissioning went, that 20,000 ounces didn't present in the pre-commissioning, so we started first gold from the 1st of October. So, a slight offset as we move into the remaining part of this year, around the 100,000 ounces rather than the 120,000 ounces.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: It's really a matching production to sales piece...
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): To sales, okay.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: ...because of the sales timing.
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. There's gold in the circuit.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Okay. No, that's fine. I just wanted to know, because it didn't seem with everything else, your tonnage on your grade on the block models seemed to be reconciling. So, I was just trying to understand what happened. Okay. So, that's helpful. And maybe if I can continue still on the technical side, just on the geotechnical issues in Nevada, I know it's something that you mentioned for Q4, we'll see a bit weaker. What is weaker? What will we lose from these geotechnical issues?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: You'll see our guidance for Carlin for production, we're dropping from, I think, a range of 1,040 ounces to 1,100 ounces down to 970 ounces to 1,030 ounces. So, that's the impact of those geotechnical issues. With the slip at Silverstar, we're monitoring that. We're right near the end of mining that pit. We understood that fault. We're monitoring that area. We'd stepped out to just add a bit of protection and then the slip slowly came down. As I said in my notes, we had people and equipment well clear of that area. So, that's the main driver of the impact on the revised production guidance for Carlin for this year. Some of those ounces will push into 2017, so we were expected to be out of that mine at the end of this year. As a result of this issue, we push into the first part of the first quarter and some of those ounces will move across into next year.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): What do you think would move across? Is it half of them or what would be a guesstimate?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think half would be a reasonable estimate.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe just on Boddington, obviously, a great throughput in the quarter. Maybe just what's happening there, at that operation?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: I think what you're seeing at Boddington, four years of full potential work, excellent leadership from Alex Bates and the team there at Boddington. That mill is really hitting its straps. All the work we've done over several years, that team is driving that mill to record performance. We've had record months. We've had record weeks. And it's really the fruition of a lot of hard work to improve the availability and the reliability of that facility down at Boddington.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): And you think that's sustainable?
Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yes. Yeah. This is the result of a lot of a hard work, a very capable leadership team, and I fully expect that performance to continue and to look to improve.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Well, that's good. And maybe one for you, Gary. I know we talked about Batu Hijau, hopefully, the completion of the sale very soon. And I was writing viciously some of the things that are still left to outstanding. Can you just review again what exactly are we waiting for to just complete this? Like, what have we done and what are we waiting for? Sorry, I just missed that. Yeah.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Yeah. The number of the conditions precedent have been met in terms of different approval of the buyer shareholders, for instance, the resolution of certain tax issues and government approvals. And I was over there last month with Randy. We had an opportunity to meet with the team on the ground in Batu Hijau and in Jakarta to thank them for all their work through the transition and all the work they've done, especially through some of the challenging last three years as we've had to work through the changed approach to getting export permits. Also, I had the opportunity to meet with government officials in that process as well to thank them for their support. In terms of the key outstanding item remaining is actually getting the concurrent sale or the sale of one of the partners. Basically, the Bakrie's MDB, and having that sale go through. There's elements of that we're not in control of, it's stuff that they need to work through as they go through that process as that comes to a conclusion. That's really the key main item that's left outstanding.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, the rest of the other ones you've mentioned you pretty much have that in place. Obviously, the export permit you said that sometime in November it expires and you're looking to have that one renewed.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: That's correct. We've submitted our application there.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. We look forward to closing it and getting the monies. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: So do we. Thank you, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ma'am. The next question on queue coming from the line of Anita Soni of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may begin.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: That's okay. Tanya asked this question, which was with regards to the production at Merian, so I will take it offline now. Thanks.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Anita. I know you guys have a busy day today with lots of earnings coming out.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Indeed. Thanks.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. The next question on the queue coming from the line of Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may begin.
Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi, guys. Yeah. Two questions from me. Just on slide 20 where you've got the project pipeline laid out. In terms of the pre-feasibility study projects in the middle, can you just give a quick rundown on the timing that we should expect for some of those projects, please?
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Sure. I'll run through. They all vary, as you can imagine, based on their complexity. Yanacocha sulfides at the top is about a two-year process to work that through pre-feas and on into definitive feasibility. Awonsu and Apensu Deeps are really underground extensions around Ahafo. And that's really primarily a combination of drilling and how things work. That's probably a more of the two to three years sort of a timeframe. Ahafo North is more in the three-year timeframe as we work through the next stages for that project. Tanami Expansion 2, I would see in that same sort of two- to three-year timeframe. So that – well, three – it says below three to five years at the bottom. And then, Federation, the same thing. It's really getting the expansion – Tanami Expansion 2, by the way, is a shaft, is what we're looking at for production there because the deposit extends so much at depth. So, hopefully, it gives you an idea. And that was the idea of putting the years at the bottom. Three to five is a general kind of a rule, but they all vary a little bit around there.
Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Thanks. Thanks, Gary. I was just wondering whether we should expect any of those a bit sooner. And then, just a question to Laurie on Batu closing. I'm sorry if you've been through this before, but the $920 million gross proceeds, can you just give an update on how the amount that you'll actually receive to Newmont post closeout of any internal debt in Indonesia actually flows through to you and how that might vary depending on the exact closure date of the deal?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.: The debt is all paid off, so there's no debt coming. That's something that we handled already. So, that will not affect it. There are some deposits that the buyers already made. So, that has an impact on it. And then, we'll also – well, from an accounting standpoint, we'll note any cost of it. But for the most part, you're going to get most of that money just coming directly through the $875 million that was on the slide is what we expect to come through.
Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks, Laurie.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And at this time, we have no question on queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Gary Goldberg.
Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.: Thank you, and thank you all for joining the call this morning. I know you've got lots of activity going on in the space. The Newmont team delivered another strong quarter and our work to raise our performance to the next level continues. We're also pleased to share good news, which includes appointing experienced finance leader, Nancy Buese, to the role of Executive Vice President and CFO, effective October 31; announcing higher dividends in the fourth quarter and an enhanced dividend policy for 2017, and a $500 million debt tender; delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. Thank you again for your time and have a safe day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. And I'd like to turn the call over now to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide two, before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here or you can refer to our SEC filings found on our website, newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide three.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding five high margin projects, and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash to shareholders. Turning to specifics on slide four, comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining costs by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces. Portfolio improvements for the quarter include: announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami on time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price linked dividend. Strong performance starts at our operations. Turning to slide five, we've lowered our total injury rates by 54% since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix, who recently reached a milestone of three years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor, who just reached four months working without injuries, our operation's best safety performance to-date. Safety and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries per 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. At the same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new valley leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule. Turning to slide six for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining costs down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced costs by 28% since 2012. Nearly two-thirds of these savings are the result of higher production at lower cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our costs also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses. Turning to production on slide seven, second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%, improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami, and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores. In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming on line at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full-year 2016 gold guidance giving stronger production from the rest of the portfolio. I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on slide eight. Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development along. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent. The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, it strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about three quarters of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self-fund our best projects. Turning to our current projects on slide nine, Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter. And we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support an improved internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range. On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the current pit and elsewhere in the concession. Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about two months ahead of schedule. The project remained on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017. Q2 exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high teens. Moving from the new mines to expansions, the CC&V expansion includes a new mill and leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Plan modifications are complete and throughput continues to improve. The valley leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. And the recovery plant will be complete by the year-end. The Tanami expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April, three months ahead of schedule and mill demolition is complete and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid 30% range. Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. These four projects: Merian, Long Canyon and the two expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining costs of around $700 per ounce over the next two years. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for financial results.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I'd like to start with income turning to slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior-year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is a $0.34 per share non-cash tax valuation allowance. I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we have the opportunity to carry back losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we would use them soon. The transaction, overall, resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million. Turning to slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance, strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year. Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with, notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru. Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior-year quarter, and gold all-in sustaining costs have improved $33 per ounce; both benefiting from the higher volumes and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar. As Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up, and especially Merian coming on line. Turning to slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio. During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the $83 million I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable. We maintained our gold price linked dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold price is maintained, our gold price linked dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance. Now turning to our capital priorities on slide 15; on this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V. And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest. Turning to slide 16, we ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds less the cash held at PTNNT, for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality. And as you can see, ending up here with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation. Turning to slide 17. Strong organic performance, assisted by fair value asset sales, has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt to EBITDA of 1-time is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1-times net debt to EBITDA at $1,200 gold. As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date and we continue to expect debt repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt on our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction. Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our three-year cumulative free cash flow leads the industry, allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invest this cash in our highest return projects resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed. In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Laurie. Turning to slide 20, this slide shows our all-in sustaining costs guidance excluding Batu Hijau. We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve costs by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future. Turning to production guidance on slide 21, we expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million ounces and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction. In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting that Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017, when Phase 6 ore production winds down. Turning to capital on slide 22, our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital of between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects. Turning to our pipeline on slide 23, I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Quecher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these two projects in 2017. Estudio Integral is moving to prefeasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results. Turning to more details, Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900-feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin north area, sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine while leveraging existing infrastructure. The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by seven years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining costs by an average of $25 per ounce during the first five years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly perspective district. Turning to Africa on slide 25, the Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika Underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground mine in the second half of 2016. Turning to South America on slide 26, we've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of Estudio Integral, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to-date, we're pursuing development of Quecher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019. Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with prefeasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold, copper, sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Prefeasibility studies are expected to take two years, and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed. Turning to our market outlook on slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or at most one rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends. Turning to slide 28. As I mentioned, depressed interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer-dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same. And I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycles, on slide 29. We built a solid foundation over the last three years and we continue to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016, but we're not relying on rising gold price or resting on our laurels. Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business. And you can count on us to continue delivering safer and more efficient operations, a portfolio of longer life lower cost assets, an exceptional project pipeline and exploration record and a stronger balance sheet. Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn it over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And for our first question, it's from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thanks very much for the update. Congratulations again on a very strong quarter. Just a couple of questions. First with the Tanami, obviously, a very good quarter there. Can you give some sort of guidance on the grade going forward there at Tanami?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Give me a second to look that one up. I'm not across the details on that one.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: (25:33)
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If there's another question while I (25:34) look that one up.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. I suppose the other one is, the two projects in Ghana, although it's pretty much at one, the Ahafo Mill Expansion is the big (25:43), you've got the -infrastructure is there. Is there something holding that up, any sort of permits or anything holding that sort of approval up, Gary?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think, we're going through the normal process of community consultation and working with the regulatory authorities there, the EPA, to work through that permit approval process.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And we've continued to optimize that as we signed additional work and that's part of just our normal process of making sure we layer in the cash flows and the work appropriately.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And do you think that will be something we hear about in the second half of 2016?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Absolutely, yes.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Good. Before that Tanami one, you've seen one of your peers actually explore or actually conduct some producer hedging. I'm just wondering if I get your comment on that, Gary. Sorry, Laurie, what that would mean to Newmont, are you guys looking anything like that on the currency side or even on the commodity side?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. We've done a bit of currency hedging, but certainly on the commodity side, we feel that our balance sheet is strong enough to manage where we're at and we want to make sure that that upside all accrues to our investors.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And to be clear, the last of that currency hedging we basically unwound and we're letting the rest of that runoff here, which will happen by the end of, well, maybe the next year.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We monitor the market, but haven't added any currency hedges in a couple years.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And back to your Tanami question, really no major change in grade expected here going forward. I think what you've seen in that range is consistent with what we expect going forward.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Okay. So, for our next question is from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Line is open, sir.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, John? Operator, we're not hearing John.
Operator: Just a second please, sir. Your line is open Mr. Bridges.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you hear me now?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Now we've got you, John, thank you.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Wonders of modern technology. Congratulations again on your results and the beat. The project Integral, the Chaquicocha thing is, is that it or are there other things prior to these prefease that you're talking about? Because that's going to leave the project quite light on production. Are there other things that you're looking at in the shorter term?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of what we expect for production, we had initially expected end of production in 2019. What this does is, extends this out at about 200,000 ounce a year rate through 2024. Pending the results of the prefeasibility study on the work on the gold, copper, sulfides, we could see production as early as 2022, but we've got to go through those studies to really confirm it. In terms of other areas of production, I don't see anything that I would introduce at this stage based on what we're looking at.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then the African projects, Ahafo Mill and Subika, is it just you getting comfortable with the gold price that supports that and generates a decent return, or are there still a few things that you're looking at before you make a decision?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Really a combination of getting engineering work done, and having that getting the permits to a point where we're comfortable that we can proceed and then bringing it forward for final approval.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. I'll get back in the line. But many, many thanks and congrats.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: And for our next question, it's from Mr. Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Line is open, sir.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Gary and Laurie, and again congrats to you and your team on strong results. I guess, my question is just a few on the Quecher Main project, how should we think about that in relation to the overall Yanacocha production profile over the next few years? When you say that it's sustaining production at 200,000 ounces, do you mean that's incremental production or that allows you just to sustain the totality of Yanacocha at 200,000 ounces? That's my first question.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The latter is correct. The totality would be at 200,000 ounces from – on an average, from 2019 going forward through 2024.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. I probably just invented a word there. The other question I had was on Conga. Anything you can fill us in on the latest kind of political sentiment in Peru toward that, and could you see reigniting Conga any time sort of before 2020?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. We basically have put Conga on the shelf for now, pending, seeing a significant change in the local support for that project. I do think that election changes there are a positive sign in terms of what we've heard the President say about the potential to see development and work more closely with local communities and seeing that development. But for the time being, I don't see us in the current price environment, in the current social climate moving that project forward before 2020.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And if I could just squeeze one last one in, with the sale of Batu, obviously, your complexion and exposure to copper is diminishing. How should we think about your balance sheet now with all of the additional cash? If you were to sort of put your marginal chips down on metals on a go-forward basis, could you see re-upping your copper exposure or are you kind of sending the message now that you're very happy to stay mostly golden? Just trying to understand what your thinking is.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Good question. I think where we are with our two copper gold producers still in Phoenix and Boddington, so, we still have a place in the copper concentrate market and in producing copper cathodes at Phoenix. When you look at our greenfield exploration, we are really about half of that greenfield exploration is focused on copper gold areas. So, we're not going away or moving away from copper gold, but clearly, our expertise and when you look at our pipeline, I think the next project in there that really is a copper gold project is Estudio Integral, the great copper, gold sulfide resource there that we need to figure out how to be able to bring on in an economic way. So, we're not really moving away from copper, but clearly our production is going to be very gold-centric here going forward.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Garrett Nelson from BB&T Capital Markets. Line is open.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. Congrats on another great release. On a sequential basis, it looks like what really drove the strong results on the costs side was CC&V. Your CAS was down. It looks like a little over $90 an ounce and production basically doubled from Q1. In addition to the benefit of first production from the leach pad there in March, can you talk about some of the other things you've done there since acquiring it last summer to drive down the mine's cost and improve operating performance?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It's a good question. And when we acquired CC&V, we indicated that we expected to be able to reduce mining costs by about 10%. And the team there has done a really good job. Things like our contract for tire purchases is an example, as a detail in terms of being able to acquire tires for quite a bit lower than what they were acquiring the tires for before we got involved. I think we continue to look at different ways to improve efficiency. And we've seen that. You're spot on. We did see the higher production in the second quarter as we got first production out of the new leach facility there. So that helped the divisor and helped the overall costs. I think as we go through our plans and preparations here to look through our 2017 budgets, I'll be looking to see where we can get more than just the 10% in terms of mining cost improvements. I'm looking at our COO next door to me here.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And then what's your best guess right now for when you expect Batu Hijau sale to close? Can you get any more specific just for modeling purposes?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think when you look at the different closing – pre-close requirements, we're still looking at a 60-day to 90-day window at this stage. So, I think the best we can give at this stage. We are progressing, working with the buyer and working with the various government approvals that we need to get and the other stages that are in there. So, it's all moving forward, but we do need, fairly complex transaction and need to work through all the different details.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: Great. Thanks very much, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Garrett.
Operator: Thank you. And for our next question, it's from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is open.
John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. Two if I could, Gary. First, could you just review the change in the long-term crude oil price assumption in a little more detail and what the price might be by year. And second, now that the Indonesian theater is out of the picture, how do you think you and the team will reallocate focus? Will the extra time be spent on Yanacocha oxides or copper sulfides or Conga or Merian or preventing malaria in Ghana? What's the next battle you're going to fight with all that time freed up?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, in regards to helping with malaria in Ghana, I think we actually have made some really good strides on that one already. It's a good thing we've got good folks on the team who know how to help with those things. First of all, on your oil price question, we've taken our long-term oil price assumption from $65 a barrel to $50 a barrel in those assumptions. So, we'll continue to keep an eye on that, but that's the change you see reflected, in part, along with the Northwest Exodus and the changes to our longer term cost outlook that we provided in guidance. In terms of focus, clearly, we're focused now on making sure we get a successful transition. As I've said, our Batu Hijau is a great mine with great employees, want to make sure we give a good handover of the operation to the buyers. So, a lot of focus on that here over the next three months. And we've got four, now five, with Northwest Exodus projects that are going through in some cases their final stage; Merian bringing that online successfully is a big focus; Long Canyon, early next year; Tanami getting that through; and the rest at CC&V; and then of course, Northwest Exodus. So, I want to make sure the team's focused on continuing to bring those projects online, on budget or below and on schedule or sooner than schedule. So, that's really the big focus. I think exploration wise, we continue to see that as a core competency with the team here and our ability to add to existing operations and the work we're doing in the greenfield areas that we've shown on some prior slides in the past in terms of exploration in different areas around the world continues to be a focus for us.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The only thing I'd add to that would be projects in Ghana. Assuming we continue to bring those forward in the back half of the year, that will be quite a few projects that we will have up and running in our process at the same time. So, that'll be a big focus.
John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC: Thank you, and congratulations.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Line is open.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thanks for the update, and congratulations on the results. My question is just regards to the dividend policy. So, Laurie, you mentioned that it would double if the gold price remains the same. But could you give us some perimeters around what kind of percentage in free cash flow payout ratio that you're looking at? I think you've talked on the call with the divesture of Batu Hijau about revisiting that grid itself because of cost reductions and ability to generate free cash flow.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll start off with that, Anita. I think what we targeted when we put the current gold price linked dividend payout schedule together and that was about a year-and-a-half, almost two years ago now, was based on the way we saw our production and cash flow out over the next several years tied in with our need to continue to pay down debt and invest in projects. And that was based on about a 20% to 25% of our free cash flow paid back out in the dividend. As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount. And we're going to look at that. We review our plans for the next five years at the board meeting in October, our 2017 plan as we call it. And as part of that, we'll review whether we want to change that payout percentage, once again looking at what the cash needs will be for debt reduction, for investment in projects and also for returns to shareholders. So that's the process that we'll be going through here in the next three months.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And the only thing I would add is that when we did adjust the dividend the last time we said, we had to make a real priority on debt pay down. And we've made so much progress as Gary said that we feel comfortable that we could probably make less of a priority on that as particular aspect going forward.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. So, you revisited with the board meeting in October and that would be to address 2017 dividends?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. And second question is with regards to CC&V, just on from an operational standpoint, I think you had previously said that it would be back-end weighted to the second half of the year and you posted a very strong second quarter. If that kind of run rate continues for Q3 and Q4, you would probably be pushing the top end of your guidance range even just on throughput, even if the grade dropped again. So, I'm just wondering what the rationale right now is for not guiding upwards on CC&V at this point?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I want to make sure that they get the recovery facility bedded down good and operating well there. Right now, we're taking the carbon over to process over at the original leach facility. That needs to come online. So, just, it's more a matter of being cautious to make sure we get the rest of the project finish before we modify that production guidance.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: All right. Thank you very much. Congrats again.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Anita.
Operator: Thank you. And for our next question, it's from David Haughton of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Line is open.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thank you for hosting the call. Gary, you pointed out that in 2017 that the sustaining CapEx is going to take a step up with the number of projects that you've got on the slide deck. Can you give us an idea whereabouts those projects will be, a little bit of an idea as to which mines we should be attributing that higher sustaining CapEx to?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The water treatment you'd see some of that in Ghana, I think a little bit more in Peru quite frankly in terms of where those are, tailings facilities, Ghana as well. And I'm trying – we'll give obviously more detail on it when we do our guidance here and present that later this year for the future five years.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, it's not universally spread around. It's just a couple of key projects that you've got to undertake in 2017. So, it's not just a widespread lift.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Exactly.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just I think now you were talking about Ghana, I presume that for the go ahead for Ahafo and Subika, are these the kind of projects that you're also looking at higher than 15% IRR at $1,200? Is that the kind of hurdle that you would have in mind to give it a green light?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I definitely see both of those projects standalone being able to achieve that type of a hurdle rate. And then, there's synergy value of doing them both together. So, we'll give more details on that at the time that we would approve the project and announce it to the market.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, oh, we're really waiting on here is just due process of board consideration, allocation of capital. It seems to have ticked a lot of boxes from the permitting and the social license point of view and the IRRs, is just a matter of process now. Is that a reasonable way to assess it?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would be a good way to look at it.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Northwest Exodus, would you be reporting that separately or would it just sort of be part of the Carlin underground feed that we currently see in your quarterly reporting?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It would be part of the Carlin underground feed that you see. And this year, we had about 5,000 ounces. And just to talk about it, we've got a ventilation raise and then the fans to put in which would occur by the end of the first half of next year and then further development, really it's into 2018 before you see Exodus up to full production. Getting that ventilation raise and also helps gives us air so we can get out further towards the Northwest beyond what you saw in the one slide to the right and access more areas for exploration.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Andrew Kaip from BMO. Line is open.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi. Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Congratulations on the quarter. Look, I've got a couple of questions. One, Laurie for you, you've been quite successful at looking at taking loss carries back and benefiting from application. I'm just wondering are we going to see more of that opportunity arise or are the last two quarters something that was just a benefit of that you've been able to realize?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. A lot of times you see that type of thing in the first half of the year as you file your tax return for the previous year. So, the team will continue to focus on that, and I do think our tax team does a great job of focusing on cash. Sometimes you see this volatility in the P&L, but we've got them focused on cash, which I think is most important. You'll probably continue to see the volatility in the P&L, but I don't think you'll see the refunds from a cash standpoint. In fact, we may see some a little bit of working capital flipping in the back half of the year.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Gary, on Merian, you're getting pretty close to commissioning. And I'm just wondering, first of all, what are the main items that your teams are focused on to complete construction? What would you identify as really the critical pass at this point in time? And when should we be thinking that commissioning activities begin?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We really have been in the middle of commissioning activities currently. When you look at things like power station, that's been tested and commissioned and handed over to operations. We're now in the process of beginning to test the mill, and doing that with waste to make sure that all of the different elements of that work well. So, we're kind of working through from there into the rest of the system. I mentioned we've got quite a bit of ore already stockpiled there. So, we're in good shape from the mine standpoint and all set up. So, it's really now just going through the different steps of commissioning and handing over to operations to different facilities. The team's done really a great job in constructing the facility and looking forward to it producing first gold here later this quarter.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Are there any construction activities continuing, or are they really just winding down at this point in time?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Really the major things are all complete. We're now in the wind down. We've been winding down now for several months in terms of the number of contract employees working there to build the operation. So, we're now into that stage of really switching over to commissioning and punch lists.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. All right. And then at Yanacocha, if you're going to contemplate the sulfide development and move it forward, what kind of processing circuit should we be expecting? Is there going to be a component of refractory processing that will be required?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's really a two-step process. It's not so much refractory. I guess, depending on what you call a copper, gold, sulfide concentrate, I'd never called that refectory in my past life. But I guess, where it needs ongoing processing beyond that whether it's a smelter, which you could do in this case or what we have been studying and testing actually here in Denver at some of the labs is using an autoclave to separate the copper and the gold out from that concentrate, and also put the arsenic in a stable form for storage. And that's really the arsenic that's the challenge here in terms – the technical challenge that we're working through. We believe we have a technical path. We've got to work through the different steps. The other part of this process would involve a copper leach process. And we've been testing the bioleaching and the FXEW (48:20) process. Actually, it's not only Integral for recovery of copper from the leach pads, but it also would be Integral with the part of the process post processing concentrates through the autoclave to produce the copper. So, it's a little complex. And we're working through the details, but that's at a high level with different components we're going to be using.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Is there a potential to develop or produce a saleable copper concentrate albeit with higher arsenic content?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You could produce it, but there's very few places in the world you can get that processed, and you'd suffer big penalties as part of that by diluting. There is a small part of the ore body that has lower arsenic, so you could segregate and produce some concentrate for sale with a lower arsenic concentrate. That would be part of the detail we'd be going through in the mine planning, but that wouldn't be something that supports a concentrator in its own right.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And then for our next question, it's from Lucas Pipes of FBR & Co. Line is open.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to maybe ask a little bit more broadly on your capital allocation strategy. You have a very strong balance sheet. Your free cash flow generation has been incredibly impressive. When I look at slide 18, your ROCE and free cash flow per share compare very well against your competitors. So, Gary, first, where do you think share buybacks fit into kind of your use of capital considerations? And then secondly, how do you think about M&A in the current gold price environment? Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Lucas. I think in regards to share buybacks, it sits a little further down the list. I think more importantly, we'll look at what changes we'd make to the long-term dividend payout before that would fit into any consideration. And I think the fact that we do have a gold price linked dividend, we do take into account higher cash flows as they come from the higher gold price and look to share that back with shareholders. In terms of M&A, we were successful last year with our acquisition of CC&V in a lower gold price environment at a time when AngloGold needed the cash. And it was an opportunity that we were able to capitalize on and we see that in the results in terms of how that fits in. Where it makes sense, where it fits and improves the quality of our portfolio is something we'd always consider, but it's got to be done at a value that makes sense to us and to our shareholders.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Got it. And in terms of the kind of geographic footprint, do you like your current exposure? So, should we be thinking about maybe add-ons and the right fits within that context or after the Batu Hijau sale maybe with other emerging countries that could find their way into your portfolio?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the expertise we have in the current operating regions is good, and it's good to leverage that expertise there in the first instance. You look at the projects that we have in line at Ghana that we've talked about for consideration not only later this year, but out into the future with Ahafo North and other potential underground developments, one that I mentioned that we've added to the list at Akyem. Clearly, the regions that we're in we're comfortable with. There's a couple areas exploration-wise I pointed out in the map before that we're looking. Ethiopia would be one area that we're looking at, very early stage development. We're looking in the northeast part of Australia, in Queensland, obviously in a region that we understand well. So, we'll continue. We always look at all of the operations we have, projects and then external opportunities on the same value versus risk matrix, where we look at value in terms of NPV and return. We look at mine life and the position of the asset on the cost curve. Risk will look at the geopolitical risk and the technical risk of the asset. And if it's something that can improve our portfolio characteristics overall then it'd be something we'd consider.
Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Lucas.
Operator: And therefore our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotia. Line is open.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on a good quarter.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. I have two questions, Gary. I can't let you get away without talking about Yanacocha again. So, my first one is on Yanacocha. Can we come back to the sulfides, the Integral, can you remind me exactly how many ounces are we talking about there, gold contained?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to have to take a look. I've got to check that one before I can come back to you.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Yeah. I'm just trying to understand, yeah, just how many ounces is in that deposit and the internal rate of return of that greater than 15%. Is that still in $1,200 gold price?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. That'd be looking at our current longer term assumptions hurdles that we like to see achieved at $1,200 gold and at a $2 copper price.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. I'm just making sure that these sulfides don't require a higher gold price. So, it's not gold price pendant, it's more metallurgical that we're focusing on. And then at the same time, I know we're just focused on this Integral, but when we look at the whole Yanacocha sulfide camp, do we have an idea of how many ounces we're talking about? I've tried to find it. I just can't.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: How many ounces, I don't know the answer to that. We're going to have to get back to you, Tanya, on that.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll have to get back on that one.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. That would be appreciated. And then my next question and moving on to Ghana and back to the Ahafo Mill Expansion, I noticed that you tweaked your production profile for the Ahafo Mill Expansion downward by 25,000 ounces for the first five years. Can you talk a little bit about what's changed there?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a bit of how you might bucket the capacity between both the mill expansion and I mentioned the synergies with the underground. So, we're continuing to work through in the feasibility study what the final amount is as we go through it, and then provide more detail here as we would announce the project's progression later this year. Just coming back on your question on Estudio Integral, and I know that using those types of prices we see 5.7 million gold equivalent ounces in that potential development. And that's a mixture, obviously, about what I would say, probably about one-third gold and two-thirds copper at this stage, but that still moves around a little bit.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And I'll wait for the entire camp ounces when you have that number. But just coming back to the Ahafo Mill Expansion, and I understand ultimately you're trying to see what's coming in from the expansion and what's coming in from the underground, but the underground didn't change. So, it's sort of, I've lost this 25,000 ounces. I know it's small on an overall basis. So, I'm just wondering if you just didn't tweak up the Subika Underground or...
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll get more detail as we bring it forward here in October to provide you and the rest of the market. Some of it's just better understanding of grades too because we've been doing lots of drilling and all the different elements or hardness figures into that as well.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. And so, there is maybe something in the greater hardness that has caused this reduction?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We'll run through and provide the detail in terms of how we expect both the plan and the plant to be operating.
Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.: Okay. I guess I'll have to wait for October then. Okay. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: Thank you. And that'll be all for the phone-in questions. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gary Goldberg.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you all for joining the call this morning. The Newmont team delivered another great quarter, and I'd like to thank them. Our sites are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to one of the safest among all industries, taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline and maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, repay debt and return cash to shareholders. Thank you again, and have a safe day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may all disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-21 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Analysts: John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada) David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc. Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker) Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia) Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co. Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter earnings call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide two. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I will turn it over to Gary on slide three.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont. We continued to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and costs at our operations, bringing proceeds from non-core asset sales to nearly $2 billion, building four profitable growth projects on time and at or below budget and strengthening our balance sheet and earnings and earning the best credit rating in the gold sector. Finally, we added two highly experienced miners to the Newmont roster to lead our business in Africa and Asia-Pacific. Turning to specifics on slide four. Our underlying business improvements for the quarter included reducing total injury rates by 37% compared to last year, lowering our all-in sustaining costs to $828 per ounce and dropping our 2016 cost outlook by another $20 per ounce and increasing gold production by 4% to 1.2 million ounces and copper production by 3% to 38,000 tonnes on an attributable basis. Our portfolio improvements for the quarter included reaching commercial production ahead of schedule at the new valley leach facility at Cripple Creek & Victor, selling our stake in Regis for $184 million and advancing our growth projects. Merian is 80% complete, Long Canyon is 65% complete and our second decline at Tanami is nearly finished. Value creation for the quarter included delivering adjusted EBITDA of $803 million on the back of higher grades and production at lower cost and sustaining capital, generating free cash flow of $227 million while continuing to self fund for growth projects, reducing net debt by 16% and completing a $500-million bond tender which will lower our cash interest payment by about $28 million annually. Long-term value creation requires exceptional safety and sustainability performance. Turning into slide five. Our team worked without any injuries at Twin Creeks, Ahafo and Akyem in the first quarter of 2016. We've lowered our total injury rates by 58% since 2012, and we continue to work toward our ultimate goal which is to send all of our people home safely every day. In 2015, our sustainability performance was rated best among mining companies by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and best in the areas of climate strategy, labor practices, human rights, corporate citizenship and environmental management. Newmont is also ranked as the top mining company in the S&P 500 for environmental, social and governance performance and in the top 10 overall according to Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score. The score is intended to measure a company's capacity to anticipate and manage risks and help investors weigh this competency on a consistent basis. You can read more about our performance on our website, where we recently published our 2015 sustainability report beyond the mine. We're also continuing to improve our operational efficiency. Turning to slide six. We brought our all-in sustaining cost down to $828 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. This represents a 2.5% improvement versus the prior-year quarter and a 30% improvement since 2012. About half of these savings were realized through sustainable cost and efficiency improvements at all of our operations and higher production at our lower cost operations. Running our operations more efficiently starts with solid technical fundamentals. For example, better resource modeling, which has improved ore body reliability at Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha, an advanced process modeling technology, which we're using to improve recoveries at Boddington, Phoenix, Yanacocha and Ahafo; and to bring the Cripple Creek & Victor Mill to full design capacity. Finally, we're raising our technical game in underground mining and using improved techniques to manage ground control issues at Leeville, which includes some of our most prospective underground resources. Our costs also benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates and lowering capital spending. Sustaining capital was lower primarily due to timing, but we also expect some savings as the year progresses. Turning to production on slide seven. We're on track to meet production guidance of 4.8 million ounces to 5.3 million ounces of gold in 2016. Factors contributing to this performance include drier-than-expected weather in Indonesia, which allowed us to continue mining higher-grade Phase 6 ore and improve productivity at KCGM and Boddington in our Asia-Pacific region; new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which increased our North America production by 13% versus the prior-year quarter; and strong performance at Akyem and Ahafo in Ghana. These increases more than offset declines in South America, as we reached lower grade and transitional ores at Yanacocha. Looking forward, we expect higher second half production at Cripple Creek & Victor and our Leeville underground mines, which will offset lower production due to planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. In Indonesia, we applied for our export permit ahead of schedule to facilitate a timely renewal. Our discussions with certain parties who are interested in acquiring our stake in PTNNT continue, but financing and deal terms have not yet been finalized. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. The work we do to improve the value of our operations also applies to our portfolio. Turning to slide eight. Our overarching goal is to build a portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risks we're well equipped to manage. We've realized $1.9 billion from the sale of non-core assets since 2013, most recently selling our equity stake in Regis for $184 million. And we've deployed capital to self fund our most profitable growth projects, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we have increased mine life by about 2/3, lowered costs by nearly 20% and improved our technical and social risk profile. The expansion at our newest portfolio addition, Cripple Creek & Victor is progressing ahead of schedule. Turning you slide nine. This is a photo of the new valley leach facility which began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. The recovery plant is also on track for completion by the end of the year. Finally, we finished modifications at the Cripple Creek & Victor mill which accounts for about 25% of the operation's production. This expansion, along with new mines at Merian and Long Canyon and the expansion at Tanami, will add up to 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs as these projects come online. We're also adding capacity in our leadership ranks, starting with our board of directors. Noreen Doyle succeeded Vince Calarco as Chair of Newmont's Board earlier this week. Noreen has been a director since 2005 and has served as Vice-Chair and Head of our Audit Committee. Her background includes executive leadership at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and board leadership at Credit Suisse. Last year, she was appointed Chair of the British Banking Association. Vince will continue as a Newmont Director and will work closely with Noreen to ensure a smooth transition. Turning to management. Tom Palmer steps in as Chief Operating Officer on May 1. Tom brings 22 years of mining experience to this role, the last two of which had been at Newmont strengthening our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. Tom will pick up where Chris Robison left off, driving the next wave of safety and operational performance improvement across the portfolio. Steve Dumble takes Tom's place as Head of the Asia-Pacific region. He's a 34-year mining veteran, whose background includes leadership roles in a range of commodities for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Alcoa. And Alwyn Pretorius joins Newmont as our Head of our Africa Region bringing 20 years of gold mining experience to the role. Both Stephen and Alwyn have track records of delivering successful projects and transformative change in the areas of safety, productivity, sustainability and leadership development. We are pleased to have them on the team. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excluding $0.38 per share of non-cash tax valuation allowances and $0.20 per share for the gain we achieved on the sale of our stake in Regis, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.34 per share. The valuation allowances are related to a tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary acquired back in 2002 as part of the Normandy acquisition. Below, you can see a similar outcome in adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, also excluding the gain on the Regis sale. Turning to slide 12 for a look at our first quarter operational performance. On top line results, gold and copper pricing were down a bit from the prior-year quarter. Attributable gold and copper production volumes held relatively steady year-over-year. You will note that copper sales volumes were up 13% from last year as we were able to catch up on some of the delayed shipments from Batu Hijau in Q1 as we had expected. Gold CAS was up 4% from the prior-year quarter predominantly because Yanacocha is now producing more deep transitional ore. This is in line with our expectations. But you'll also see that overall gold CAS is down significantly from Q4 2015, as expected. Gold AISC improved versus the prior-year quarter in part due to timing of explorations and advanced project spending. As Gary mentioned, we expect to see cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and Merian comes online. However, the second quarter will be impacted by scheduled maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6. Turning to slide 13 for a summary of first quarter financials. Higher volumes allowed us to deliver higher revenue despite slightly lower gold and copper prices. We delivered strong Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, essentially in line with the prior year, reflecting continued strong operational performance across the portfolio. During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $227 million. As I have mentioned, we expected lower free cash flow in the first half of this year, but strong operational performance, commodity tailwinds and a bit of timing came together to help us deliver an outstanding start to the year. The only real difference compared to last year's first quarter was working capital movement. For example, an increase in accounts receivable was in line with the stronger sales volumes during the quarter. We also maintained our dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. Now, turning to slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the first quarter and how we've applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Cash from core operation, where operating cash was sustaining capital from our operating site, generated over $400 million this quarter, plus we received $184 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Regis. A primary use of cash in the quarter was the $186 million of development capital spent to support our future. This was primarily spent at Merian, Long Canyon, CC&V and Tanami. We also completed the debt tender, which I will talk more about in a minute, and paid our quarterly dividend. In addition, given our comfort level with the local cash position and our overall liquidity, Yanacocha paid a dividend. Part of that was paid to our partners and part to Newmont in the U.S. The restricted cash and other is primarily movement out of cash and into restricted cash to cover the scheduled payment on the PTNNT revolver next quarter. Net-net, at quarter end, we have about $2.5 billion of cash and equivalent to repay debt, fund growth – profitable growth and return cash to shareholders, in other words, to continue delivering on our capital priorities. Turning to slide 15 to discuss the balance sheet. Newmont has lowered net debt by 37% since 2013. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.2 times remains among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet across the gold cycle. To do that, we target net debt to EBITDA of 1 time at $1,200 gold and seek to lower our absolute level of gross debt. Turning to slide 16 to talk more about our debt schedule. In the first quarter, we completed a $500-million debt tender, targeting near-term maturities and highest interest rate debt. On this slide, you can see we paid down $274 million of the 5-1/8 notes due in 2019 and $226 million of the 6-1/4 notes due in 2039. This action had an NPV of $133 million and will lower our cash interest by about $28 million per year going forward. We continue to target between $800 million and $1.3 billion of debt reduction through 2018. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Upside that is not reflected in our current outlook includes more Full Potential savings, which we have netted more than $1 billion in improvements to-date and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been through the board approval process. We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.3 million ounces in 2016, rising to between 5.2 million ounces and 5.7 million ounces in 2017, as new projects come online. In South America, higher margin ounces for Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and at Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside not represented in our guidance. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and higher stripping at Boddington. Strong operating performance translates to strong financial performance. Turning to slide 19. We reduced our all-in sustaining costs by $279 per ounce or 24% between 2012 and 2015, an improvement that was more than double the competitive average. We also reduced net debt by $1.7 billion over the last two years for a total reduction of 33%, which compares favorably to an average net debt reduction of 1% among our competitors. Our return on capital employed was about 80% higher than the gold sector average, and our 2015 free cash flow yield was also higher than the average. Turning into projects on slide 20. Merian is 80% complete, about $100 million below budget and on track to reach commercial production later this year. Long Canyon is now 65% complete and remains on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. And the Tanami expansion is on budget and ahead of schedule with additional production expected in the second half of 2017. Finally, Our Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is progressing ahead of schedule and on budget. Together, these projects will add up to $1 million ounces at average all-in sustaining costs of around $700 per ounce. Our next tranche of projects is not included in our long-term outlook. These could add 250,000 ounces of annual production and reduce all-in sustaining costs by another $30 per ounce. Projects that will be considered for full funding in 2016 include the Ahafo mill expansion, which would leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs; the Subika Underground mine, which will deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource; and incremental expansions at Northwest Exodus and Twin Creeks underground. Turning to exploration on slide 21. Exploration is one of our core competencies and it's key to long-term value creation. Our team discovered 70% of the ounces we'll produce this year and has added more than 115 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Our competitive advantage rests on our proprietary technologies, which are deployed by an expert team of nearly 200 geoscientists around the world and our land position which includes 52,000 square kilometers in prospective districts, 75% of which are in North America and Australia. In 2015, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. These additions more than offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces. We also maintained the highest reserve ounces per share in the gold sector. Our annual exploration budget is just under $200 million, and we'll spend about 75% of that amount adding higher margin ounces just in time to support our operations. The remaining 25% will be spent on new discoveries mainly in brownfields around our existing mines with some optionality in greenfields in each of our regions. Turning to slide 22 for a closer look at North America. The Rita K – Pete Bajo area located Southeast of Leeville is an exciting exploration story with significant upside potential. We've identified new trends using this proprietary deep sensing geochemistry technology and, in 2015, increased our resources by about 130% with 16% higher grades. You can see the layout of the 3-kilometer mineralized corridor in this plan view. Less than 1/3 of the mineral inventory has been converted to reserves and resources and a significant percentage is yet to be drill tested. Mineralization also remains open in all directions. Turning to slide 23. These long sections shows more detail. Drilling at the Fence/Full House trend has delivered 250,000 ounces of reserves and 450,000 ounces of resource at exceptional grades. We plan to drill another 10,000 meters in 2016 to further define this deposit. Rita K is a new host discovery, contiguous with our Pete Bajo mine. We expect to declare first resource in 2018 and to drill another 9,500 meters in 2016. Now, turning you to our view on gold fundamentals on slide 24. In the near term, we anticipate that a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth will continue to constrain metal prices. That said, we've seen some notable improvements in the first quarter of 2016. Gold price increased by about 16%, the strongest upward trend since 1980. And electronically-traded fund holdings increased by 20%, reversing significant declines since 2011. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals. On the supply side, three-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012, and mining supply is expected to decrease by more than 5% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect demographic trends in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the two countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million by 2020, and India's middle class is also expected to double and surpass 500 million by 2025. In the meantime, we're prepared for all scenarios. Turning to slide 25. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we would expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost and capital, fund projects and exploration that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy. Summing it all up on slide 26. We're proud of what we've accomplished over the last three years, and we're continuing that trajectory in the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, our sights remain set on raising our performance to the next level. You can count on us to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices; building a stronger portfolio of longer life, lower cost mines and generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects; reduce debt; and return cash to shareholders. Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Sir, you have an open line.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, Gary, everybody. Congratulations on the results. Just wondered if there are any sort of catalysts with respect to the Batu deal. You said it's not finalized yet, but you sounded quite optimistic. Just wondered if there are any catalysts. And then, maybe just a follow-on. The Subika-Ahafo project, just wondered if, after the cost cutting you managed to achieve at Merian, whether there was some hope to bring those costs down as well. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you. On Batu, really, nothing has changed in terms of – we continue to work with those potential parties to finalize deal terms and to make – get the financing put together. So, no other catalysts that I would point to other than those two key areas. In regards to Subika and Ahafo, we continue to go through the final steps. It's permitting. It's probably one of the bigger things at Subika to bring through, and the timing of that still is looking for both Subika Underground and the Ahafo Mill to bring those forward in the third quarter, late – well, actually, early fourth quarter for approval by the board. There are synergies between the two. We're carrying them separately, so we understand what each one is individually. But there are synergies of bringing those two together, John.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Andrew Kaip from BMO. Sir, you have an open line.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Thanks very much, Gary, and congratulations to you and your team on a solid Q1. My question is regarding Merian. Can you provide us a bit more detail on how you're preparing to enter into commissioning? You're in a tropical environment. If it's – if I'm not mistaken, the rainy – the second rainy season begins in the fourth quarter. And I'm just wondering how you're preparing to enter that operation into commercial production through the remainder of 2016.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question, Andrew, and we're looking still here in the second half of this year to enter into commercial production. We will have a little closer view of when that may start when we do our second quarter results in July. We do stockpile material, and we'll be stockpiling. We currently have, like, 1.2 million tonnes, 1.3 million tonnes of ore stockpiled right next to where the mill is. So, we're in good shape. That's a little over a month' supply of ore that's there to be able to handle, and that's part of the design we have. And we based it off how they did the design at Rosebel as well, where they had the same concerns as they work through the rainy season and the dry season and how we operate in other places around the world. So, I think, with the stockpile, that puts us in a good position to be able to work through the rainy season as we go through startup, and that's progressing really well. As I say, the construction is looking very good. Chris was just down there about a month ago reviewing progress, and we're pretty pleased with how that whole project continues to progress and progress at lower cost of capital than what we expected to begin with.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): All right. And then, just given the guidance that you started off with at the beginning of the year that you felt the first two quarters would be free cash flow neutral to consuming cash, Laurie, I'm just wondering what your view or your outlook in the second quarter is. Are you still of the view that the capital programs will consume operating cash flow in the second quarter?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I would expect that the – we would spend more capital. We did have a good tailwind with gold price in Q1. And as you remember, our oil price assumptions are somewhat on the conservative side, perhaps, so we could benefit from those. Well, we did see some timing of capital happened in the first quarter that probably will be made up in the second quarter. So, it was a good quarter, but we do see the second quarter being a little bit of a dip. And as Gary and I both mentioned, Carlin's Mill 6 will go down for maintenance, so that will impact the quarter as well.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then, we'll see the stronger second half as these projects start up.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right, exactly.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Haughton from CIBC. Sir, you have an open line.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary and Laurie, and the rest of the team. Thank you for hosting the call. First question is looking at CC&V. You've had this asset now for nearly three full quarters. Just wondering if anything could have surprised you on the upside or downside since you have taken ownership.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'm going to have Chris Robison, who is down there most recently, to walk through some of the work as we – especially as we begun Full Potential.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. David, I think I'd look at it in two pieces. Obviously, the leach, we've been able to bring the new valley leach online sooner than expected. So, certainly, an upside there and that will continue through the year as we complete that project. The mill performance – so, if I shift gears over to mill performance, we continue to improve that performance and are very pleased with the progress that we've made there. And as you may recall, the next phase of the mill, which, again, is obviously something that we've talked about before, but taking concentrate to Nevada potentially starting next year. So, first phase was getting the mill up to full performance. Phase two is really simplifying the flow sheet and taking concentrate to Nevada, which is a good excellent synergy with the demand for heat value in the roaster and the autoclave.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, overall, we're still very comfortable, David, with the 10% mining cost improvement that we built into our acquisition plans and feel comfortable we'll be able to do better than that. But I'd just say we just started our Full Potential project, and we'll go through that and have more updates through – well later in the year.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Just to follow on from Chris' comments there about the mill. The recovery at the mill was a touch lower than what we would have expected. My recollection was that you're kind of targeting the high-70% and then you could probably get a little bit more out if you put the tiles onto the leach pads. Where are you kind of expecting the recoveries to go for the balance of the year?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, fair question. Those recoveries are pretty much in line with what we had expected, David, I think high 60s. And then, that's through the mill and then – as you may recall. Then, when you put it out on the leach pad, you pick up another roughly something 12%, 15% over time as you would from the leach.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. If I could just switch over on an operational question for Batu. So, you've had some reasonably good weather based on your introductory comments there, Gary. Ordinarily, we would have expected the better grades to come through in the second and third quarter. Just wondering what we should we be thinking about as far as where that grade may go given the kind of changes in the weather patterns that you're seeing.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Basically, we had drier weather in the quarter, so it allowed us to stay in the bottom of the pit in the higher grade part of the ore body for a longer period of time. So, what we've done is accelerated production and moved it forward from later this year and even from 2017, we'd expect, if we have a normal sort of a rainy season pattern. I think the only piece that I'd flag is we looked and we've got our export permit that we've – we've filed our application to move forward is making sure we get that on time. That could be something that could affect our second quarter shipments if that doesn't come through in a timely manner. But basically, I'd see our overall production up slightly from what we had forecast overall, and it's pulled forward.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: And with those permits, Gary, are they now becoming a little bit more systematic in getting the granting of it or is it a case-by-case basis?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's been case by case. It's still tied to, obviously, the requirements we have with our mine plan, and that part works pretty well. I think the other pieces are work to support Freeport as they look at the smelter, and we continue to work with them in those plans. But that sits within the bigger picture of how overall smelting development and the changes that I know that they're looking at for their contract to work and how that all fits in.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: With a bit of luck, it will be someone else's problem by the time the year ends.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I wouldn't quite go there, but we will continue to operate it as if it's ours and going to continue to operate it that way.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Tanya Jakusconek from Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, you have an open line.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good morning. I think it's Scotiabank. I just wanted to ask two questions, if I could. The first one is on Leeville. Gary, can we get an update on how the costs are doing at Leeville? I think, last quarter, we were in some difficult ground conditions that needed additional support and I think we were supposed to get through that in the first half of the year. Can we just get an update on where we are on that and whether that's still the plan?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that still fits very well, Tanya, in terms of what we're doing. We're actually using a different type of rock bolt, a longer cable bolt in the process. We're seeing very good results out of that, but we're having to go through and re-bolt in a number of areas using this new type of bolt and that will take through the second quarter. So, we'll see the higher costs, as we said earlier, in the first half versus the second half of this year.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my second question is on Batu Hijau. Sorry to come back to Batu. I just wanted to make sure that I understood. Is it safe to assume, Gary, that all of the technical due diligence from the interested parties has been completed? Is that a safe assumption?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's a safe assumption. We're looking at financial – or the deal terms as well as making sure they have the financing now.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): And my second question on that is, are the deal terms something that still need to be negotiated? Or have those come to sort of an agreement and we're only really waiting for the finances – the financial to be put in place in order to complete this deal? I'm just trying to understand what the outstanding issues are.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. It's really elements of the deal terms and the financing that remain. So, both of those areas still remain outstanding.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you for that. And sorry, if I could, ask one last question on Ahafo. I know that you mentioned that – and John asked the questions on the synergies of the expansion and Subika Underground. I understand perhaps you don't have the financial implications. But maybe just qualitatively, what would synergies of putting those together be?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's synergies and a bit infrastructure, power – and really, where you bring ore in into the sequence, it's a mine plan element and you're able to shift some of the lower grade out and have more capacity. So, it's grade related. We'll have more details on that when we get to the point of actually having approval, and we'll share that information with you and the rest of the market.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): And so, you mentioned it is grade related. So, obviously, that could help the cash cost in the earlier years. But if you mention infrastructure, could that also happen to help the capital?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It helps a little bit, but I wouldn't say it's more on the operating cost side than on the capital cost side.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Sir, you have an open line.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Good morning, guys. Perhaps a question for Laurie. I think Andrew Kaip touched on this a bit earlier, but just digging into the cash flows a little bit further. In that quarter, there was the accounts receivable increase and also the Yanacocha dividend, but you offset some of these by having lower CapEx, from what I understand, in the first quarter and you'd expect the CapEx to go up in the second quarter. Do – can we expect some of that accounts receivable to come down again in the second quarter that might offset the CapEx? Just trying to think through the next couple of quarters a bit more on the cash side.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Terry, for that question. We do – I would expect that accounts receivable to come down. We had unusually high sales compared to production in the first quarter. We had mentioned at the end of last year we had some Batu shipments that did not make it through to sales. And so, we had that come through in the first quarter. But we will be expecting to ramp up some of the capital costs in this quarter. And the Yanacocha dividend, we don't factor that into free cash flow. That was more of a financing activity of moving that through similarly to Regis.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. So, is there any update on how we should think about that Yanacocha dividend going forward?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I don't think that we would be doing that on a regular basis. It's something we want to make sure that we leave enough cash at Yanacocha to fund the upcoming activities in what might be happening. But we felt that there was enough cash there, and we felt it was appropriate to dividend it out to all the partners including to us at corporate, which allows us to use some of that for debt pay-down and things like that.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Sure. And just on the interest expense, so I think your guidance is down $10 million for the 2016 year, but I think you might have mentioned a $28 million saving from the payback of the debt. Is that just because it's been done partially through the year or what's the – how do I square that?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Thanks, Terry. Two things. One, it is partially through the year, but also perhaps the bigger factor is as we've spent – we're spending a little bit less on capital, so our capitalized interest goes down. Our guidance is expensed. So, we have some that moves to capitalized interest, and that number has gone down so more of it stays in expense.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. And one final one. If Batu was to be sold, what does that mean for cash release, i.e. how much of the current cash balance is set aside for Indonesia at the moment?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's really part of the deal terms that we'd be working through, so I think it's best to hold that question if we're – for another time.
Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Robert Reynolds from Credit Suisse. Sir, you have an open line.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Hi. Good morning, guys. Going back to Batu Hijau again. My question relates to the 17% effective economic interest that Newmont gets through, I believe it was a loan it made to PTPI. And I'm curious how that 17% would be treated in the event of a sale of Batu Hijau. Would Newmont receive proceeds for the 17%, or is there a loan that PTPI would repay to Newmont? Any color there would be helpful.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good question, but that fits all within the overall elements of the deal terms that we're working through. So, nothing more I can share at this stage.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Are you able to provide any color on the size of the loan that was made to PTPI?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I believe that you should be able to find what you need in the disclosure note. Let me get back to you on that. Just – I'm familiar with the loan balances. I'm just not sure what – where to point you to, to point that out. So, we'll come back to you on that.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And I don't think it's specifically disclosed in our Q.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc: Okay. That's it for me.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Karl Blunden from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you have an open line.
Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just also – another question here on Batu. I know you can't disclose much about the expected size of the proceeds. But I mean, I think it's fair to assume there would be some cash proceeds from the sale if it were to happen. If that happened, how should we think about the use of those proceeds, potentially a mix in your corporate priorities between debt reduction and investing for future production. And then, I think a follow-up there is, if you were to target debt, do you have a sense of – you've been balanced between near-term and longer-term debt. I guess, giving some – giving us a sense that you're focused on the cost of debt take-out, but is there – would there be any changes in your prioritization of near term versus long term based on your view of the market and liquidity?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Laurie cover the second part in terms of what debt we would target. If we are successful, the cash proceeds we would see being used both to continue to pay down debt as we work towards our net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 time at a $1,200 gold price and then use proceeds to continue to fund our own organic growth projects. We see we have the best organic growth pipeline in the industry. I wouldn't see accelerating, but use the cash to invest in those projects where they make sense, where they're profitable. In regards to what debt we'd target, I'm going to hand it over to Laurie to cover that.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Gary, and thanks, Karl, for the question. I think we will definitely continue to target a mix. But as we get closer to some of the near-term debt, we might prioritize that a bit more than what you saw in the tender that we just executed.
Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very, very helpful. Just in terms of the size. Obviously, you can't disclose the size but is it feasible to think that you may be able to achieve your full target debt repayment for the 2016-to-2018 period much sooner than the net window then?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, our targeted debt reduction payment does not rely on these proceeds. That's what we believe we can do from our operating performance. So, obviously, if we did get these proceeds and did use that to pay down debt, we would exceed that number.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And what we've achieved already here in the first quarter has put us on pace to...
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Exactly.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not only meet, but likely exceed that target that we've put out there for the next three years.
Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fantastic. Thanks for the disclosures, and congrats on a good performance.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Karl.
Operator: We have a question coming from Eliot Glazer from Wm Smith. You have an open line.
Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.: Well, thank you, Gary, for a very thorough report. My question is, in your gold ounces predicted for 2017, 2018 and thereafter, do you include Batu Hijau?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What we have is the Batu Hijau production is in there in 2016, 2017, also 2018, 2019 and 2020. But then, we're processing off the stockpiles. What we've not included is the Phase 7 investment, so that's not in the capital guidance and it's not showing up in the cost. It's primarily capital and the capital range we'd expect is $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion that would begin in 2017, if we are to move forward. But to do that, just as a reminder, we would need to have our Contract of Work changes defined and agreed, and we would need to have – as we've done with Phase 6, we need to have third-party financing – non-recourse project financing that would be set up to do it. And of course, it would have to make economic sense and have the returns to fit in that area. So, those would be the three things. But back to your key question on guidance, we've not included Phase 7, but it does show Phase 6 through 2016, 2017 and then the processing of – it's as if it would have been back if you go back and take a look at 2014 and the first part of 2015 in terms of production levels.
Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.: I'm sorry, sir, but I still have a follow-up. According to bloomberg.com, it's likely that you're going to have to sell more than you said so far in exchange for about $2 billion in cash. Are they right? Are they wrong?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I didn't follow the question. Say that again, Eliot?
Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.: According to a number of articles that ran on bloomberg.com, there's an investor group trying to raise $2 billion to buy a larger portion of Batu Hijau than you said in your previous explanation.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Those numbers – I can't comment really on what's in the press. I think, when we look at the value, there's a value for Phase 6 and there's a value for Phase 7 out there and beyond. Those would be the pieces that we would be looking at. So, when I talk of the development cost for Phase 7, that doesn't include the revenues and the value we get from Phase 7. And of course, it didn't pick up the value we get for Phase 6 in the equation.
Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.: It was not very thorough. The last question is, are you going to be forced to sell a significant portion at some point by the government of Indonesia?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. The only requirement that we have under our Contract of Work is a further 7% divestment. That has been on the table with an agreement to sell, and the government hasn't progressed that in almost five years that we've had that agreement. So – but I don't see – divestment has never been an issue in our discussions with them on the Contract of Work. We've divested already 44% of our interest there, and that has not been an issue with the government.
Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Eliot.
Operator: That is the last question on queue. Speakers, you may continue.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much. Thank you for joining our call this morning. Our team continues to deliver strong results as we did here in the first quarter of 2016 by driving safer and more efficient operations; a portfolio of longer life, lower cost assets; an experienced and successful exploration team; an exceptional project pipeline and success rate; and a stronger balance sheet and credit rating. We'll continue to build on these foundations as we work to make Newmont the world's most profitable and responsible gold business. Thank you again, and have a safe day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Newmont Mining Fourth Quarter and 2015 Year End Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for question and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right, thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide two, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website, newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide three.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio, and a more resilient balance sheet. This performance is the outcome of our work to instill greater discipline in how we manage our business, to make value our watchword, and to drive accountability deeper into the organization. While economic growth and metal prices were generally subdued in 2015, we made measurable progress on our strategy to become the world's leading gold business by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to cost, strengthening our portfolio and creating value by funding our highest-margin projects, reducing debt and paying steady dividends. I'll turn to slide four for the highlights. Starting at our operations, last year, we lowered injury rates by 18% to among the lowest in the mining sector. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining costs by 10%, marking six consecutive quarters of keeping them below $1,000 per ounce, and we increased gold production to 5 million ounces and copper production to 166,000 tons on an attributable basis. Moving to our portfolio, we acquired Cripple Creek & Victor, a cash flowing asset in a favorable jurisdiction and progressed the new leach pad and mill. We divested non-core assets, including Waihi and our stake in Valcambi, bringing total asset proceeds to $1.7 billion since 2013. And we completed the Turf Vent Shaft on time and under budget, giving us access to higher grades and a platform to expand the Leeville mine. We advanced Merian, where we lowered capital from our most recent guidance by another $50 million and remain on track to begin commercial production later this year. We reached the decision to fund the first phase of Long Canyon in Nevada, and an expansion at Tanami in Australia, and we've added 5 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit. Turning to our balance sheet, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 29% to $2.7 billion despite a 9% decrease in realized gold price. We more than doubled free cash flows to $756 million, reduced net debt by 19% while continuing to invest in growth, and paid $52 million in dividends and delivered first quartile total shareholder returns versus our competitors. Our sustainability performance also influences our ability to create value. Turning to slide five, in 2015, Newmont's sustainability performance was rated best in the mining industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also ranked first in the areas of climate strategy and environmental management, labor practices and human rights, and corporate citizenship. While it's hard to put a dollar value on sustainability, it's clear that superior performance is a prerequisite for managing long-term costs and risks and maintaining the social acceptance we need to operate. The most important way we measure sustainability is by how well we look after our people. Our goal is to send everyone home safely every day. We're making progress by continually lowering injury rates, and we achieved more than 400 days of zero harm at a team, but this performance was overshadowed by the loss of two colleagues in 2015. Our work to improve safety and productivity will never end. Turning to operational performance on slide six, in 2015, we lowered our gold all-in sustaining costs for the fourth year in a row, ending below $900 per ounce. This represents a reduction of 24% over the last three years. Our Full Potential Program has been a central force in improving our performance and our competitive position since it was launched in late 2012. To date, we've delivered more than $1 billion in improvements against the 2012 baseline and consistently exceeded our targets. We've launched the second phase of this program at about half our operations with the remainder scheduled in 2016. Better technical practices are also driving improved reliability. We can't control metal prices, but we have been able to narrow the gap between estimated and actual tonnages and grades, metallurgical recoveries, cost and productivity through more predictable orebody modeling. Finally, we benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates in 2015, which accounted for about 60% of our overall cost improvements. Turning to portfolio improvements on slide seven, our goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risk we are well-equipped to manage. We have optimized our portfolio over the last three years, and you can see the results of our efforts on this slide. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we're able to increase mine life by about 2/3, lower cost by nearly 20% and lower technical and social risk. I'll take a minute now to walk you through what we're doing to manage risk and make the most of our opportunities in each of our regions. Turning to slide eight, in North America, the Turf Vent Shaft was completed in November and is now delivering better air circulation and design capacity. Ventilation is so good, in fact, that people are wearing coats in the Leeville underground mine. The team has fine-tuned ground control plans at Leeville and is currently evaluating alternative mining methods. Production and costs were negatively impacted by geotechnical challenges in the fourth quarter, and we expect that trend to reverse in the second half of 2016. We started mining at Long Canyon and remain on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. Finally, we're making good headway with the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. Leach pad construction is slightly ahead of schedule with first production expected in the second quarter. Mill availability has also improved, following a scheduled shutdown in December and further improvements are expected in the first half of 2016. Turning to South America, in Suriname, Merian is about 2/3 complete, and I'll talk more about that later. In Peru, we're studying a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits, and we'll have more to tell you in the second half of the year. I also want to touch on the reclassification of Conga reserves to resources. This was triggered by certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015 and uncertain prospects for future development and permitting. We do not anticipate development of Conga for the foreseeable future. In Africa, we have secured a new investment agreement and built permanent energy capacity in Ghana, both of which create the stability necessary for long-term investment. Moving on to Asia Pacific, the Tanami expansion project is on track, with the second decline well underway and mill expansion construction beginning in mid-2016. Additional production is expected to come online in 2017. In Indonesia, we received our export permit about two months late, and the delay affected our sales revenue in the fourth quarter. I also want to address speculation about the potential sale of Batu Hijau. Newmont, with our partner, Sumitomo, are in discussions with certain parties who have expressed serious interest. But to date, none has secured fully committed financing or final deal terms. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. Before I hand over to Laurie, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer, for playing a leading role in creating safer and more efficient operations and a stronger portfolio and project pipeline over the past three years. As Chris retires on May 1, we have an exceptional leader in Tom Palmer taking his place. I've known Tom for more than 15 years. He has a long track record of improving operational performance as he did over the past two years at our Asia Pacific business and we share a strong commitment to safety and productivity and to building the next generation of profitable new mines. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was a strong year for Newmont, both operationally and financially. Let's turn to slide 10 to review the financial highlights. For the full year, gold costs applicable to sales and gold all-in sustaining costs were both down 10% compared to 2014 and finished below the midpoint of our guidance. Likewise, gold production was up 4% and above the midpoint of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, gold production was strong and roughly in line with the prior-year quarter. As expected, costs were higher than the previous three quarters. Gold CAS and all-in sustaining costs per ounce were both 8% unfavorable to the prior-year quarter due primarily to lower mill grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo. Consistent with our guidance, CAS is expected to improve by the second half of 2016 as we ramp up production at CC&V and Merian reaches commercial production. Now turning to slide 11, we delivered over $750 million of consolidated free cash flow in 2015 and generated a 49% improvement in cash from continuing operations despite the 9% drop in the gold price. Our adjusted net income for the year was $507 million or $0.98 per share. And I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was up 29% from the prior year, benefiting from strong copper and gold sales volumes and lower costs applicable to sales. Turning to the fourth quarter results, adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was strong but lower than the prior-year quarter due to lower metal pricing. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow and existing cash balances. Last week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share in line with our gold price-linked dividend guidelines. Turning to slide 12, let's walk through our net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our quarterly GAAP net income include a $0.25 tax adjustment, the majority of this relates to tax restructuring and acquisitions and divestitures; an $0.18 non-cash reclamation charge at one of Newmont's legacy sites, this accrual adjustment is for liabilities that will be spent over many years into the future; a $0.03 one-time payment related to prior-period royalties from the revised Ghana investment agreement; and a $0.06 impairment of other long-lived assets and marketable securities. After adjusting for these items, we reported net income of $20 million or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was also impacted by the non-cash reclamation charge, the revised Ghana investment agreement and asset impairment, in other words, the same items except for taxes, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $466 million for the quarter. Now, turning to our capital priorities on slide 13, we delivered a step change in financial flexibility and maintained our investment grade balance sheet despite lower metal pricing through a disciplined approach to project development and capital allocation. In 2015, we generated about $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. After sustaining capital, cash from core operations totaled $1.4 billion. At the end of the year, we also had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a 16% improvement from 2014. This includes 2015 net cash from divestitures of about $200 million. Our strong cash flow and total liquidity position of over $6 billion supports our capital priorities of funding profitable projects, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. As you can see during the year, we spent $655 million on development capital, repaid $454 million of debt, and paid $52 million in dividends. Free cash flow was negative for the fourth quarter, primarily due to timing of development capital spend for Merian and Long Canyon. We had positive cash from core operations of $27 million in the quarter, which didn't cover our Q4 development capital of just over $200 million. It's worth pointing out again that we continue to expect positive free cash flow on an annual basis, but we may not see it every quarter due to timing of development capital expenditures for our growth projects. As I noted earlier, our cash flow from core operations more than covered development capital, debt paydown, and dividends for the year. We're very pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet during 2015, including $120 million of debt repayment in Q4. In light of our strong 2015 financial and operating performance and the current gold price environment, we will evaluate options to further reduce gross debt over the coming months. Slide 14 demonstrates that our discipline has transformed our balance sheet into one of the healthiest in the sector. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.3 times is among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We have reduced our net debt by 19% since 2014 and continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 time at $1,200 gold. This metric may turn higher at lower pricing, but over time, these levels allow us to maintain investment grade metrics across cycles. We work with the rating agencies and talk to them frequently to ensure they understand our strategy and results. S&P removed the negative outlook on our BBB rating in June. They also revised their liquidity assessment from strong to exceptional. Moody's recently placed Newmont and many other metals and mining companies on review. They did this across the board primarily because of their outlook for commodities pricing and their desire to do a review against that pricing deck. In general, the agencies have been very positive about the operating and financial improvements at Newmont. And with that, I'll hand it back to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Laurie. Let's shift gears to the future starting on slide 16. Our goal is to continue improving our performance in prospects by delivering safe and profitable production, adding higher-margin ounces and advancing our best projects, generating the strong returns we need to invest in growth, reduce debt, and fund dividends and maintaining leading sustainability in governance practices. Turning to our outlook on slide 17, our outlook has not changed with the exception of the improvement in forecast capital spend at Merian, which I mentioned earlier. We expect to sustain the savings we've achieved to date through efficient operations, optimized projects and value-accretive transactions, and to maintain gold all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce through 2020. Over the next two years, costs are expected to benefit from higher-margin ounces at Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami, and Long Canyon, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Potential upside includes Full Potential savings and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been approved. Turning to production on slide 18, we expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.3 million ounces in 2016. Production is then forecast to rise in 2017 as new projects come online. After that, we expect profitable production of at least 4.5 million ounces to 5 million ounces through 2020. In the near-term, higher-margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha in South America. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika underground resource. Finally, Asia Pacific will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and the higher stripping at Boddington. Turning to capital on slide 19, our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures over the near-term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. Sustaining capital is expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer-term, we expect to hold sustaining capitals between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital in 2016 and 2017 will support our current projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next profitable growth opportunities. Turning to our project pipeline on slide 20, projects in the execution phase are progressing on schedule and at or below budget. To recap, Long Canyon is more than 45% complete when we began mining in January. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is on track, and the team is evaluating promising options for concentrate processing. Merian was 66% complete at the end of January, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. And the second decline at Tanami is nearing completion, and we will begin mill expansion construction in the coming months. Turning to projects that will be up for funding review in 2016, the Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. Finally, the next cutback at Batu Hijau Phase 7 represents good returns, but requires significant investment. We will not move forward with Phase 7 until we've secured an amended contract of work and project financing. Turning to our reserves on slide 21, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit in 2015 and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. Additions included higher grade ounces at key underground mines, including 1 million ounces at Carlin and 800,000 ounces at Tanami, more than doubling reserves at the Subika underground mine with the addition of 800,000 ounces, and extending the life of KCGM by adding 1.1 million equity ounces, and at Yanacocha by converting 700,000 ounces at [Catcher Main]. These additions helped offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces, divestment of 800,000 ounces, which included Waihi, price-related changes of 3 million ounces largely due to moving an economically marginal layback at a team which is not included in the current mining plan to resources, and net negative revisions of 700,000 ounces, primarily at Ahafo and Ahafo North. The strength of our gold reserves is reflected in slightly higher average year end gold grades of 1.06 grams per ton and reduced sensitivity to lower gold prices. We lowered our reserve price to $1,200 per ounce at the end of 2015. Operational and portfolio improvements, combined with favorable exchange rates, have reduced the downside sensitivity of a further $100 decrease in gold price to less than half of what it was last year. Turning to slide 22, in the near-term, we expect a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth to constrain prices. In the medium-term, supply is expected to decrease due to aging ore bodies, slower project development, and fewer new discoveries. These factors, combined with rising demand from emerging market consumers, support a positive outlook for gold prices in the years to come. In the meantime, we're preparing for all scenarios. Turning to slide 23, our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we'd expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital, and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. If gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize costs and capital, fund projects and exploration prospects that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction, and increase dividends in line with our policy. Summing it all up on slide 24, we're proud of what we've accomplished in 2015, but our sights are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to one of the safest among all industries, taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline, and maintaining leading social, environmental, and governance practices, and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt, and return cash to shareholders. Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Morning, Gary, Laurie, and Tony. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is pretty easy. Can you guys just confirm what you actually spent at Merian in the quarter?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What our actual capital spend was for the fourth quarter at Merian?
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm going to have to look that up here real quick because I don't have it at my fingertips. But we'll come back to that and look it up.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Next one is just on Yanacocha. Could you just, I suppose, comment on what you expect, not on a tonnage perspective, but more so on a grade perspective going forward, especially in 2016, not on production, but just on grade?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Just to answer your first question, on 100% basis, we're about $102 million at Merian. And I'm going to ask Chris Robison to cover where we stand at Yanacocha grade-wise in 2016 versus prior years. What do we expect grade-wise?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Andrew, as you know, the grade was expected to drop, and so, our expectation, as you can see, the ounces in 2016 were down in the 500,000-ounce range for 2016. And in the foreseeable future, there's – it's roughly half of where we had been two years ago to three years ago and then as we stepped down in 2015.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Do you think it's something between a fourth quarter and a third quarter growth, or is this some sort of – do you think it's going to be consistent with fourth quarter, or is it going to be sort of more between third quarter and fourth quarter?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I think – Andrew, I think it's pretty consistent with fourth quarter as grade has ramped down. So, I think pretty consistent through the year. We'll certainly be consistent through the year, and it's similar to fourth quarter.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And, Chris, I would think you'd say that our guidance that we've given from a cost basis for 2016 is based on the analysis of the grade, and it's going to be – we're still going to deliver that which is...
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Oh, absolutely.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: ...a bit better – lower than the fourth quarter cost.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. And they've done a great job in focusing on cost with the declining grade and reducing head count and other significant costs.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. And I swear it's my last question, back to Merian, obviously, it's 66% complete. What – do you think – it's great you gave a downward revision to CapEx. Do you think that – do you foresee any more downgrades to CapEx given the project is sort of almost there?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think what we'll be doing, Andrew, is as we get it closer to commercial production, we'll assess where that stands. I think right now we were comfortable making this next reduction. I think the team has done a great job of delivering. Chris was just down there a couple of weeks ago, I was down in December, and just impressed with how the whole project is coming along. But I think we'd hold off to probably midyear or third quarter as we get into commercial production to reassess capital.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks very much, guys.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Bridges of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Morning, Gary, Laurie, everybody. I just wondered on the costs, all-in sustaining costs, you're using GAAP to do your numbers. If you were able to use IFRS, would you all reported all-in sustaining costs be lower? What are the issues between the two systems?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would say that over time, there wouldn't be any difference. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, there could be some differences as under one, you might capitalize, on another you might expense, but it actually does a lot to equalize things across the two methodologies.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Are you doing a lot of stripping at the moment? Are you stripping more than normal or about average?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I wouldn't say – I mean, in Carlin and Twin, we'll have some stripping campaigns over the next couple of years, Carlin currently in one and Twin will come back into one. So those would be the two areas that I'd see any – I wouldn't call it abnormal. It's just a normal part of their mining cycle. Of course, Batu Hijau if we were to get into Phase 7 would be into one of those as well down the road a couple of years.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Okay, fine. And then maybe as a follow-on, Yanacocha, you mentioned the sulfides project. I know you're still working on it, but I just wondered if you have more detail there, idea as to what the better options were they?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Not at this stage, John. I think we're still sticking to our schedule of reviewing that with the team in June and have more to talk about it in July.
John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. We look forward to that. Thanks, Gary, and best of luck.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions on strategy. First of all, in 2017, obviously there's likely going to be more development capital allocated than is shown on slide 19. But when you look at capital allocation decisions vis-à-vis organic projects in the feasibility or the pre-feasibility stage versus acquisitions, could you talk a little bit about – and, again, CC&V is a good example of an acquisition that's strategically fit; talk about the balance between acquisition strategies and organic growth, particularly as you go from 2017 into 2018 where production on paper and without the new projects kicking in, stepping down significantly in 2018 from 2017.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: True, Stephen, I think, first of all, step back. Our core focus is on making sure our operations, the business delivers value. So we're not out for a target of a certain number of ounces per se. It's what's going to deliver the best return to shareholders. So that's why you've heard us say we've announced certain projects, talk about return on capital. That's a big focus. And clearly, we understand our internal projects the best generally. So that's a key focus that we look at. But we do take a look at what's available out there around the rest of the world in terms of opportunities. We weight all of our operations, our internal projects and external opportunities on the same value and risk scale where we look at value, NPV, return on capital, mine life and position on the cost curve. We look at risks from a technical and a geopolitical and social risk aspect and really make all the decisions based on that in terms of how we then allocate capital. We're targeting roughly 20% to 25% of our free cash flow today to be paid back in dividends. We're working towards a position of getting our net debt to EBITDA, targeting, as Laurie said, a 1 time ratio at a $1,200 gold price and investing in the business along the way. And as you point out, we're making quite a bit of investment. You see that in our free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we'll see that in the first half. Primarily, it's front-end loaded in 2016. But that kind of gives you a little overview of where our focus is really driven and what's the best value to shareholders is the main driver.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that, Gary. Just again as a separate question on strategy, we've talked in the past about synergies or potential synergies between operations in Nevada, and certainly in 2014 there was discussion at that time of a combination with Barrick, which could considerably generate a lot of synergies, particularly in Nevada. Do you see opportunities in Nevada where you could partner with somebody and achieve synergies, whether it's at Turquoise Ridge or elsewhere the metallurgical operations in Carlin?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think clearly we're focused on running our operations. Just we're joint venture partners with certain parties in Australia where we're managing the KCGM operation now. We're partners at Turquoise Ridge, and we continue to work to look at what the next development opportunities are. All the ore at Turquoise Ridge is processed at our Twin Creeks operation today. And looking at ways to be able to expand that relationship and develop the best value for our shareholders in that process is one of our focuses. So, I wouldn't look away from them, but right now, those would be the areas that we're focused on.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much, Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Gary and everybody. I guess, my first question, Gary, just again on strategy, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the fact that your U.S. copper operations are basically below breakeven on an all-in sustaining cost basis relative to the current copper price, and if there would be any plans to brown down production there in response to low copper prices? That's my first question.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, I think, there's two parts and that's the Phoenix operation in the U.S. that's producing copper. You've got the copper that comes with the gold in concentrate and you also have the copper that comes from the SX/EW. And we do have probably more flexibility around SX/EW if we were to see a significant decline in copper prices where it wasn't making money on a cash basis. But at this stage, we don't have any plans to make a change. But that would be the one we'd have probably the most flexibility initially to make a change on.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, when you define running them for cash, you define that as C1. You're not thinking AISC cash as being the breakeven?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. If we get down to it, we'd be looking at C1. But we'd continue to assess that as we go forward.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And as Gary said, part of that is in with the concentrate and so, you really have to look at the combined copper-gold because there is an allocation of cost which can be somewhat academic and isn't always guaranteed to be 100% accurate. You're really looking at the combined product and what margin you get out of that.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And then, just that leads into sort of my second strategic question, when you guys think about potentially selling assets in certain parts of the world and reinvesting, where does copper rank relative to gold? Are you kind of metals agnostic or are you leaning more towards increasing your gold projects going forward?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're very confident at operating gold operations around the world. We do have the three copper-gold deposits that we operate today, but our focus would be on gold primarily. But if there was something of value that was gold with some copper with it, we'd consider it, but our focus is really on gold, Jorge.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And sorry, if I could just get a last one in for Laurie, specifically, Laurie, if we could just get a better baseline and maybe just an explanation as to what continues to happen with the other expense category. I can understand a lot of that is non-cash. But just looking at your year ahead guidance, it seems to imply about a $250 million midpoint for SG&A, including – I'm assuming that category includes others given that your actual SG&A runs at about $180 million. So, I'm assuming – is it correct to think you're using about a $70 million assumption annually for others?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, the other thing is we talked about this at Investor Day that we have moved our regional G&A into G&A and out of other, so you're going to see some changes in that going forward. And we can give you a lot of detail, if you'd like, offline. The other is a fairly complex area, and a lot of it is non-cash, as you mentioned. But it should be coming down as we make some of these changes that will provide a little bit more transparency.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. That would be great to get some more color there just because, recurrently, it seems to be an area of negative surprise, and on cash basis, I mean, this does work out to be somewhere upwards of about $40 an ounce, give or take, annually. It would seem like some fairly low-lying fruit if you guys could get a better handle on controlling those recurrent others. So, I just wanted to flag that. Thanks.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. And we definitely take a look at it, and we'll get back to you with some more detail, Jorge.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jorge.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaip of BMO. Your line is now open.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Good morning, Gary and Laurie.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Good morning. The first question I have, Gary, is just for you. Thanks for providing some clarity on Batu Hijau and the fact that you have parties that are interested. I'm wondering if you're in a position to just comment on the quality of those groups that are interested. Do you see them as viable groups that are just assembling up the capital to be able to make an offer, or is it – can you comment on that?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I am going to ask Randy to give a comment.
Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development: Andrew.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Hi.
Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development: Yes. The viability is certainly high enough that we felt appropriate to mention, and they're serious parties like we mentioned at Investor Day. We've really only engaged in parties that we felt were viable. Financing in this market has been challenging, but I think that's the case across the sector. So we certainly view them as very real parties.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): Are you looking at more than one group that is interested? Or is it just one particular group that is entertaining it?
Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development: I think we've looked and talked to a number of groups. We've got some serious interested parties right now that we're focused on our discussions with.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): All right. Thanks very much. And then, the second question, Laurie, congratulations on further debt reduction. I'm just wondering and you made comments about potential further debt reduction or gross debt reductions early this year or into 2016. Can you comment on your strategy now? Still a very healthy cash position in Newmont, and I understand the need for it is clear as you're constructing projects. But at some point in time, those cash requirements are going to abate, and I'm wondering what your strategy there is?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thank you, Andrew. And, yes, I think the whole team deserves a lot of credit for this debt paydown. We don't do it in finance. But we definitely have some project-level debt at PTNNT that we expect to be paying down throughout the year. And then we've also considered the concept of doing a tender on some of our outstanding corporate debt. We do have the cash, as I said, in December. We're monitoring the gold price and want to make sure that we don't take undue risk. But as you point out, where we're at right now, both financially and where we are within our projects, that definitely could be something on the horizon. We just have to make sure that the timing fits with all the other things. And as you know, we get into the blackout windows and everything around our quarters. So, our timing to be able to do those things can sometimes be limited. But we definitely, obviously, have the capability, and we'll be studying that quite a bit going forward.
Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada): All right. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Haughton of Imperial Bank of Commerce. Sir, your line is now open.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Gary, Laurie, Chris, and Randy. Got some questions on the CapEx. Firstly, looking at Merian, you've put guidance there for 2016 of $170 million to $210 million. Is that on 100% basis, or is that your 75% share?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's 100%.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Excellent. And during the presentation, Gary spoke to some $50 million worth of savings. What kind of savings were generated? Is it as a consequence of currency or energy or some other element that you'd want to talk about?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, David, I think, it comes – obviously, it's exchange rate and fuel price plays a big role there. But also, from my recent visit there, mining has some very unique approaches in terms of logistics which you can imagine is pretty interesting, getting gear into the Amazon Jungle, where we have saved costs, and even in assembling gear there, where a lot of equipment is obviously fabricated, but then assembled in Europe, in the U.S. or Canada, and then transported in and basically just bolted together. And so, as we do more of that, that's probably after FX and fuel price, biggest savings is less labor cost and less high-tech labor at site.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And I know that Andrew Quail had asked – was heading in a similar kind of direction. Your sustaining CapEx is about $100 per ounce. Can you see any of those kind of experiences moving over to your ongoing CapEx, or is it really quite specific about the build capital?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's more specific. I think a big sustaining project, something where there was a lot of gear, I think we've learned a lot from that. But we would certainly take these ideas to other big projects in the future. Some great experience there and knowledge we've gained.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, it's transferrable, say, to what might happen in Ghana, for instance, if you push the button for the expansions?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Absolutely, yes. And in .
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Yes. Just going over to Long Canyon the CapEx remaining is around about $250 million to $300 million. Is that up from what your previous expectations were?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it's pretty well in line with expectations. We're assuming a bit lower spend there again mainly due to fuel costs, but should be pretty line-balled of what we had previously forecast.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, our $250 million to $300 million is full project spend from the beginning. So that hasn't changed at this stage.
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Only about half of that in 2016.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay, all right. Well, thank you very much and, Chris, enjoy your retirement.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: I have two questions, one is technical and one is financial. Maybe just on the technical side, can we talk a little bit about the geotechnical issues that you were experiencing at Leeville, exactly what's happening there? I understand there's more ground support that's going in, but what are you seeing underground that's different from what originally you were expecting and how do we see this cost improving through the year? So maybe that's my first question.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Tanya. I'm going to have Chris handle that one.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, Tanya, I think a couple of pieces to this. One, it's one particular area in Leeville, so it's not an impact across the whole Leeville/Turf complex. It's one area where due to the faulting, while we had an expectation there of poor ground conditions, our current mining approach, the long hole stoping leads to more geotech issues. So, one of the things that we're looking at is a cut-and-fill approach in this particular area of the mine. That would lead to more selective mining, so higher grade, higher cost that may offset one another as you'd be mining less tons, higher cost but higher grades. So, we see the impact of this through – because of this area, it's an isolated area in the mine, the impact this year, but certainly not longer-term.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: So is it safe to say that we're just in the sort of faulted area for the first half, and then once you come out of it, we're back to long hole stoping?
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yes. And we would be long hole stoping elsewhere in the operations. Just this one area, we would go to this modified mining approach.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, Laurie, a question for you, and I appreciate you mentioned your target for net debt to EBITDA at 1 time at $1,200 gold price. Is it safe to assume that, we've got obviously the Merian CapEx that's coming through in the first half of the year, you have to make a decision on Ahafo, Subika in the second half of the year. Do we look at it that any excess cash flow above that spend that assumes you've made the decision to go ahead on Ahafo and Subika, still keeping a minimum cash balance of $2 billion on the balance sheet, anything above and beyond that would go to paying down the debt?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I think we would certainly evaluate a variety of different things, other options that we might have, what does the gold price look like at that point in time. Theoretically, you're probably not far off about what we do, but there would definitely be timing and other things that would come into play before we would move on that. But I definitely see the ability for us to pay down some incremental debt this year.
Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: Hi. Thank you. I think you mentioned lower ore grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo as the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in your total cost per ounce. But it looks like your North American cost – CAS, were up about 9% and was driven by Carlin. Remind us why your cost is so much higher at Carlin? And looking at 2016, are you expecting your cost per ounce in that region to come down as the year progresses and as production ramps at Turf Vent Shaft and so forth?
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, overall – I mean, first of all, our cost came down year-on-year and just to remind folks, especially all-in sustaining and we have had the moves around Yanacocha as we get closer towards the end of the existing mine life. We have expected those costs to come up as production comes down. Carlin was a factor of some of the items that Chris mentioned as we're dealing with some of the geotechnical issues plus came to the end of some stripping and some grade-related issues. Our guidance still that we provided in early December in terms of where we expect our cost to be for 2016 hasn't changed from what we provided and still remains the same.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: And the Paceville project at Carlin would have impacted cost.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That would have affected sustaining capital in the fourth quarter spend, yes.
Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And then your leverage ratios have obviously come down a lot over the last several quarters. Remind us whether you have a target leverage ratio. And if so, what is your target?
Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. What we've said, Garrett, is that we'd like to be at 1 times debt to EBITDA when gold price is $1,200. Obviously, the EBITDA moves around a bit as the gold price moves around a bit. But if we think about it that way, we're confident that we can maintain investment grade metrics as the gold price moves in through the cycles.
Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets: All right, great. Thanks very much.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Garrett.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back to Gary Goldberg for any final remarks.
Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'm pleased with the changes we've made over the past few years that have positioned Newmont to be the world's leading gold business. We'll continue to focus on our strategy to deliver long-term value by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to costs, strengthening our portfolio, and creating value by funding our highest-margin projects, reducing debt, and paying steady dividends. Thanks, again, for joining us and have a safe day.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-31 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Jeff Wilhoit - VP,IR Chuck Jeannes - President & CEO George Burns - EVP & COO Lindsay Hall - EVP & CFO
Analysts: Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs John Bridges - JPMorgan Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Greg Barnes - TD Securities Patrick Chidley - HSBC David Haughton - CIBC World Markets Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank
Operator: Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc Q3 2015 results conference call for Thursday, October 29, 2015. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you. I'm Vice President of Investor Relations, but thank you anyway. Welcome to the Goldcorp third-quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Projects. For those of you participating on the webcast, we've included a number of slides to support this afternoon's discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amounts of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Back in 2011, Goldcorp embarked on an ambitious program of concurrently financing and building two new high quality gold mines in two very different jurisdictions, Eleonore in Quebec and Cerro Negro in Argentina. Today, our third-quarter results illustrate the operational and cash generating strength that we envisioned when we first set out on this now completed mine construction program, even as the gold price has significantly weakened over the past four years. These capital investments have greatly enhanced our asset portfolio and positioned Goldcorp to provide strong free cash flow generation, even amid the current gold price environment. This cash flow also allowed us to pay off our revolving credit facility this quarter, enhancing what we believe is the strongest balance sheet in the gold sector and positioning us for long term success, regardless of metal prices. We're pleased to report record quarterly gold production of 922,000 ounces for the quarter, as these new mines assumed a greater proportion of overall production and our flagship Penasquito mine continued its steady run of strong performance. We also reported all-in sustaining costs at $848 per ounce. We had inventory write-downs at our two Mexican mines, primarily due to gold price and excluding these non-cash write-downs, all-in sustaining costs were an even stronger $802 per ounce. Adjusted operating cash flow met expectations, totaling $374 million or $0.45 per share and we saw another quarter of growing free cash flow, as I said, reaching $243 million or $168 million after payment of our dividend. Looking more closely at our operational performance, I continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of Penasquito and we'll exceed our production guidance there between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces for the year. We also saw strong production at Cerro Negro and Musselwhite. At Eleonore, production doubled from the prior quarter, despite some teething pains. Eleonore is a very high-quality gold mine that is only going to get better, as the team there works through the issues. Remember, this is a big underground mine with a two-year ramp-up to full production and we're on track with those overall expectations. At all of our mines, as well as at the corporate office, everyone at Goldcorp is 100% focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. What we call operating for excellence or O4E. As I've said before, we're well aware that in a flat gold price environment, the only way we can provide margin growth is through declining costs. As you saw in our all-in sustaining cost performance this quarter, we continue to meet this challenge. And cost control will continue to be a prime focus, as we complete preparation of our 2016 budgets. Reflecting our confidence in the portfolio, we reconfirmed our production and cost guidance this morning, with production expected to be at the upper end of between 3.3 million and 3.6 million ounces, at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $900 per ounce. We decreased our DD&A guidance to $450 an ounce from prior guidance of $425 per ounce -- sorry we increased. Lindsay will elaborate on those accounting items shortly. With our new project capital investment spend winding down as planned, we've also reconfirmed overall capital spending between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. We remain well-positioned for a strong finish to a great year. As I'm sure you're aware, the market performance of the gold miners has outperformed the price of gold over the last several months, as investors begin to absorb the reality of improved operating and financial performance of the sector at a lower price environment. We believe there's more room for relative out performance, but we also believe we're getting close to the end of the gold bear market. U.S. Fed actions and inactions, Asian economic data and the other factors have done little to dampen the world's appetite for owning gold. Regular participants on our quarterly earnings calls may be familiar with this slide, depicting the likelihood of a peak gold scenario and I include it here again to illustrate what I believe is an emerging trend in support of a higher gold price over time. As at least one of our counterparts in the base metals world has recently reminded us, the best cure for low commodity prices is low commodity prices. This is certainly true in the gold industry, where we've seen that it's nearly impossible to make a new discovery that's economic at $1100 gold. The message here is simple. Gold supply will be tightening going forward and those companies like ours with the best assets will be uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend. Looking ahead, we remain focused on what we can control, delivering safe production at low all-in sustaining costs to achieve our 2015 guidance. We will also seek to translate the exploration success we've seen this year at Cerro Negro, Eleonore and other sites to at least replace mined gold reserves, even at a lower reserved price. In terms of news flow, we're in the midst of work on our 2016 budgets and updated mine plans and we look forward to providing our guidance expectations for 2016 and beyond, early in the new year. I remain extremely excited by the opportunity to sustain Goldcorp's compelling investment proposition further into the future and look forward to speaking with you then. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to George.
George Burns: Thanks, Chuck. I'm very pleased to report Goldcorp's mines delivered safe third-quarter gold production of 922,200 ounces at low all-in sustaining costs of $848 per ounce or $802 per ounce excluding impairments. Chuck has pointed out our strong execution at Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Musselwhite, but most of the portfolio delivered at or near production cost expectations quarter to quarter. We also continued to see wins from our operating for excellence program. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized benefits of approximately $250 million. Some good examples across the organization include higher gold and silver recoveries at Cerro Negro, further deployment of remote mucking and drilling at our underground mines, mechanization of the historic Upper Red Lake into lower-cost bulk mining and lower unit cost mining at Penasquito in the mine. Importantly, our teams see further opportunities to lower cost and increase productivity across the sites. At Penasquito, the largest gold mine in Mexico remains on track for a record year. For the third quarter, safe gold production was 236,800 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $467 per ounce. As we discussed last quarter, the higher sulfide gold grades resulted from positive model reconciliation, as mining took place in the heart of the deposit. Gold grades are expected to continue to moderate into the fourth quarter, as we move into a new phase of the ore body. The team at site has done a good job of increasing the mining rate which is driving down our mine unit costs. In addition, we're realizing cost savings following the start-up during the quarter of the Energen electric generating plant. Conversion of natural gas-fired electric power generation will also contribute to a reduction of Penasquito's carbon footprint. Construction of the northern well field remained suspended throughout the third quarter of 2015, due to an illegal blockade by a local community. The site continues to seek a fair resolution of this matter, while taking steps to enforce our contractual rights. Penasquito is also advancing alternatives for completion of the project by rerouting the infrastructure. Contingency planning is ongoing for additional water supply to the Penasquito mine until the well field project is operational. I'm confident water that we need to sustain operations until the resolution will be reached or solemn. The metallurgical enhancement project feasibility study progressed during the quarter and is on track to be completed early in the new year. This study includes both a pyrite leach circuit and our proprietary concentrate enrichment project, each of which will be separately considered for advancement. During the quarter, pilot plant testing was completed and work continued to confirm capital and operating costs. At Camino Rojo, work continued to advance the pre-feasibility study which is on track to be completed in 2016. An update of the geologic model continued during the third quarter and metallurgical testing of sulfite transition and oxide zones also advanced. Cerro Negro continued to ramp up successfully with the third-quarter safe gold production totaling 135,700 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $731 per ounce. Increased production resulted from further ramp-up of mining rates at the Mariana Central and Eureka underground mines. Total tons milled increased, resulting in average throughput during the third quarter of 3,700 tons per day. Average milling rates in September surpassed nameplate capacity of 4,000 tons per day, ahead of schedule. On the exploration front, the news continues to be very positive. We continued our resource definition drilling program, expanding resources at Mariana Central complex, particularly in the newly Emilia vein, where we're seeing strong grades. We're well-positioned to grow gold reserves this year at Cerro Negro. Turning to the work stoppage we announced at the end of September, we're having constructive discussions with the union that represents the mine workers, while maintaining normal operations. Turning to Eleonore, third-quarter safe gold production totaled 86,700 ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of $974 per ounce. As Chuck mentioned, this was a doubling of the prior quarter as a result of the expansion of the underground mine from two to four horizons, additional mine optimization efforts and continued ramp-up of the mill throughput. Throughput during the quarter averaged 6,500 tons per day and some days we have exceeded nameplate plant design of 7,000 tons per day. As throughput is ramped up, the presence of pyrrhotite and iron sulfide has intermittently impacted concentrate leaching circuit kinetics, leading to lower than expected recoveries during the quarter. We're making good progress to overcome this recent issue. As previously announced, prior to our site tour in September, in situ ore grades and initial stopes in horizon four have been as expected, but folding is being encountered. Mining in these areas is resulting in higher dilution and therefore lower than planned mine grades and gold production. The folding is of varying intensity and is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the overall Eleonore deposit. The Eleonore team continues to work on adjusting stope designs to minimize these impacts. Include in that work have been smaller stope designs, improved fragmentation and better material handling. The folding and recovery issues have the potential to negatively impact 2015 production guidance of between 250,000 and 270,000 ounces. We continue to overcome typical ramp up challenges and I'm confident that these are short-term issues that will not affect the long term performance of Eleonore. We continue to receive good news on the exploration front at Eleonore as well that support our expectation for reserve growth again this year. Work on the Eleonore Crown Pillar pre-feasibility studies continued to advance during the third quarter, with completion expected by the end of the year. On this slide, you can see quarter over quarter, the increase in gold production and the throughput, showing consistent performance from the plant. As we move towards the end of the year and the depletion of the low-grade stock pile, the key focus continues on the ramp-up of the underground. Turning to Red Lake, safe gold production totaled 77,600 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,028 per ounce. Production was lower than the prior quarters as a result of lower grades from remnant mining at the Campbell complex, mining in the lower grade sulfide zone and lower than expected grades in the foot wall zone. At our HG Young discovery, exploration continued to advance north from the 14 level at the Campbell complex. This trip provides new drill platforms for follow-up underground drilling on several positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program and we're working towards initial resource by the end of the year. At Cochenour, our exploration drilling continued to assess the core areas of deposit as well as the tram level, where a change in the orientation of the veins was detected. We're advancing detailed interpretation on analysis to support final mine planning and optimal placement of the infrastructure to set this mine up for long term success. Processing of mill feed from the initial sill development work was consistent with expectations. rilling is confirming pre-acquisition results in the upper portion of the deposit. We believe Cochenour will be a strong contributor to Red Lake in the future. Work is ongoing to define the timing of initial stope production and ramp-up of Cochenour feed for processing at Red Lake. With that, I will turn the call over to Lindsay.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks, George. As demonstrated with our record quarterly gold sales, the growth and the contributions of our recent Los Filos gold mine helped onset the downward pressures the industry is experiencing in the current commodity price environment. At an average realized gold price of $1,114 per ounce on gold sales of some 942,000 ounces, the Company generated adjusted revenues of $1.3 billion and adjusted operating cash flow of $374 million for the quarter. Byproduct and co-product cash costs for the third quarter were $597 and $670 per ounce respectively, compared to $547 and $656 per ounce in the prior quarter. The increase in cash costs is due primarily to the impact of the inventory write-downs of the lost heat leach value. All-in sustaining costs for the third quarter were $848 per ounce, compared to $846 per ounce in the prior quarter. As Chuck has mentioned, it would have been $46 an ounce lower without stockpile inventory write downs. We reported a net loss in the quarter of $192 million or $0.23 per share. Excluding the usual impact of unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income taxes, adjusted net loss totaled $37 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015, compared to an adjusted earnings of $65 million or $0.08 per share in the previous quarter. Both reported and adjusted net loss were impacted by lower realized metal prices during the quarter and a $40 million or $0.05 per share reduction in the inventory carrying values primarily at Los Filos. We also experienced higher depreciation quarter over quarter due to a change in the mix of our production, with more production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce mines, like Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Eleonore. Additional assets were placed in service that were not forecasted and the $19 million related to the non-cash portion of the inventory write-downs. The Company generated adjusted operating cash flows $374 or $0.45 per share which is before the positive change in non-cash operating working capital of $132 million. Given these operating results and capital expenditures on a cash basis of $263 million for the quarter, the Company generated positive free cash flow of $243 million in the third quarter. Turning to provisional pricing, we had a negative $15 million provisional pricing impact at Penasquito and a negative $1 million impact at Alumbrera. The provisional sales at September 30, 2015 at Penasquito include 155,270 ounces of gold priced at $1,114 per ounce, 4.2 million ounces of silver at $14.65 per ounce, 68 million pounds of zinc price at $0.75 per pound and 28 million pounds of lead, priced at $0.75 pound. While at Alumbrera, we have 18,567 ounces of gold, priced at $1,115 per ounce and 14 million pounds of copper priced at $2.35 per pound. Regarding depreciation and depletion or DD&A per ounce, we expect it to increase to $450 per ounce for the year, from the previous guidance of $425 per ounce, due primarily to the impact of the mix of our production with more production coming from our newer and higher DD&A per ounce sites like Penasquito and additional assets such as the Overland waste rock conveyor at Penasquito placed in service earlier than anticipated. Goldcorp's DD&A per ounce is higher than most of our peers, primarily a result of the fact that we have newer, younger mines like Penasquito, Cerro Negro and Eleonore. The costs associated with acquiring or building these assets are amortized over the existing reserve base, to determine a DD&A per ounce. With these younger new mines, the DD&A per ounce will start out high and as exploration success converts more ounces to reserves which increases the denominator that these costs are amortized over, the DD&A per ounce is expected to decrease. So, while the depreciation expense in the early years will have a negative effect on a reported earnings, it doesn't dilute the abilities of these new mines to generate free cash flows. We're pleased to have generated positive free cash flow after dividend of $168 million in the third quarter. As planned, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility balance. This, in combination with our positive cash balance leaves us with $3.3 billion of liquidity at September 30 and in a strong financial position with one of the best balance sheets in the business. With our focus on mining safe profitable ounces, our efforts to reduce costs through our O4E and invest sustaining capital into our existing mines where it makes sense to do so, given the current commodity environment, we will continue. We manage the business for the long term and with our financial strength, we can make prudent investment choices for today and for the future, when commodity prices rebound. With that, operator, I will turn it back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Quail: First one is on sustaining CapEx. You've obviously, as you said, you're full all this projects which is great. Looking to 2016, do you have, I know you haven't given any guidance, but is there a level of sustaining CapEx that you will be targeting? Is that something reasonable around $800 million?
Chuck Jeannes: Andrew, we're in the midst of our budgeting process right now and it would be premature to give you any specific guidance. In the past, we've talked generally about $1 billion a year. Not just for sustaining, but for those other expansionary capital things that we spend money on, such as advancing the permitting at places like El Morro and the engineering work at Camino Rojo. Things like that. If you were thinking in terms of around $1 billion overall, that would probably make sense. But of course in a lower gold price environment, we look to find ways to bring those numbers down and that's what the budgeting process is all about right now and what we're going through. So we'll have those numbers for you early in the new year.
Andrew Quail: Right, at Cerro Negro, obviously it looks like it's almost at, pretty much at steady state. The grades have been very good the last three quarters. Do you expect that high-grade, we have said in the last two quarters pointed to Q4 and then maybe into 2016?
George Burns: This is George. We're expecting to see further ramp up of Mariana Central and that's where the higher grade ore is at Cerro Negro. Right now, we're processing low grade stockpiles. Those are depleting and expected to be depleted around the beginning of the year and at the same time, we continue to see the underground mines ramp up. Mariana Central, as it continues to ramp up, those grades will increase.
Operator: The following question is from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges: Chuck, I'm sorry you seem to be everybody's favorite short this morning. On Cochenour, can you give us some indication as to what you're seeing down there? We understand the ore bodies is in different shape to what it was before, but does that mean that it's going to be similar levels of profitability once you get there or is it in a different configuration, such that profitability is going to be different?
Chuck Jeannes: There is really two parts to the deposit we're focused on. At the tram level, where we had the first access per drilling, that's where the orientation is a bit different. Our original scoping was long hold mining method. That's still intact. So from a cost perspective and profitability, we have the same expectations. The upper area which was the target for the acquisition to begin with, that's the heart of the deposit, we're getting great drilling results there and our focus next year, we'll be able to touch that part of the lower body and again be able to advance our earnings and planning around that development work. Overall, I would tell you our expectations haven't changed. It's just the timing.
John Bridges: You going to be ready to talk about that early next year?
Chuck Jeannes: As they come out with our guidance for the year and our production plans, we'll be giving everybody an update on Cochenour.
John Bridges: I'm curious, Hurricane Patricia t hit the West Coast of Mexico, it deluged Mexico and you seem to be on the track. Did you get a lot of rain? What you affected at all at Penasquito?
George Burns: I will take that, John. We were all very focused on that and it was quite dangerous, because it was headed right toward Manzanillo where we have our concentrate warehouse and loading facilities. Fortunately, the hurricane turned at the last moment and missed Manzanillo and we had some very slight damage there and nothing that impacted our concentrate loading or any of the boats. There was actually a ship in Port at the time, being loaded. And then as the storm went through the rest of Mexico, yes, we got some more rain at Penasquito, but nothing that impacted us and it essentially missed Filos and El Sauzal.
John Bridges: Any rainfall feelers to dilute the solutions?
George Burns: We've had the normal wet season at Filos and it continued with the storm, but nothing abnormal.
Operator: The following question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Terry: It's actually Chris Terry. Two questions to close out on the D&A that Lindsay spoke about. Would you expect that next year's going to be at a similar run rate to the upgraded guidance to the end of 4Q? Is it going to be sometime before that then comes down with exploration success like you said? The second question maybe for Chuck, just more of a strategic nature. With the costs coming out of the industry and you've done a really good job at continuing to strip those out and generating free cash flow now, if we do see and you're right about the gold price starting to bottom out and we do see the price rise, where will you spend the marginal dollar from here? Is it on a combination of debt payback, new projects, dividends, more exploration spend? Or do you have a priority out of those that are listed?
Lindsay Hall: I will take the first part of the DD&A, again we're getting our budgets together for 2016. I don't expect that to be higher. It will be lower because I don't anticipate impairments of stockpiles which is costing $10 or so an ounce. Also, we feel pretty good about replacement of reserves that will affect the denominator which should drive that number down. Generally speaking, it should be lower, but we're still working on that.
Chuck Jeannes: As far as how we manage increasing cash flow in a rising gold price environment, the one thing I can tell you that we're absolutely certain of is that we're not going to make the same mistakes that the industry made in the past cycle, where we lowered cutoff grades and chased top line growth at the detriment of margin growth and instead just allowed the cost to go up concurrent with goal price. That's not what our investors are looking for. They've made that very clear. Certainly, I've been around long enough to understand that. And so when we see the gold price move, we're going to be holding the line and focusing on increasing cash flow, rather than increasing revenues. And so how we spend that, it's always a combination. Certainly, there will be more exploration as our portfolio continues to be enhanced. We'll have more exploration to spend. We have organic projects already in the pipeline that we're very excited about, that we're working on. Things like HG Young at Red Lake, the metallurgical enhancement project down at Penasquito. We've got Camino Rojo, we've got El Morro, so we've got some great organic projects that we will continue to advance and the more cash flow we have, the more that we can bring those along.
Operator: The following question is from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes: George, I want to get a feel for how you think the mining rate at Cerro Negro is going to trend over the next year or so, with the reserve or below-grade stockpiles gone, you're going to need to fill the mill. I'm wondering how that's going to happen.
George Burns: As I stated, we're looking to continue to ramp up both underground mines. Eureka, we're headed to the 1800 ton a day sort of rate. Mariana Central is approaching 1,000 tons a day today and we're headed towards 1,500 ton a day. So we're expecting both of these mines to ramp up. Eureka is a pretty mature mine. Mariana Central is moving in that direction. We have some minor challenges with voids at Mariana Central that has impacted that ramp up, but we're getting through that. We're basically [indiscernible] the holes with plastic pipe, in order to be able to control the blasting. So we're pretty confident you're going to see those two ramp up. Then, longer-term it's about bringing the next mine into production. We be looking at Mariana Norte where that mine is already restarted as well as the exploration success we're seeing around the Mariana Central complex and all of that is in flux with our good exploration results and our planning for next year. So short-term, you're going to see both of these underground mines ramp up a bit and longer term, it's bringing new production into play.
Greg Barnes: Sounds like next year, you're going to be running around 3300 tons a day?
George Burns: I would say we will be starting the year out around that rate and looking to ramp up further.
Greg Barnes: I want to return to Cochenour as well. I believe there was a plan there for production ramp up through 2016, but that seems to be changing. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think production or mine output from Cochenour is going to go from here?
George Burns: It's early days right now with Cochenour. Unfortunately, the lower part of the mine is going to ramp up a bit slower than we expected. As I stated, we're focus now on touching the heart of the deposit, the reason for the acquisition, next year and so trying to predict how quickly that will ramp up will be dependent upon that development, what we see. What I'd described you now, the ramp-up over the next couple of years has slowed down a bit but I think the endpoint is the same.
Greg Barnes: Should we expected bit weaker production at Red Lake as a whole for the next couple of years then?
George Burns: We were looking for Cochenour to come on as Campbell ramped off. Obviously with a bit of a slower start, we'll be looking to keep their production as high as we can with the Red Lake Campbell complex. We're not going to see the ramp up next year. We had hoped just due to the delay, but I wouldn't be concerned next year's productions going to fall.
Chuck Jeannes: If I can add it's not just something that's material to even the Red Lake camp, let alone the overall production profile, because we only had a few thousand ounces in the plan for 2016, anyway. And now George and the guys are going to be focused very hard on getting that mine development done right, based on the different configuration that we've seen. We would certainly expect to see the production ramping up in late next year and into 2017. Remember, it's all about profitable ounces and that's what we're focused on. And while ounces are shorthand for performance in our business, we're trying to change that, frankly, in the way we talk internally about cash flow. And our cash flow will and is continuing to improve.
Greg Barnes: To put it realize it was only a few thousand ounces, if that's a talking about here it's not a big issue. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: The following question is from Patrick Chidley of HSBC. Please go ahead.
Patrick Chidley: I wanted to ask a question about the change in working capital. Obviously you are healthy with the cash flow. Can you give us an idea of how that's going to be going forward? Have you gotten any plans to continue that trend or is it one quarter it will be positive, one quarter negative?
Lindsay Hall: Patrick, we're always trying to reduce our working capital, but we've had two great quarters and we see it continuing for a while. At the end, it's timing of cash flows and a couple of things, the timing of say when you pay the taxes or you get refunds. In our case too, to a large extent is, did the ship leave the warehouse on time and am I going to get paid for it? That's the concentrate out of Penasquito. Some of those things, predominantly those two things, will always impact working capital and we always focus on reducing that amount, but I can't always guarantee that it will be positive, but it's been strong for the last two or three quarters and we see that continuing. But again, sometime in 2016 you'll have a negative working capital as those cash flows don't come in on a quarterly basis as anticipated or change over the quarterly basis. That's what working capital is supposed to do. We focus on it.
Patrick Chidley: The cash level $257 million is pretty low it seems to me. If something went wrong in the fourth quarter to the cash flow, would you have to go back into the revolver for the plan?
Lindsay Hall: $257 million is a reasonable amount to run the business on. I don't think it would be -- going to the revolver in order to counteract I think that you're surmising as $300 million of cash isn't enough to run the Company. That wouldn't be the case. It's a luxury to have the revolver there undrawn and we don't anticipate using in the fourth quarter, if that's what you're asking.
Chuck Jeannes: I can just tell you that we're a month into the fourth quarter and we know what our business is doing and we wouldn't have paid down the revolver if we thought that we would have to dip back into it in the fourth quarter. We're pretty comfortable with where we're.
Patrick Chidley: Did I hear George say that he feels good about reserve replacement this year?
George Burns: That's correct. We're wrapping up all our drilling programs and in the engineering phase, but we remain confident we're going to have a good year and replace reserves.
Patrick Chidley: That's regardless of whether the gold price you choose is slightly lower or whatever. Is that factored in as well?
George Burns: We're expecting a likelihood we will lower gold price and we're factoring that into our confidence we will replace reserves.
Patrick Chidley: What sort of target are you looking for from the Borden project? I know that you're aiming to actually convert some of that into reserves by the end of the year.
George Burns: We're expecting reserves. The details of that will come out early in the new year, but I'm confident we will have reserves there.
Chuck Jeannes: Remember Patrick, it's about a 2 million ounce resource and will have an initial reserve there, but you need to give us some time to chew through that and get the definition drilling done. Don't expect the entire resource to convert in the first year.
Operator: The following question is from David Haughton of CIBC.
David Haughton: Perhaps to George, back to Cochenour again I'm afraid. Thinking about this orientation issue, can you explain it in words? Are we talking here about the depth, the strike, the plunge, the geometry, continuity? What is it exactly?
George Burns: It's predominantly the strike. Geologic interpretation and strike of the mineralized zone is what's changed. As a result of that, we're doing more advanced expiration and development work to support a clear understanding, so we get the development right.
David Haughton: Ore body extending in a direction other than what you had previously anticipated, I guess it does a result in drilling in a different place to what you had encountered before. Is this more for the step out drilling rig that you're looking at?
George Burns: Not really, it's the orientation of the mineralized zone. We had essentially drill intercepts and we interpreted the azimuth in connection with those various mineralized zones that were at economic rates. As we got into do the development, we're finding it's a bit more complex and the orientation is different than the geologists had projected, so we're making those adjustments and then confirming them with additional drilling and development.
David Haughton: Are you encountering then any pinching or swelling or is there any difference along strike? Do you end up with multiple stacked areas of mineralization?
George Burns: We assume there would be multiple stacked mineralization zones and I guess the way I would describe, some of that is true, in other areas we're seeing wider and different orientation then was projected. It's probably a mix of both. Again, in the end, down in this bottom area, we're still confident we've got economic zones and we're a bit delayed in getting those initial stopes, but they will come. I would probably turn you more to the upper area, where the bulk of the ounces are, the higher grades are and frankly, the larger profit for this deposit is going to come. And as we've advanced development of this mine, that's our biggest focus for next year, as we're drilling on that now and our development will be focused on touching that part of the ore body and again understanding it well enough we get the infrastructure in the right place.
David Haughton: This orientation issue is only at depth and not in the bulk of the ore body that you'll be accessing?
George Burns: Yes, that's the way we understand today. It's just down at the bottom near the tram level.
Chuck Jeannes: David, if I can just add from an non-technical perspective, as we got in and saw this different orientation then we had interpreted, it just didn't make sense to continue with the development work and put all these headings in and then find they're in the wrong place and have to redo them. We want to get the first production from Cochenour. It's important, but it's not so critical that we were going to risk all that development and then find that we had to do it differently. So we step back. We stop. We put some more drill stations in, coming in at different angles, so that we can understand it better and trying to be fairly conservative in what we're telling you because of that we backed off on giving you a date certain for first ounces or a number of ounces. And as we complete the budgeting and we're doing all this work and we talked to you at the beginning of next year with our expectations for 2016, we'll have more information for you there.
David Haughton: Yes. It will be quite helpful to visualize it, but I presume that some of the development that you're referring to would be not the development for ore extraction in the near term, it's a longer-term if it's more at depth that you've got the uncertainty of the orientation?
George Burns: The key is getting the ramp in the right place and from the ramp goes the sill development. We've got to get this orientation right so that we get the ramp ideally situated to minimize lateral development and that's a key to keeping the costs down and the profitability up.
Operator: The following question is from Andrew Kaip of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaip: I'm going to continue on David's theme and just to confirm, ramp development towards the upper portion of the Cochenour deposit has yet to be initiated because you still trying to work out the -- where the best place to place that ramp is?
George Burns: There is the connection between a shaft and the tram, that's now complete. So we have that in place. That was a key to ventilation, secondary egress. Then there's additional ramping required to set up production stoping and level development. The advanced exploration we're doing today is in order to get the ramping and ore passes and waste passes in the right location, given the orientation. So in the lower part that we have now touched and we did some preliminary sill development, that's what we're doing the advanced exploration so that we get all of the future ramp development and sill development in the right place. In the upper area or the heart of the deposit, we haven't touched the ore body there, we haven't done lateral and ramp development of the main infrastructure between the shaft and the tram. So again, we're drilling today and we'll do the initial touching of that ore body next year and from there, as the information increases, be able to get that ramp and sill development in the right place.
Andrew Kaip: The upper part of the deposit, you'll access that via the shaft rather than ramp development from the haulage level?
George Burns: The design of Cochenour, the shift was really put in place to give ventilation and secondary egress. We don't have plans to hoist material. All ore from Cochenour will be dropped down through ore passes to the tram level, brought across by rail on the tram over to the Red Lake complex and hoisted with existing shift. So the Cochenour shaft is really about ventilation and helped in the development connecting the tram and the shaft, but again, it's not going to be for material movement.
Andrew Kaip: And just regarding the HG Young zone, you're currently advancing an exploration access. Can you give us a sense of when you'll be at that zone and when you'll be able to actually physically be able to look at it and see whether your ideas about what it looks like?
George Burns: The bulk of the drilling to date had been from surface and we've got a high grade nice zone that we've been chasing to depth. And so right now, we're doing development from the 14 level that has set us up to be able to drill at the 14 level from underground drilling. As we get that drilling completed and as part of our budget process, we're working on accessing and touching the HG Young. The likely place will be at the 14 level. That's where we're closest to this new discovery. But we're assessing other alternatives over the long haul. Ramp from surface, development from 7 level and ultimately how we develop HG Young will be dependent on the continued exploration success. Right now, I tell you 14 level is the likely place we first touch to start confirming in the ground what we're seeing in the drill bit.
Andrew Kaip: And just switching regions, Los Filos seems to be cluster high in the quarter from an all-in sustaining cost basis. Noticed the grade has been inching up of the last couple of quarters. You're doing some study work. Can you give us a better sense of how you see Los Filos moving into 2016? Clearly its cross structure needs to come down.
George Burns: The first thing I'd point you to, it was a tough quarter, but that write-down played a big impact. It was about $400 an ounce on the costs, you're seeing all-in sustaining costs. That's a one-time hit that's a result of lower metal prices in the earlier write-down. In terms of our focus and we're focused very hard on getting the costs down at Los Filos and there's impacts there just cost focus. The other is inventory reductions. We've seen good progress the first couple of quarters, in the third quarter it wasn't as good as the first two quarters, partially due to the normal wet season at Filos this time of year. And the other thing I'd point you to is, we're focused on injection drilling, in order to get cyanide into some areas of the pad that we've seen through geophysical work are dry. So we expect to get recovery out of those zones and again, pull down the inventory and drive our own sustaining costs down.
Andrew Kaip: How sensitive were those, that material, that inventory that was written down? Is it something that is highly price-sensitive and could potentially, with slightly higher metal prices, come back into your inventory?
George Burns: We essentially, prior quarter, had written it down to current metal prices. Essentially those ounces were written to break even at the metal price in the second quarter. As the price dropped, that forced another write-down. Essentially, if the metal price goes up, then yes, we've got margin again.
Andrew Kaip: That metal price would have to be above $1,200 it sounds like?
Lindsay Hall: Andrew, it's Lindsay. I think it's priced around, more closer to $1100, so anything north of $1100 will start generating margin of those ounces as they come out of the leach path.
Andrew Kaip: Finally, Cerro Negro, it looks like just based on your run rate through the first three quarters, you're actually going to exceed your guidance there. I'm wondering, you didn't point that out in the quarter and is the reservation to do that predicated on negotiations that are ongoing with the unions? Or is it just the fact that the inventory, the stockpile, the low-grade stockpile will be declining and will probably see production or processing rates move down through the fourth quarter?
Lindsay Hall: No. We're expecting processing rates to continue and you're right. Cerro Negro has had a great three quarters. It has a good likelihood of pushing through the top end of the guidance. I'd tell you the only risk would be a union stoppage, but I think that's a very remote risk.
Chuck Jeannes: If I can just add Andrew, we did have a four day stoppage and guidance is an art as much as anything else and one of the things we've thought about and talked about there was, we're still in the midst of negotiations, so let's just leave it where it is and we'll hopefully make it through the quarter and have a good quarter.
Andrew Kaip: What's the chief sticking point, I guess, is the best way to put it?
Chuck Jeannes: Like any labor negotiation, it's a private discussion and we're not going to get into the details of those discussions.
Operator: The following question is from Anita Soni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni: I'll try and be brief here. Just on Cerro Negro, the silver grades coming in pretty from I think Mariana Central and Eureka. Do you expect that to continue into the remainder of the year?
Chuck Jeannes: Can you speak up a little bit, Anita? I'm not sure we got it all.
Anita Soni: I was trying to get color on the silver grades at Mariana Central. They seem to be coming out higher than I guess I had anticipated post-tour.
George Burns: They were a bit higher this quarter, I wouldn't say that level will continue, probably somewhere between September quarter end and the first couple of quarters.
Anita Soni: Going back to Red Lake and the Cochenour, can you remind us where you are in the de-stress lots and sequencing and things like that? I assume with Cochenour ounces delayed until later in the year and even though they are nominal ounces, you are going to start focusing on basically getting those tons out of the Red Lake complex, if you can. I just wanted a refresher course on where we're on the high grade zone and the de-stress.
George Burns: So that we're well underway with that de-stress lot. We've got more than half of it pulled and the rest of it set up, so we're pretty good shape to complete that in the fourth quarter.
Anita Soni: That sets you up for 2016?
George Burns: Yes. It sets us up for Q4 and 2016, yes.
Operator: The following question is from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank
Tanya Jakusconek: I wanted to come back. Anita asked the question on the Red Lake. I wanted to make sure we were back into that higher grade stope for Q4 and then for 2016, that's taking care of that question. Maybe just to come back to Cochenour and I don't want to beat this over again. George, can you remind us the top zone and the lower zone? What proportion of the ounces fit in the top area and what fits in the bottom?
George Burns: The bottom zone, essentially were projections with some drill results from the top zone. The reason why we went after Gold Eagle deposit, I would just tell you the vast majority is in the upper zone, it was and remains so. The only reason we developed the lower area which is not the heart of this deposit, was simply that was the first place we had access to drill.
Tanya Jakusconek: When you say vast majority, is that over 90%? I'm just trying to get a feel.
George Burns: More than two thirds.
Chuck Jeannes: Tanya, we don't have the breakdown of the resource here. Because there was much more drilling in the upper part, that's where the bulk of that 3.4X million ounce resource is today.
Tanya Jakusconek: I was just trying to get an idea from, if we could and we can take it offline, what it says that the percentage from the upper zone and lower and also grades, just to be reminded on that basis.
George Burns: Sure. Just remember it's an inferred resource. That's why we're doing the drilling now to fill that all in.
Tanya Jakusconek: No, no, no, I understand. Maybe just to move off onto reserves, you mentioned that you are looking to a place reserves this year and maybe George, just to remind us what $100 per ounce movement in the gold price does to your reserve base? Number-one and then Cerro Negro and Borden were two that you highlighted as adding to reserves this year. Maybe any other mines or projects that you think could add to the reserve base?
Chuck Jeannes: While George looks that up as far as the numbers, I think he highlighted or he didn't, I highlighted that Eleonore also, we expect to more than replace reserves. Much like we did last year. We continue to have good success drilling that deposit as we get deeper. He's looking up now what the $100 an ounce meant last year. Remember, that was based on last year's reserve. Now we're recalculating them down at the $1,200 level.
Tanya Jakusconek: Just to get an idea from $1,300 to $1,200 what it does. Just Borden, Eleonore and Cerro Negro are what comes to mind?
George Burns: Those are the big movers. On the issue of lower metal price. We're favorably sitting in jurisdictions where FX rate is offsetting. If you assume a $100 drop in gold price, there is really no impact on us overall, due to the exchange rate in Mexico and Canada predominantly.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you, Tanya and I think that's the last of our questions, operator?
Operator: Yes, that concludes the question and answer session.
Chuck Jeannes: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining us on the call today. I know you have a lot to do with a lot of companies reporting. To summarize, I would say that as planned, we've got increasing production, lower costs and a sound balance sheet and certainly delivering that strong free cash flow well in excess of our dividends. We remain on track to continue those trends in the fourth quarter and into next year, even in the current gold price environment. We look forward to a strong finish to the year and updating you on our progress in the New Year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President Investor Relations. You may begin.
Meredith Bandy: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer and other member of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to Slide 2, before to know any further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website newmont.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Gary, on Slide 3.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter and I’d like to walk you through the highlights now. We reduced our injury rates, maintain steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 14$ per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32$ increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014. We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor in Colorado and advance the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations or mines rather Nevada and Merian in Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance, I am pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rates by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont’s lowest ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant approve improvement by our contractors. I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of zero harm is achievable. This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce. Let’s turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has three elements and we are making progress in all fronts. First, to improve the underlying business, we maintain steady gold production more than offsetting the impact of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter. Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of non-core assets to $1.6 billion over the last two years. Turning to organic growth; construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing unscheduled and on budget. The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare dividend despite lower metal prices and pay down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We’ve remained on track to pay down further debt in 2015. Let’s turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tons of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura. Operations around the world contributed to the strong performance. At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise and we mine higher grade ore. We’ll continue to mine higher grades through 2017 and our reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining. Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the full potential program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the mill via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements. Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance. At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements. At KCGM, we’ve commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw an improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production. Turning to Slide 7, and our cost performance, ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvement. We also benefitted from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year, due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha, but we’ll finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I’ll discuss in a moment. This graph shows our progress over the last three years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we are making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges. Turning to Slide 8, Batu Hijau is running at full capacity and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contractive work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our representative workforce. In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Twin and we’ll add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year-end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity. Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing and we’ve remained committed reaching an agreement that offers fare wages and benefits, while sustaining profitable operations. Merian remains on track for first production in 2016 with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete. You can see how we’re progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo; we’ve also stockpiled just over 500,000 tons of higher grade ore. Finally, we’ve began to work to integrate Cripple Creek & Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio. Let’s turn for more detail on Cripple Creek & Victor on Slide 9. CC&V as a surface mine and heap leach operation above 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about two thirds through a $585 million expansion and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V’s operating cash flow. The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery and higher grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute 350,400 ounces of gold production at all in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we’ve indentified. For example, we see potential to lower CC&V mining cost by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plant to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont’s proprietary technology. Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V’s value and mine life, but will require further definition and optimization. With that I’ll hand it over to Laurie, for an update on financial results.
Laurie Brlas: Thanks Gary and thanks everyone for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I am pleased with our performance. Turning to Slide 11, as Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost for ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results. Turning to Slide 12, during the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations and increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year, due to higher grades and recoveries especially at Batu Hijau, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements. Consolidate free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon. Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period. We’ve reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to a $101 million or $0.20 last year. Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that, adjusted new income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, $0.05 per share loss related to impairments and restructuring costs and $0.09 per share impairment of certain differed tax asset. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share as I noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs. Now turning to Slide 14, at the end of the second quarter, our investment grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity. During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily towards the PTNNT revolver. We’ve also eliminated Ahafo remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments to $280 million and we’ve remained on track pay down further debt by year-end. We have no significant debt maturities until 2019 and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant. Newmont’s strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend as we announced earlier this week, despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192. Turning to Slide 15, our work to deliver the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ration of 1 which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet across the verity of metal price scenario. To summarize, Newmont’s strong liquidity and cash flow positions us deliver results across the commodity cycle. We’re comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile, but we’ll continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long term viability of our business. And now I’ll turn the call back over to Gary.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Laurie. I’ll shift gear now to cover our outlook, turning to Slide 17. We’re revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces. We also improved our 2015copper production guidance by about 10%, due to a better phase position at Batu Hijau as we’ve been able to make better progress on 50 watering than we planned. Our revised long term guidance calls for gold product between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017 and 9% increase from previous guidance. In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the three year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1. In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher grade ore over the next three years. A planned expansion at Tanami if approved represents additional upside. In Africa, we expect product to decline over the next three years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects including an optimized Ahafo mill expansion to increase throughput and offset lower grade ore. And the Subika underground mine which would improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, while reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside. In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017, as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We are working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of U.S. $0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from U.S. $0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining cost to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance. At the regional level, we’ve reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper cost. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance. Looking out to 2017, we now expect to deliver all-in sustaining cost to between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged. Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital, our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau is offset by addition development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in line with previous guidance. We’ve reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged. Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector, turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines and we’ve improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner. We remained on track to reach commercial production of the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The Shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100 to 150,000 ounces of higher grade ore at Carlin’s Leeville underground mine. We’re also making good progress at Merian, where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounce of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first five years beginning in late 2016. I visited Long Canyon last week and I am pleased with the team’s progress. First production from this new and highly perspective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining cost of between $500 and $600 per ounce. In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall costs for the first five years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017. In Ghana, we continued to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo mill to help offset the impact of lower grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs. Lastly, we continued to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha’s remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016. Turning exploration on Slide 21, exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base, while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists. Early stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include the Subika underground in Ghana to give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface bit. Long Canyon in Nevada were oxide mineralization has been identified over a three mile strike and remains open in all directions. Northwest Exodus in Nevada and extension of the Exodus underground mine which would add profitable production and Kacher Maine which is part of the oxide expansion effort at the Yanacocha. Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success. Turning to Slide 22, our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami’s high grade underground mineralization from 150,000 in 1993 to nearly a 11million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources. Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits, we still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through extensions at Callie which remains open at depth and at Auron, we’re only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource. Development of two new discoveries Federation Limb and Liberator and close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program with targets like the Soolin Footwall where we’ve drilled intercepts of up to 20 meter at grades of 8.6 grams per ton of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively and expensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill. Turing to Slide 23 for closer look at Auron, this long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program today. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources and the light blue shows inventory or material that is not yet advanced to resource status. As you can see both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We are excited about the drill results today which suggest that extensions are at a comparable thickness in grade with what we’re already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold which you can see in this photo. Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb, Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. Discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Federation’s mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grade from 2 to 200 grams per ton. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per ton in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through infill drilling. Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25, Liberator is a brand new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure. Liberator’s mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and a grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per ton. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We are excited about the potential for a longer term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio. We’re also prepared to weather headwinds. Turning to Slide 26, we run our business to maintain flexibility in a verity of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price. Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take include delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures, further reducing overhead and exploration costs and differing early stage projects. Similarly as gold prices improve, we’ll maintain our cost and capital discipline, continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate out debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we position the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off. I’ll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we are taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Thanks for your time. I’ll open the floor to question now, operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andrew Quail: Yeah, good morning, Gary and congratulations on a very solid quarter again. It’s a positive trends you got over 12 months definitely. Couple of questions, on the pair issues in Ghana, can you easily give us a split between a Akyem and Ahafo, obviously, Akyem is showing much lower cost in heading in the other way where Ahafo suppose you’ve said grades coming off?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, the power consumption in Ghana it’s about 60 megawatts in total with about 30 megawatts at each of those sites. And what we’ve done is put in the temporary additional power at Akyem and we’re finishing up by the end of this year some addition permanent capacity at Ahafo as we look at the potential to add mill capacity there and the potential for underground, we wanted to base the more permanent power there. We have since June and went back to running full capacity, while we continue to work with the government and look at different ways to address the power situation over the longer there. We’re now in good shape for continuing and sustaining our existing production base going forward.
Andrew Quail: Thank Gary. And then in mean on that - on your slide 26 which is very helpful. As far as when you talk about the reduced or the divine laybacks and reduced the full cost. Is that server it’s - have you already sort of plan that by specific mines or is that main and how many mines would that be resuming to it?
Gary Goldberg: And what we’ve done Andrew and as we build our plans and this is something we introduced last year and continue to refine this year. We actually build our plans starting from a lower gold price and layer on, what would we start, what runs, what doesn’t. So we started at a $900 price and then continued looking at what comes in both with existing operation and projects. So we’ve got a pretty good idea where we’d go and where we’d focus and where the best value comes as we’d go the other direction and looking. It’s depending ones again how long we expect these thing to last.
Andrew Quail: And just a last one, maybe it associate Kalgoorlie. Obviously there’s been some noise around sort of direct stepping away there. Can you just give us an update what operationally have that - is that impact Newmont and how you see that asset going forward?
Gary Goldberg: No, I think one other things that we completed in this past quarter, we took over and agreed a management agreement with Barrick and we’ve now taken over managing the operation on behalf of the joint venture. It’s still a 50-50 joint venture. We continue to do work and now with this change, we’re also looking at what we might do both in further bringing our systems and approaches in, but also looking at the exploration upside. So it’s something we continue to assess.
Andrew Quail: Thanks very much, Gary.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Andrew.
Operator: Our next question is from John Bridges with JPMC. Your line is open.
John Bridges: Thanks Gary, Laurie and everybody. Again congratulations on the results. I was just wondering with these expansion projects you’re talking about Tanami and Ahafo, what sort of gold price would you need to press the button on those two projects?
Gary Goldberg: It varies on both on them. At Tanami, quite frankly because it’s - well both of them quite frankly are incremental expansions. We see prices that would support good double digit returns. It could below even a $1,000 per ounce. We’ll give more information as we assess those here in the third and the fourth quarter and bring them forward, but that’s where I see quite frankly both of those.
John Bridges: Okay. And then following on the layback question, and looking at your results from last quarter, your layback, your strip ratios are following most of the mines. Is that normal value variation or was there a degree of sort of adjusting to another price already in your numbers? And then I was in tread at - what was it - at Twin Creeks, the strip ratio there is much higher but is not showing up in the cash cost, I just wondered what was driving that?
Gary Goldberg: Okay, I’ll take the first part on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio, because those are probably the two biggest drives of Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what’s going on. I think the big difference is then we’ve had material that was originally characterized this waste, it’s now become ore, so that’s a good thing in terms of mineral model but it also results in lower stripping. So what we’d expected to be stripping is waste is now ore. That ore has a longer haul when and you’ve been out there, so taking it from the Northern pit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul, so that’s taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping. At Boddington, it’s been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape and that’s allowed us not just for this year but going forward to reduce some of the stripping. Twin Creeks, the question there was - now Chris Robison is going to address Twin Creeks’ question.
Chris Robison: Yeah John, I think it follows on with Gary commented on about Carlin in the longer hauls. The hauls right now at Twin are actually, well we continue to strip at a pretty high pace there. They are high in the mine, so pretty short hauls actually and we’ve done redesigns on where our dumps are and the hauls that of even shorten that more, so that’s probably the key to cause not up significantly as stripping continues.
John Bridges: Well, okay. And then maybe the longevity of how long you could delay some other stripping, how much flexibility you built into your mine plans?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, we’re really not delaying the stripping. This is both we modified the mine plan at Boddington and at Carlin it’s really a more a matter of the switch from ore to waste, so we’d be back into the normal sort of stripping going forward.
John Bridges: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot and well done guys.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you, John.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Walker with RBC. Your line is open.
Stephen Walker: Thank you very much. Thank you, Gary and team. Just a couple of questions Gary, if you could in previous calls there’s been more granular discussion on which projects, which smelting, copper smelting projects in Indonesia that you could be considering investing in as part of renewal process for the copper concentrate export progress here. I know it comes up for renewal in September, could you give us some color on your level of confidence that you get some news on that renewal of the copper concentrate export permit?
Gary Goldberg: Sure, thanks Steven. I think couple of things. Obviously, we continued to watch and see how Freeport progresses with their discussions because they are - I know the first cab of the rank with their permit do here this month are as due as you said in September. I met with a number of government officials earlier this year and more recently met with the Minister of Mines and Energy as he was here in the U.S. to just talk about the progress and where we are both in terms of the modifications to a contracted work and the permit extension. And we do continue to discuss with several parties the potential of participating in a smelter and supporting the country’s policy of having in country processing. Those were at different stages with different parties and I am not really have liberty to get into the details on those other than we continue to progress that. I do think there is desire in country that’s continued to see the operations run as we work together towards a solution. Now I have encouraged as I was when I visited in March and that resulted in getting our extension in March. We’ve got work to do and they are just coming out of a holiday period here primarily through the month of July and we’re looking to get reengaged in detail on these discussions in August with the government.
Stephen Walker: Great, just as follow-up on that too. You are going to be benefitting from the Phase 6 high grade, when do you have to make a decision on the pre-strip for the Phase 7 or and what are the metrics vis-à-vis gold and copper prices that makes at a go or no go or is it a forgoing conclusion that it is a go at this Phase 7 strip at this stage?
Gary Goldberg: No, Stephen, a good question, it’s one of the things in why we are encouraging getting resolution on the contractor work, so we know that we have the certainty in terms of how we’re going to look out in the future for development of Phase 7. Phase 7, we really get into larger spending for striping in particular early next year, so we’re really targeting through the end of this year, we’ll look at it. The same way we do with all of our different options at different price scenarios to see what it make sense, how it make sense to bring it forward, how it make sense to finance that particular investment because it’s about five years of striping, we’re doing work with the team there to look at ways to maybe reduce that a bit and improve the cost profile and how we can drive things. We’ve just got the full potential program rolled out there and we’re going to see how we can improve our cost position there as well. All that we want to factor in as we make the decision on whether and how to proceed with Phase 7.
Stephen Walker: Alright, I assume that’s not in the capital guidance, that’s been given looking forward?
Gary Goldberg: That’s not in the current capital guidance.
Stephen Walker: If I can change gears a little bit at Merian you are using an EPCM contractor G Corp, this is unusual when we look at what Newmont has done in the past, you’ve not - you’ve always done that sort of internally, can you discuss a little bit how that process is going and whether you think that you could be looking at using contractors or EPCM contractors of this nature going forward?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, no, good point. We have - sometimes we’ve done it internally. For larger projects we’ve actually done it with third parties, you the back goes in the flares and that type. G Mining has had a good history of building projects of this scale and particular in Suriname, Luis [ph] has done a good job there and continues to do a good job for us, so it’s a different model and it’s one that we believe allows us to build projects affectively safely and at a lower cost than what we’ve been seeing through some of the other model. So we’re giving it a bit of a try here how it might apply in other place. I think once you start to get much larger project in this, that model may not fit, but I think for the most of the projects we have in our project pipeline this sort of model is something that makes good sense. So that’s why we’re given in a try and as I said we’re seeing good progress there. We’re at 25% project completion year-to-date and that’s progressing very well on the ground.
Stephen Walker: Great, and just one last question Laurie, if I might ask, both gold and copper revenues were lower in the quarter than the average price in the quarter, is that just a timing issue on gold and copper concentrate sales?
Laurie Brlas: Definitely on the copper concentrate sale there is a bit of a timing issue. On a year-to-date basis I think we are pretty solid on gold and we see continuing to hit the numbers for the rest of the year. Copper will get back from that timing gap.
Stephen Walker: Or it should improve into the third into the third quarter just on a PP or prior period pricing adjustments?
Gary Goldberg: Yes.
Laurie Brlas: Yes, that CCR feeds well affect that and we also have mark-to-market adjustments more still again on the copper and gold.
Stephen Walker: Thank you, Gary. Thank you, Laurie.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Stephen.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Jorge Beristain: Hey good morning, everybody, Jorge Beristain of DB. I guess my first question is maybe for Laurie, just more of a technical accounting question. Your year-end ‘14 reserves stood at about 82 million ounces and 17 years of mine life, but that’s based on $1,300 gold. So I was wondering if you could provide any kind of sensitivity around where your reserves could go at current spot of around 1,100 and if you believe that from an accounting point of view, you are being sufficiently conservative enough using that $1,300 gold price in light of the recent move?
Laurie Brlas: Yeah, we will certainly evaluate that as we get towards the year-end. And as you know, we have to be at or below the three year trailing average by SEC requirement. We’ve historically been below that. But given what we’re seeing, you could see some kind of a change and we provided the sensitivity on that in the past what would happen, but we also in those sensitivities assume consistent are the dollar that what we saw a year ago. So I think you’d see some of that adjustment would be medicated. Gary, you want to add on that?
Gary Goldberg: No, I think we have in those reserve calculations, we left the Aussie dollar at parity dollar for dollar and the oil was at a $100 per barrel. So as we - we assess reserve reporting at the end of the year and making a potential reduction in that reserve price, we would include also those changes in the Aussie the oil price and also the improvements we’ve seen in our operating cost throughout the business.
Laurie Brlas: And that wouldn’t have a direct - an adjustment like that would not have a direct impact or impairment on the balance sheet. What you might see if we reduced our reserves would be a bit higher depreciation and amortization next year as that would imply some shorter mines but there been a direct impairment.
Jorge Beristain: Got it, thank you. And just Gary, my second question is a bit more of a strategic nature, but seeing last week’s aggressive pullback in some of the gold equities and it does seem like we’re seeing some sort of investor fatigue or and/or capitulation toward gold and by extension the gold equities. Could you comment us to what you are hearing at the board level not only at the Newmont board or maybe within the industry as to what the industries planning to do in order to stay relevant as an asset class toward institutional investors which require certain thresholds for market cap and liquidity and just in other in short is M&A potentially back on the burner in 2016 if we continue see gold prices say below a 1,100?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, I’ll make it clear that M&A isn’t that top end of our priority. We’re really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think as it’s been highlighted continuing to deliver the results that we say we’re going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses, the way to earn the creditability of shareholders. As an industry, I think we’ve got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we’ll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We’ve got others that I am sure will get challenged just by the nature of how they going to cross and gone after their cost, improvement and efficiencies. We’ve really focused over the last couple of year with our board and what can be done to sustainably improve and efficiencies not just do something that’s flushing the pan for a year or two. And I think that’s just as important from a shareholder standpoint look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting. We’re really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we’ve got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye shareholder returns as you saw with a divided that we believe we’re positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline and those of the sorts of things that we’ve been discussing and focusing on it. I think in terms of the market, I’ve always been saying keep an eye on both what’s happening with ETS and what’s happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out is unfortunately a bit of a negative surprise, but quite frankly there was an increase in gold reserves that China had. And the underlying fundamentals of demand in Chain for gold still remain strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China. So I think that’s good, I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that I would expect this price still but I think where things go actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rates finally moving. So the speculation stops and we move pass that stage will be important. But we’re in it to the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and down. And so we’re not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we’ve really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we’ve positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings.
Jorge Beristain: Okay, great, thank you. And I just wanted to reemphasis, when I said M&A I really meant consolidation in terms of sorted mergers of equals, but I’ll leave it there. Thanks very much.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Jorge.
Operator: Our next question is from David Haughton with CIBC. Your line is open.
David Haughton: Yes, good morning, Gary, Laurie. I am David Haughton from CIBC. Got a couple of operational questions for you, in your commentary Gary, you’d mentioned the watering programs at Batu Hijau have a potential full better grades going forward what nearly it down at the bottom of the higher grade portion that beating the dry season. Does the watering have a material improvement beyond the second and third quarter?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, I think as we looked at it and we have to see what happens with the rain as you point out. But we’re about 50 meters below where we expected to be in terms of water level in the pit and it’s spend because it’s been drier but we also installed an additional the watering pipeline to make sure if rain came more than expected we’re in a better position. So that’s all helped. That could help and that’s one of the things, we do our plans for ‘16 and ‘17 because we would have planned in ‘16 a period where we actually came out of the pit bottom and it could position us better, but that’s part of what well assess when we do our ‘16 plan.
David Haughton: Okay, and also as a throughput at Batu Hijau has been picking up quite well in the first and second quarter this year. Should we expect it to be at those sort of levels going forward?
Gary Goldberg: I think it’s a combination, as we’re in the lower part of the ore body, the higher grade - higher grade is also softer ore and higher recovery. So all those go together to really result in the better results.
David Haughton: Okay, just switching continents to Ahafo continue to get good cash cost results there but your guidance is quite a bit hard than what we’ve seen in the first half of this year. Are you expecting some higher costs in the second half of the year with potentially all graded higher strip or some other factors?
Gary Goldberg: The combination of two things, one would be grade is expected to drop in the second half of the year and we also expect to see some higher sustaining capital spend that will occur in the second half of the year.
David Haughton: Okay, and then the last one looking at Tanami exploration, do any of those exploration results, have any of them being factored into your thoughts on the expansion?
Gary Goldberg: No, at this stage we are basing the expansion completely on what we have in our reserve base not on the resource or on the rest of what I have just talked about.
David Haughton: Okay, but if you are going to have additional infrastructure on presumably better mobility of fleet et cetera that that could put you in good stead for accessing potentially these new portions of the ore body if they pan out?
Gary Goldberg: No, exactly, we’ve got existing infrastructure but also have potential options. When you recall, we had a shaft option for continuing to expand production there. That could become one that we consider and then there be other potential incremental expansions at the mill we could do depending on what we’d find. But right now, I want to keep the focus keep it stepwise on what’s the most logical mix that based on what we know.
David Haughton: Okay, thank you Gary.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks David.
Operator: Our final question is from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Michael Dudas: Yes, thank you and good morning, Gary, Laurie and team. First question made for Laurie, if you were to looking at 2017 cost guidance of 900 to 1,000, if you’re to mark-to-market energy in $4, is that what a bit of the range would be low end, high end or could that be very helpful of we have these type of metrics over the next couple of years?
Laurie Brlas: We’ve provided those sensitivities in the past and those are included in our materials that certainly we’ve used. The midpoint of our guidance would reflect the energy an $8 assumptions that we’ve got right now.
Michael Dudas: Okay, fair enough. Secondly, when you mentioned, Gary mentioned in his prepared remarks about or maybe you did about net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of target of one, could you just characterize how sensitive that is relative to gold price additional acquisitions, progress on the development project, is that a hard target, is there a timeframe that’s included there?
Laurie Brlas: No, it’s a general guideline and it’s not going to be sensitive to development essentially because that doesn’t affect EBITDA, we’ve got that factored in. It’s really the EBITDA will move, I want to make the point that it’s at a $1,200 gold because our EBITDA will obviously more if the gold price changes. And so if we’re at a one, that’s extremely conservative, if we’re at one at $1,200 and so it fells up a little bit at $1,100 number, but we’re still at a very confident investment grade position.
Michael Dudas: And I wanted to flush it out, thank you. My final question, Gary, I know you talked about some of the labor issues in Africa and in Australia, what - any sense in North America, is there attraction of labor, productivity, any issues on that front that coming ahead over the next 12 to 18 months?
Gary Goldberg: No, no real issues in North America, Peru and quite frankly Australia, we continue to see better labor availability which is evident in the much over turnover rates we’re seeing in our operations in West half. So I think that’s a key point one other things and I mentioned we just had the board in. We spent quite a bit of time with the board talking about talent, talking about succession and what we do to make sure we have a good strong talent pipeline throughout the business, so not just at headquarters but how does that look out into the operations, how does it look from the finance side back in across the region. So it’s one that we spend a lot of time on and it’s one we feel it’s important for us as we try to separate ourselves from the rest of the group.
Michael Dudas: Excellent, I appreciate that. Thank you, good luck, guys.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Michael.
Operator: And we do have one final question. Our final question is from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anita Soni: Hi. Just one question on Achim, I think this group what there was a little bit lighter than prior quarter, could you just elaborate on that?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, what we had Anita in the first quarter in particular but second quarter for the first two months April and May we had lower throughput as we run the power rationing before we got the rest of the gen sets the temporary gen sets in. So from June we are back at full capacity and that was really the big driver on the difference in mill throughput and we’d expect that as I mentioned, now that we have the additional power capacity to be achieving the more normal levels going forward.
Anita Soni: So the full capacity for the reminder of the year at this point?
Gary Goldberg: That’s correct.
Anita Soni: Alright, thank you very much.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks Anita.
Operator: Alright, we have no further question. I would now turn the meeting over back to Mr. Gary Goldberg.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks operator and thanks again everyone for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our team continues to drive stronger performance across the portfolio and the sector. We’ve remained committed to continually improving the business by making our operation safer and more efficient and to building a longer life, lower cost asset portfolio that thrives in all cycles. Our ultimate goal is to create the value in need to fund profitable growth, pay down debt and most importantly generate cash for our shareholders. Thank you for your time and have a safe day.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference. All lines may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc. Q1 2015 Results Conference Call for Thursday, April 30. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you, Melanie, and welcome to the Goldcorp first quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Project. For those who'll be participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this afternoon’s discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, that are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, and costs and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're coming to you from Toronto where we will be holding our Annual General Meeting this afternoon. I can't think of a more exciting time during my 10-year at Goldcorp and I look forward engaging with our shareholders on some of the things we're working on to sustain that excitement further into the future. On that bane I'm pleased to report that Goldcorp had a solid start to the year with record quarterly gold sales of 827,500 ounces generating very strong adjusted operating cash flow of $366 million. Gold production for the first quarter was approximately 725,000 ounces which as planned will be our lowest quarterly production for this year. Even with the slow starting point, we achieved lower than expected all-in sustaining costs of $885 per ounce. Adjusted revenues were $1.27 billion with adjusted net earnings of $12 million. These earnings do not reflect the strong cash flow generation in the quarter which managed the $366 million and Lindsay will walk you through that. Both Cerro Negro and Argentina and Éléonore in Canada have now declared commercial production. I'm particularly pleased with the start-up and performance during the quarter at Cerro Negro and it looks to be on track to meet all of our forecasts for the year. At Éléonore we worked through a few start-up challenges and the mine is now focused on resuming its ramp up. Peñasquito is on track for one of the strongest years of its mine life and the rest of the mine portfolio is operating as expected.  During the quarter, we also continued to proactively manage the mine portfolio. We completed the acquisition of probe mines and its high quality Borden gold project near Porcupine which will allow us to leverage our strong team and infrastructure in the area. We are already ramping up the drilling and work at Borden and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year. We also completed the divestiture of the Wharf Mine and we're in the process of divesting our interests in the South Arturo Project in Nevada.  This work is consistent with our long standing strategy of adding value creating new assets while divesting non-core assets along the way. We continue to focus on driving down our costs, the decrease in the first quarter all-in sustaining costs was driven by foreign exchange and lower sustaining capital as well as productivity and efficiency enhancements through our operating for excellence program. We expect to continue to see cost savings throughout 2015 and beyond. As we have discussed many times, sustaining capital tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of sustaining capital expenditures.  We are pleased to reconfirm gold production guidance this morning of between 3.3 million and 3.6 million ounces for the year. The first quarter production was expected to be low as the new mines Cerro Negro and Éléonore ramp up through the year and we mined higher grades at Peñasquito. For these reasons I'll advise again that our production was strongly weighted towards the second half of the year.  We're also reconfirming our all-in sustaining cost guidance which is expected to be between $875 and $950 per ounce and capital spending between $1.2 billion and 1.4 billion. DD&A remains at $390 per ounce and we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be 45% for the year, up from our previous guidance of 35% and Lindsay will discuss those details.  Turning to our five year production guidance, the priority remains on maximizing cash flow and our portfolio was positioned to generate free cash in each of the next five years at current metal prices. With our current suite of mine construction projects essentially complete, there's been growing curiosity about what comes next. Our each project included on this slide has the potential to be included in the next phase of Goldcorp's growth, but significant work remains to be done. Some are already close to fruition including the new hybrid gold production from Cochenour at Red Lake, as well as the important additions of the Hollinger and the Hoyle deep projects at Porcupine.  Two other projects that we recently discussed deserve special mention is each has the potential to significantly enhance the profiles of two of our largest mines, Peñasquito with the metallurgical enhancement project and Red Lake with the HG Young discovery and George will speak to about both of those in a moment.  Now we've tried here to provide some context around how organic opportunities may ultimately contribute to Goldcorp's future. This slide is not a forecast of what we expect to do, but simply characterizes the many different opportunities in front of us. All of these projects will be studied and prioritized and only those that meet our capital return requirements will go forward. And we'll also analyze external opportunities along the way and allocate capital where it generates the highest returns. So as I said it's a very exciting time, as we turn from inaugurating the new Éléonore and Cerro Negro mine to looking forward to the next stage in the long history of success at Red Lake with the completion of Cochenour, to the next generation of organic growth projects, we all remain very focused on delivering on our forecasts and meeting or exceeding newer expectations.  And with that I will turn it over to George.
George Burns: Thanks Chuck. Goldcorp's mines delivered safe first quarter gold production of approximately 725,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $885 per ounce. It’s a big ramp up here of our two new mines Cerro Negro and Éléonore and I continue to see our future taking shape. It’s an exciting time where we're seeing the strong foundation of existing mines intersect with the use and potential of our newer mines. I see innovation and technology making the difference, not just with these new mines but also revitalizing older operations. Our people have been energized by the opportunities before them and I look forward to nurturing these successes going forward. Beginning with our newest assets the Éléonore team overcame some startup challenges to position the mine for a strong ramp up over the remainder of 2015.  The tailings filter press issue that impacted the fourth quarter in January of 2015 has been resolved. We shut down the process plant in March for 13 days to ensure compliance with water effluent standards due to upset conditions from equipment damage by ice. This impacted production during the quarter; however the mill was well positioned to ramp up throughout the year. During this time mine development activities continued as planned and comfortable with our annual guidance at Éléonore.  At Cerro Negro the promise of this high grade ore body is now becoming a reality. The team turned in another strong operational quarter as we focused on line ramp up, which featured the successful mining in the first production [stopes] from the new high grade Mariana Central mine.  Moving to Peñasquito we had a very strong quarter as mining progresses in the higher grade portions of the pit. At Cochenour successful integration into Red Lake continues, with no feed expected from the [port stopes] in the third quarter of this year.  Turning to Éléonore with more detail, the first quarter production of total 332,500 ounces. Mining of ore took place from the first two main production horizons with the ore stock pile on surface increasing to 335,000 tons at the end of the first quarter. Production was lower than expected as discussed earlier. We are on track underground to bring two additional main production horizons online during the balance of the year. Our strong operating team and exceptional infrastructure continue to support the ramp up required to achieve guidance. Underground production shaft reached a depth of 1,140 meters below surface and sinking is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, with a shaft fully commission in the second half of 2016. The exploration ramp reached a depth of 887 meters. At Éléonore original plan left 110 meter crown pillar, only part of which would have been mine entering into the mine line. And we're now looking at alternative to accelerate mining to take out the entire crown pillar in the mine line. A pre-feasibility study is underway through evaluate that economics in this opportunity and expect to be completed by the end of this year. At Cerro Negro production for the first quarter total 93,600 ounces at all-in-sustaining cost of $704 per ounce. Commercial production was declared on January 1st and permanent power from the national grid on February 2nd. Sales during the quarter totaled the 160,500 ounces, which included 115,200 ounces from production in 2014. But that gain continued at the Eureka mine and commenced at the higher grade Mariana Central mine with the first two productions stopes mined during the quarter. Production was supplemented by the Eureka ore stockpile which is expected to be depleted by the middle of the year, not all of the ore will come directly from Eureka and Mariana Central mines. With the arrival of the additional underground mobile equipment and more miners continue training programs. Production rates are increasing as expected.  The mill is performing well and during March we average throughput of 3,560 tons per day. The coverage have been outstanding particularly for slow growth as we've improved the circuit with the addition of lead nitrate Cerro Negro continues to exhibit potential for strong reserve and resource growth in year ahead. During the quarter we continued our resource definitions dwelling program with the focus at Bajo Negro and Vein Zone targets. At Bajo Negro we have now defined a vertical continuity [aboard] that match with Mariana Central. At the Vein Zone which is originally conceived as an open pit, we're seeing some underground grades of debt, the deposit remains open and we're investigating the potential of a concurrent underground beneath the shallow pit.  Turning to Peñasquito our flag ship mine began here impressively. Gold production totaled 155,600 ounces at all-in-sustaining costs of $702 per ounce. Higher production was a result of entering the new pit phase and we expect to continue to see higher grades for the balance of the year. Construction of the Northern Well Field is progressing. We anticipate completion in mid-July; however negotiations are ongoing to secure surface rights to complete the final connection of the pipeline and further delays in obtaining access rates and the potential to delay the overall completion of the pipeline. We continue to work for the fair resolution and we are also evaluating other access alternatives. Contingency plans are in place for adequate fresh water supply to Pensaquito until the northern well field is operational.  The metallurgical enhancement project is combined with concentrating enrichment process and the private rich project entered feasibility study phase during the quarter and we expect to have it completed in early 2016. These projects continue to demonstrate overall enhanced economics and the potential for extension of mine life at Peñasquito. The results will be included in the new life of mine and it is currently underway.  At Camino Rojo ongoing feasibility work is focused on evaluation of Camino Rojo at the supplemental source of transition and sulphide ore to the existing Peñasquito facility. In addition to a small standalone outside reach operation. The completion of the pre-feasibility study is expected in 2016.  Turning to Red Lake. Safe gold production totaled 107,400 ounces while all in sustaining cost decreased to $799 per ounce. Production was affected by lower tonnages as we continue to phase out remnant mining in the Campbell Complex during the year.  Increased rates during the quarter were a result of improved work control, sequencing and a positive model of consolidation. At Cochenour exploration drilling continued to ramp up with 12 drills on sight and results to date consistent with expectations. Drilling commenced in the upper levels with two drills operating and several more platform ready for new [drills]. Preparations are nearing completion for drilling to commence in the hanging well of deposit to drill the deeper of portion of the deposits.  However excitement surrounding Red Lake is on the exploration front with the view HG Young discovery, exploration development to excess HG Young advanced north on the 14 level of the Campbell Complex following completion of rehabilitation of historic drips in the fourth quarter of 2015. The drip provides a new drill platform for follow up drilling on several significant intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program. This wide space surface drilling program is nearly complete and results will be use to find the footprint commencing over deposit which is looking very positive. Exploration drilling also continued on a number of other underground exploration projects, including the high grade zone. I'm pleased with the progress at Red lake and continue to expect that we will meet our guidance for the year. Overall the company is very focused on growing reserves for the year between the maiden reserve at Cochenour continuing growth at Éléonore and Cerro Negro and potential for the MAP project at Peñasquito we have many opportunities to meet our objectives. In closing a solid start to the year as Chuck said, we are all focused on executing our plans and delivering the performance that we have guided to the market. With that I'll turn the call over to Lindsay for the first quarter financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks George. With Cerro Negro declaring commercial production January 1, all sales for the first quarter and now that's a 827,500 ounces compared to sales of 708,000 ounces in the previous quarter. Effective January 1, proceeds from the sale of Cerro Negro metals have been recognized as revenues with expenditures incurred during production recognized as expenses. The excess gold sales over production during the quarter was primarily due to the gold ounces produced at Cerro Negro prior to January 1 which we then sold in the first quarter 2015. Also at Éléonore we declared commercial production April 1 to the 32,500 pre-initiating ounces produced at Éléonore are not reflected in gold sales revenues, more consolidate net earnings but rather the net proceeds are credited to the cost of building the mine. Total byproduct cash cost were $585 per gold ounce consistent with 589 in the prior quarter. We also realized an average full price $1,217 per ounce for the quarter. Adjusted net earnings totaled $12 million or $0.01 per share for the quarter compared to $55 million or $0.07 per share in the previous quarter. The decrease in adjusted net earnings was due primarily to the lower margin on gold that will slow the Cerro Negro in the first quarter but produced during commissioning in 2014. During the quarter we also saw higher depletion in depreciation expense with Cerro Negro and production and a higher effective tax rate due to higher taxes in Mexico. First quarter depreciation was $440 per ounce but it is expected to decline over the remainder of the year to our guided amount of $390 per ounce. Our reported net loss of $87 million or $0.11 per share translates into an adjusted net earnings of $12 million or $0.01 per share primarily due to the add back of foreign exchange losses. Further details reconcile the actual to adjusted net earnings are provided on page 38 of our MD&A.  Our effective tax rate on adjusted net earnings for the first quarter is 66%. The increase in the effect of tax rate was a result of non-deductible payments made and for foreign exchange losses incurred. The calculation of the effect of tax rate is up on the webcast to give you some [promise] of our calculation. Excluding impacts of foreign exchange on deferred third tax assets and liability the company now expects an annual effective tax rate of 45% in 2015 on adjusted net earnings, implying a 39% rate for the rest of the year. Turning to provisional pricing, we had a negative $0.4 million provisional pricing impact at Peñasquito and a negative $2 million at Alumbrera. The provisional sales at March 31 at Peñasquito includes 98,900 ounces of gold priced at $1,183 per ounce, 3.3 million ounces of silver at $16.62 per ounce, 53 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.94 per pound, and 24 million pounds of lead priced at $0.82 per pound. While at Alumbrera we have 19,800 ounces of gold priced at $1,188 per ounce and 19,019 million pounds of copper priced at $2.75 per pound. All-in sustaining costs for the first quarter were $885 per ounce compared to $1,035 per ounce in the prior quarter. The decrease is mainly due to higher gold sales volume and lower sustaining capital expenditures in the quarter. The company continued to generate strong adjusted cash flows from operations that amounted to $366 million or $0.45 per share compared to $337 million or $0.41 per share in the prior quarter. The improved adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter primarily resulted from the contributions in Cerro Negro for the first time after declaring commercial production January 1. We also invested $408 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid a $122 million of dividend this quarter. Sustaining capital expenditures were lower this quarter and will increase during the year while expansion capital of first quarter was higher due to economy 2014 capital in 2015. As part of our strategy to focus on full assets within our portfolio during the first quarter of 2015 with dispersive work and receive proceeds of $98 million. We also completed the acquisition of gold mine, which is reflected to be a new source and low cost, high quality gold production supporting plant.  Seeking new account of $410 million in cash and approximately $9.9 billion available on revolving credit facility, the company has a required liquidity to meet our future cash needs. With that I'll turn it back to your operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Not a pleasant question. First, I don't know how many times you've used the term pleased during the conference, but the facts are the facts. Over the last year your stock has fallen 25%. NECO is flat, Newmont is up. Your Company has not generated free cash in four years. You began a large capital spending program at precisely the wrong time. The balance sheet has gone from zero debt to $3.6 billion. Isn't it about time you started exploring options because just throw your hands up and say the shareholders have suffered enough here? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes let me address some of those comments, first the free cash flow was found quite knowingly and with full disclosure to the market that we had embarked on spending to build the Cerro Negro and Éléonore projects. These things take three four years to do after a lot of planning and one can't anticipate what the gold price is going to do and you can't just turn these things on and off in the mix of our construction activities. And so we are quite pleased that we continued with those we have the balance sheet to do it, we have a debt level now that is near the lowest of any in our sector and have the only BBB plus rated balance sheet in the business. So certainly the balance sheet is quite strong. When you look at the share price performance we absolutely recognize that we did not meet our guidance for 2014 and that put us in a the penalty box. We said that we would make a certain numbers of ounces and we didn’t. We had problems at our El Sauzal mine and our Los Filos mine and that put us off on our guidance and we have been punished with that in the share price and rightly so. We are absolutely committed to making sure that we meet our forecast this year and we will. So I think that the company is absolutely well suited for success going forward and I had also point out that if you look at that share price over two years, over three years, over five years over 10 years we've outperformed nearly everyone in this space. So I expect to get back to that kind of performances as we deliver on our forecast this year.
Operator: The following quarter is from Patrick Chidley from HSBC. Please go ahead. 
Patrick Chidley : Hi, Chuck, everybody. Just a quick question on Cerro Negro. In terms of the amount of gold that was brought from Q4 into Q1, what impact would you say that had on costs? Was the production in Q4, for example, a lot higher cost than, say, would have been Q1? And going forward, how would you see the trajectory for costs at Cerro Negro? The question is really aimed at how much is because of the startup issues in terms of why the costs were higher than what we had expected I guess? And also going forward, do you expect that to come down I guess? 
Lindsay Hall: As you know that we had something of the order of 115,000 of ounces of inventory at Cerro Negro at the end of 2014 and certainly sold that in the first quarter goes out since that higher the inventory of those ounces have higher cost because of the commissioning period. But we actually obviously sold both during the first quarter. So that to our cost in the first quarter will go away in the remaining quarters as we're adding new production at the new cost rather than inventory being sold that had pre-commissioning cost attached to it.
Chuck Jeannes : I would just add that with the end start up, you should expect to see higher costs in the beginning because we got a lot of fixed cost that were amortizing over few number of ounces. And as we build those ounces up over the course of the year you should see that per ounce cost come down. But don't expect to see from the very beginning a cost that would be equivalent to what you expect for the average of the mine once it's up and running at a full speed. 
Patrick Chidley : Right of course I was just curious as to what the impact might be for Q4 and where you're really commissioning on Q2 which is nearly up to full production on the mill there. 
Chuck Jeannes : No not quite and certainly not on the mines George you can talk about the tonnage ramp up both in the mines. 
George Burns : Sure so the mill main phase 4,000 tons a day and we've been feeding low grade stockpile that will be completed by the middle over year and essentially the mine will determine the mill throughput. They are ramping up the mine and will be in that 3,600 ton a day range for the balance of the year.
Patrick Chidley : And then just another question just on working capital move strong I guess you had a lot of payments to working capital in Q1 here. Could you explain what specifically that was all about? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes Patrick what it was is that, the concentrate that we're producing and produce at Peñasquito in the fourth quarter 2014 put that on a boat, give it to a smelter in the first quarter and while it's on the boat, I don't get paid so it's just delay in the receipt of the amount of shipments made at the tail end of 2014 to the smelters so, those funds, that was about $150 million all coming in the second quarter as normal.
Operator: Thank you, the following question is from Josh Wilson from Dundee Capital Markets, please go ahead.
Josh Wilson: Hey. A couple questions on some of the cash items. I guess talking about that working capital, in addition to the accounts receivable that I guess increased, accounts payable decrease, should we expect that to stay at this level or is there going to be a reversal as well for that going forward?
Lindsay Hall : Yes, with some of the tax payments probably relate to tax draw -- this is Lindsay speaking. Those bounce around a bit, I think if there's something different it gets lumpy in the working capital that you and I are talking about. It’s really the timing of receipt of the concentrate payments and then it's just overly large shipments made at the tail end of 2014 but it should reverse obviously over the course of the year with the capital.
Josh Wilson: Okay. And then two other questions on sort of cash items, like I mentioned. On Pueblo Viejo I think there was discussion this year about dividends expected to be received. We didn't see anything come in the first quarter. Is it just -- I guess what's the reason for that? 
Chuck Jeannes: Well we did receive 37 million of cash from PV so it is while you call it a dividend its return of interest and a portion of our shareholder loans into the project, but we actually got 37 million during the quarter, I think it was cash obviously. 
Josh Wilson: Okay. I'm looking at Note 12 in the financials that says Pueblo Viejo dividends from associates, zero. 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, but we put our monies in two ways, gross to shareholder loans and to capital and what I'm saying I guess that 37 million payment on my interest due on my shareholder loans which is a form of repayment of funds out of PV for the first time, but it's not considered a dividend because we didn't come back on the capital.
Josh Wilson: Okay. And in terms of where that would be registered on the cash flow statement, is there a different category or --? 
Unidentified Company Representative: I think that in the financial statements it's probably in the accounting for the equity accounting of the associates return on that capital.
Josh Wilson: And then lastly on sort of the CapEx front there was a pretty significant accrual. You guys paid a lot more capital this quarter out than I guess the site level numbers once again. Is that something you expect to sort of stabilize going forward or are there still payments to be made or payments I guess that will be lower in the future? 
Chuck Jeannes: No, pure timing over 2014 over to the first quarter 2015, basically to do with this new capital project, Éléonore and Cerro Negro but that's just timing over quarter end so actually we're happy with the guidance and that will pull us way through the rest of the year so they will not continue at that level.
Josh Wilson: Okay. And then when we look at things like the capital expenditure guidance, is that site level or is that actual cash flow statement items? 
Chuck Jeannes: That's cash flow.
Operator: Thank you, the following question is from John Tumasoz from John Tumasoz Very Independent Research, please go ahead.
John Tumasoz: Thank you. I had another question on working capital which has been answered. 
Chuck Jeannes: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you, the following question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
Jorge Beristain: Hey, guys. As I flagged in my note earlier, the change in the balance sheet position was concerning to me and while we appreciate you've had a historically a leading dividend policy in the sector, I'm just wondering about the sanctity of that in light of what seems to be a bit of a balance sheet blow of late and if you could just talk to how sustainable you believe the dividend is? 
Chuck Jeannes: I think Lindsay could talk to the balance sheet and a big part of the need to take down bit more on the revolver, was that working, yes, on the move that he just described and we had a negative 245 million during this quarter and that will reverse, certainly that is with a sustained number. With respect of the larger issue on the dividend as you mentioned we do pay a dividend that is certainly the highest in the sector and as we completed the construction of these sites and you can see it on the balance sheet we've gotten kind of down to the bottom of the barrel in terms of our cash proceeds and so it's been more difficult I would say to continue paying it but we have and we have no intention of changing that in the immediate future but it's one thing that we always say that we look at as a lever to pull as one of the ways that we will look to finance new growth opportunities in the company, so I just have to say, you know watch in the future and see what might happen there.
Jorge Beristain: Chuck, if I could just have maybe a second and obviously I think earlier speaker expressed some concern about the CapEx and kind of what that's led to, but just very rough numbers. It seems like you've deployed about $9 billion of CapEx over the past four years and rough numbers I think about third of that was equity funded and about another two-thirds was funded by the kind of radical change you've seen in your net debt balance sheet over the period, but I was just wondering if you could talk about how you measure the incremental returns on capital that that spending has generated, I guess maybe isolating the gold price, because I'm just not sure how investors would benefit from that kind of CapEx cycle which has been I guess now equivalent to almost half your current market cap. And just wondering how you guys internally measure that you're doing a good job in terms of return on capital? 
Chuck Jeannes: Well its great question [Jorge] and the key to what you just said is isolating for the gold price. I mean certainly when you starting building at Éléonore and at Cerro Negro at a much higher price environment you have an expectation of stronger returns. And you know very well what happened down in Argentina in terms of the financial situation down there which ended up running the capital expenditures up much higher than planned and so we had a strategic decision to make partway through the construction of Cerro Negro as to whether to continue doing that or to try to mothball and put it on care maintenance and wait for better times. And we decided that it is a very long term asset with a lot of opportunity for extended mine life and growth and so that we will kind of model through the current financial situation and get to a point where I think overtime that would be a great return to our shareholders.  But if you go back and as you said not sure how you isolate the gold price because you have to go back and say while we wouldn’t have made decisions we did because the gold prices are at a different level and the Argentine Peso was a different level and if you correct for those things and we've only made investment decisions that provided returns well in excess of our cost of capital. So at this point we just spend that money the job now is to apply all of our efforts through operating excellence and the other programs that we have to try to enhance the returns as the best we can. And we think that Éléonore, Cerro Negro and Cochenour are going to be fantastic assets for a long time. So Lindsay wants to talk a bit just for the balance sheet. So let me pass it.
Lindsay Hall : Yes Jorge, you will admit that we're pretty comfortable with our balance sheet after drilling those mines and are very comfortable with the balance sheet and if you look at the result of drilling those mines. We also have an increasing production profile and a platform price so rather would been from a CFO point of view I rather be at that position today than not building those mines and completing building the mines which we have done today.
Operator: The following question is from Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Quail : Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I've got an easy one and just another one that is triggered by all the talk previously. One is on Eleonore. Do we sort of see -- this is in regards to grade as we head into sort of the second half of 2015. Do we get up to reserve grade by the end of the year? 
George Burns : So the Éléonore grade is going to increase throughout the year in kind of [gen grade]. In terms of grade Éléonore or body is higher graded debt as you know we're mining in a horizon two and three. And the fourth quarter we'll be mining at horizon four where we have higher grades and that will be pushing up our average rates for the year. We are going to be nearing 7,000 per ton in the fourth quarter to give you an idea how grades M&A.
Andrew Quail : Thanks, George. That's what I was looking for. To follow up on the previous questions. I don't really agree with what they were saying, but as you guys go into a different part of your life, I suppose, and you are over the CapEx hump and you have been I'd say proactive on divesting some other assets like Mariana, Wharf, Chuck do you think there's other assets in the portfolio as we've seen other guys large cap gold companies around the world do, do you see there's sort of other opportunities to optimize the portfolio in 2015?
Chuck Jeannes: Well let me say one thing on a more general basis is that I think there is a big difference selling assets because you need to pay down debt versus selling assets as a regular part of ongoing year after year portfolio management so that we upgrade the overall file of our portfolio by adding fresh new young long life mines and disposing off non-core assets along the way. So this has been something that we've been doing from many, many years back to the disposal of the peak [indiscernible] mines San Dimas and Marigold and Wharf that's certainly nothing new is not the flavor of the month for us.  And then on a more specific basis, I never talk about disposal of assets because we think tend to be opportunistic, we've been very active in this regard while and I don't see any need to certainly look for disposing of anything and all I can tell you is that we'll continue to actively manage our portfolio going forward but -- I wouldn't look for anything imminent there.
Operator: Thank you. The following is from Tony Lesiak of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Tony Lesiak: Question for George. We haven't seen the favorable currency impacts on unit cost in the Canadian ops. I guess some of it should be short lived, you had some ground issues. Maybe you can give us a sense of how we should see the unit costs move in Q2 and maybe over the remainder of the year.
George Burns: You're talking specifically in the Canadian region?
Tony Lesiak: Yes, I mean just looking at Red Lake, Musselwhite, Porcupine and the unit costs seem to be trending higher.
George Burns: Yes, I mean, I think if you look at our overall production in the first quarter it's low relative to the average for the year and so yes we're going to see those unit costs come down as the production -- consolidated production for the region ramps up.
Tony Lesiak: Okay. Can you give me a sense of how quickly and how much?
George Burns: I mean, we don't guide by mine by quarter. I can tell you, I'm comfortable if we're going to get an overall guidance on all-in-sustaining cost for the year and even if you're improving cost and it's maybe quarter over quarter. 
Tony Lesiak: And for Lindsay, maybe I missed it, the answer to Patrick's question on the cost associated with the inventory. 
Lindsay Hall: No, we didn't Tony. We just had, obviously the inventory at December 31, 2014 were higher and that went through the P&L in the first quarter but -- we certainly have sold that inventory and the new inventory that's being produced will be sold at a lower cost. 
Tony Lesiak: Okay. Was there margin on that -- on those sales?
George Burns: Yes. There is some but very little because they were in the commissioning phase. So the costs were loaded up on those ounces, so very little margin.
Operator: The following question is from Carey MacRury of TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Carey MacRury: Good morning, guys. Just a question on depreciation. I think for the quarter it was something like $445 an ounce versus your guidance which I believe is around $390. So just a question of why it was so high in Q1? And secondly on Cerro Negro specifically, I think it worked out to $650 an ounce for the quarter. Is that a level that we should use in the near future? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, Cerro Negro would be around at that level and I think to be safe same for the first quarter as we saw a lot of -- obviously DD&As on sale so we saw a lot of sales at Cerro Negro in the first quarter and that mix of sales throughout the rest of the year is going to -- when I say mix we're going to have less of a proportion in Cerro Negro sales over the rest of the year and what will happen -- while we're comfortable with our guidance going from what is seemingly a pretty high guidance from the first quarter declining down to our 390 per year, bemuse we see the benefits of Peñasquito Steve, and we also see a couple of things too, small things, it'll be more of that mix in the next three quarters but also we think that Marlin and Alumbrera will come down over the next three quarters as well so that's why we're comfortable but Cerro Negro's kind of at that level, but it was a big mix of sales for the first quarter.
George Burns : And if I could just add, the benefit of a place like Cerro Negro, I guess the bad part is we start off with a high DD&A per ounce but we also have a lot of opportunity to add reserves there over the years which will bring down that number over time so we've got the drills turning and fully expect to add reserves as we go forward at Cerro Negro.
Operator: Thank you, the following question is from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank, please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek: Hi. This is a question for Lindsay. Just, Lindsay, coming back to the balance sheet. Just looking at the cash level and assuming the same gold price or spot gold price today, do you see this as the bottom in your cash position? And as you get the inventory in Q2, the $300 million that you borrowed in the quarter, are we looking to repay that back, so basically what are we looking for the debt to do during this year?
Lindsay Hall : Hi, this is high scoring on the revolver, Tanya you're right as the receivables are on the Peñasquito concentrate of receipt, I expect that revolver to decline throughout the rest of the year and we will pay it back.
Tanya Jakusconek: What's the target for this year for repayment on the revolver?
Lindsay Hall : Assuming spot prices and assuming a lot of guidance I think certainly I would be hoping that I could bring that $300 million draw that we made in the first quarter down to back to maybe between zero and a 100, so I'd for sure pay back the 200 million, somewhere between a 100 and 0 number might be the result, seeing that we didn’t contemplate necessarily when we closed the probe acquisition we had come with $39 to buy those shares to start the transaction as you know we used the company shares to make the major acquisitions. But there was 39 million of cost outflows so that was some of the things that were -- maybe we didn’t contemplate that right off the start when we budgeted the year but this is the highest scoring part of the quarter obviously or the year of course for this quarter.
Tanya Jakusconek: You do you have a target then, Lindsay, at year end, your debt target? 
Lindsay Hall : Yes well obviously when you look at the balance sheet Tanya, you have very little as we would long term debt 2.5 billion. We also have some new payments obviously on the [indiscernible] debt we pay down and actually pay down. So I think it's our revolver at 1,140 today I would target around 700, 800 by the end of the year and then we have to just look at what that [indiscernible] to actually finance working capital and we're always looking at ways of financing the company, but it have a very low actual debt to cap structure already so we can afford more debt but we choose not to do that actually.
Tanya Jakusconek: So, I guess the bottom line is any free cash flow that starts to be generated from now Eleonore being commercial and obviously Cerro Negro will still continue to have high depreciation but free cash flow, that will go priority to paying down the revolver? 
Lindsay Hall : Yes that’s the case and I don’t think nearly can't forget as going to be just said we're also paying down the Pueblo Viejo debt. That’s not is obvious because it's coming down at the same time.
Operator: There are no further questions registered at this time. Please go ahead with your comments.
Jeff Wilhoit: Okay, thanks very much and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to updating to you on our progress as we continue to execute at the new mines and drive towards that free cash flow that we just talked about as the year progress. We will be starting our AGM webcast 3 PM so please join in or drop by the shares in center hotel here in Toronto. Thank you bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-20 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Meredith Bandy - VP of IR Gary Goldberg - President & CEO Laurie Brlas - EVP & CFO
Analysts: John Bridges - JPMorgan Patrick Chidley - HSBC Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank Adam Graf - Cowen Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Misha Levental - Cowen
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for question and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn conference over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Meredith Bandy: Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our Executive Team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Before I go any further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here, or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website, www.Newmont.com. Now I'll turn it over to Gary.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you, Meredith, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we made great progress delivering on our plans in 2014. Specifically, we significantly improved our safety, cost, and productivity performance, while achieving our production plans. We raised nearly $800 million by selling non-core assets, and began construction on our new mine in Surinam. We optimized our project pipeline to create a suite of near-term opportunities for profitable growth in Nevada, Ghana, and Australia. Finally, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet while generating value for our shareholders. I'll turn to Slide 4 to review more details. Strong safety performance is essential to running an efficient business. In 2014, we reduced our injury rates another 17% to historic lows, ending the year with one of the lowest rates in the mining industry. Our people are recognized for their leadership in this area. Most recently, our team at Waihi took first place in the New Zealand mine's rescue competition, and at Akyem they received the Best Safe Mine in Ghana Award. As proud as we are of these accomplishments, we still have work to do to make Newmont a safer business. We mourn the loss of Brian Holmes, a contractor who died in January while working at our Leeville operations in Nevada. Our thoughts are with his family, as we renew our commitment to eliminating all injuries at Newmont. Turning to Slide 5, I'll focus on our performance in each of the 3 pillars of our strategy. The first part of our strategy is to improve our underlying business. During 2014, we lowered our all-in sustaining costs by more than $500 million, or more than $100 per ounce, and met our plans to produce more than 4.8 million ounces of gold. We also kept our all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 an ounce for the second quarter in a row. The second part of our strategy is to strengthen our gold portfolio. During 2014, we made significant progress on our Turf Vent Shaft in Nevada, and broke ground on our new mine in Surinam, both of which will add lower cost production in stable jurisdictions. We also continued to optimize our project pipeline, and I'll talk more about that later in the call. Finally, we streamlined our portfolio by selling assets that no longer fit our strategy of operating low cost, long-life mines, and as a result have generated $1.4 billion over the past 2 years. The third part of our strategy is to generate value for our shareholders while improving financial flexibility and balance sheet strength. During 2014, we generated $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $341 million in free cash flow, an improvement of nearly $700 million over 2013. At the end of the year, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet, a 50% improvement from 2013. We also made an early payment of $100 million toward our existing term loan, and returned $114 million in dividends to our shareholders during the year. Summing up our 2014 performance, we remain focused on our strategic priorities while controlling what we could control, and ended the year with a much stronger and healthier business as a result. Turning to Slide 6, and a look at our 2014 production. You will recall that we sold Midas, Jundee, and La Herradura in 2014. Absent the impact of these divestments, our 2014 gold production was in line with our 2013 levels, and we are positioned to deliver steady gold production over the next several years, as well. I'll discuss this more when we review our guidance. We increased our gold production outlook twice in 2014, and finished the year near the top end of our original guidance, even without adjusting for divestments. Our priority is still to deliver value over volume, and I'll turn to our cost performance on Slide 7. You can see the progress we have made over the last 3 years, lowering our all-in sustaining costs by 15% since 2012. In 2014, we improved our gold all-in sustaining cost guidance twice as a result of steadily exceeding our savings targets. We finished the year 2% below the bottom of our final published range, and 10% below our 2013 costs. This adds up to more than $500 million in adjusted savings, as we see on Slide 8. We want to provide a clear view of our cost savings from 2013 to 2014, and to demonstrate how much of that amount resulted from improved technical and operational fundamentals. Our consolidated all-in sustaining cost decreased by $1.2 billion from 2013 to 2014. Of that decrease, $243 million was the result of portfolio changes, including divestments, the Akyem startup, and the four-month shut-down of Batu Hijau due to the export issues. A further $50 million was related to favorable oil and exchange rate movements. Finally, we took out $386 million related to inventory valuation changes. After excluding these items, we generated savings of $524 million in 2014. Let's turn to the main components of those savings on Slide 9. As you can see, more than half of Newmont's savings stem from improvements to our costs applicable to sales, which we reduced by almost 6% compared to 2013. I'll point out that this is the first time we've reduced our cost applicable to sales since 2009. We also stabilized our sustaining capital spend at lower and sustainable levels. Some of the work we did to achieve these operational improvements included reducing truck cycle times and improving payloads at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Yanacocha and Tanami, realigning mining and milling rates at Ahafo, reducing supplier and contractor costs by self-performing mining and maintenance activities, and negotiating better rates at Boddington, Carlin, and our operations in Ghana, and improving equipment reliability and tire life at Ahafo, Boddington, Twin Creeks, and Yanacocha. Another 23% of our savings came from lowering advanced projects and exploration costs by 27% to focus on our highest-margin opportunities. Finally, we lowered general and administrative costs across the portfolio. Turning to our exploration efforts, our latest reserves and resources statement reflects our ongoing focus on value and quality, as summarized on Slide 10. We added 3.3 million ounces to our gold reserve base last year, partially offsetting 5.5 million ounces of depletion. Our total gold reserves decreased from 88.4 million ounces in 2013 to 82.2 million ounces as of the end of 2014. About 40% of our net year-over-year reduction, or 2.5 million ounces, was associated with divesting non-core assets. Another 25%, or 1.5 million ounces, was due to model revisions and mine design changes, primarily at Turquoise Ridge and Boddington. Our most significant gold reserve additions were made near existing operations in favorable jurisdictions. These include about 700,000 ounces each at Tanami and the Carlin underground mines, 300,000 ounces at Waihi, and 200,000 ounces at Long Canyon. We also had notable additions at Merian. Turning to Slide 11, we added almost 600,000 ounces of gold reserves at Merian in 2014, half of which is soft saprolite ore, bringing our total reserves to 4.8 million ounces on a 100% basis. As you know, the government of Surinam invested just over $100 million in a 25% stake in Merian late last year. The government is managing its interest through its state-owned oil company, which has been operating in-country for 33 years, and brings a wealth of development experience to the partnership. I visited Surinam in December to meet our new partners and to visit the team. We are making good progress on all fronts. About 900 people are trained and working. Earth works are advancing well, and community agreements and environmental controls are in place. The project remains on budget and on schedule to begin production in late 2016. Before I hand it over to Laurie to talk about our financial performance, I also want to touch briefly on Indonesia and Ghana. You'll recall that PTNNT received a 6-month export permit late last September. We're very proud of the team's performance in executing a safe and efficient ramp-up to full capacity at Batu Hijau in October. The mine is just getting into the higher-grade portion of the ore body now. The new Indonesian administration is getting settled, and our initial meetings to renew our export permit and contractor work have been constructive. I'll keep you informed as we work through the details. Turning to Ghana, in late January the government imposed load-shedding requirements on all businesses. We are in discussions with the government, along with other large companies, to explore power-conservation alternatives that minimize disruptions to our operations. Our team is also developing contingency plans to maintain steady power generation through other sources, and I'll keep you posted on our progress. With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results.
Laurie Brlas: Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It was a strong quarter and year for Newmont, as our focus on cost and efficiency improvements continues to pay off. Let's turn to Slide 13 to review recent financial highlights. We worked hard to drive down cost in 2014, and the results speak for themselves. Fourth-quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce was down 18% from a year ago, and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce was down nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. The global cost reductions we achieved in 2014 helped us to expand free cash flow generation, despite a 10% drop in the gold price year over year. Turning to Slide 14, we delivered $218 million in consolidated free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2014, and generated a 46% improvement in cash from continuing operations compared to the year-ago quarter, despite the 10% drop in gold price. We reported adjusted net income of $86 million in the most recent quarter, or $0.17 per share, compared to $143 million, or $0.28 per share last year. We added adjusted EBITDA to our release this quarter, and are including it in our performance metrics going forward. I am pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA was up 26% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower cost applicable to sales, lower exploration and advanced projects expense, and lower stockpile adjustments compared to Q4 of 2013. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and earlier this week our Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share, in line with our gold price linked dividend. Turning to Slide 15, let's walk through Q4 net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $23-million gain net of tax related to the sale of La Herradura; a $10-million reclamation settlement; a $14-million impairment, primarily on our marketable securities; and a $43-million tax valuation allowance, of which $32 million was related to asset sales. Adjusted net income also excludes a $24-million loss from discontinued operations. This is a non-cash, marked-to-market adjustment to a royalty obligation. After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $86 million, or $0.17 per share, for the most recent quarter. Now turning to Slide 16. In 2014, we strengthened our balance sheet with increased cash from operations, and almost $800 million in net proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. At the end of the fourth quarter, our investment-grade balance sheet had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, a $3-billion revolver that is essentially undrawn, and $250 million in marketable securities. That's total liquidity of nearly $6 billion that Newmont can mobilize to invest in our projects, repay debt, or return cash to our shareholders. Slide 17 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities and potential pre-payments. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019, and have maintained an investment-grade rating and metrics. Our revolver has just one financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5%. We stood at 24.7% as of December 31. Our net debt at year end was approximately $4 billion. We continue to analyze potential opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance, as we did last quarter when we made a $100-million payment on our term loan. The term loan has no pre-payment penalty, and allows us to pre-pay near-term maturities first, so it's a preferred way to de-lever the balance sheet. We plan to potentially repay $750 million in 2015. That would include our PTNNT project debt, as well as additional payments toward our 2019 term loan. Certainly any pre-payment of debt would be analyzed in the context of the Company's cash position, operating performance, and business environment. However, even assuming lower gold prices, we have adequate financial flexibility to repay more than the $166 million of scheduled 2015 debt payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Gary.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Laurie. Now I'll walk you through our near-term outlook, which features steady and profitable production, ongoing cost and efficiency improvements, and stable sustaining capital expenditures, turning you to Slide 19. We expect to produce between 4.6 and 4.9 million ounces of gold in 2015, rising to between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces by 2017. In North America, we expect gold production to increase slightly over the 3-year period, as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, and enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin. Potential development of Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside, and I'll talk about that shortly. We're managing our Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesian assets as a single Asia-Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau, we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher-grade Phase 6 ore, and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami. In Africa, we expect production to decline, primarily due to lower-grade ore at Ahafo. However, a potential Ahafo Mill expansion would help offset the impact of lower grades, and I'll touch on that. In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017, as new production at Merian offsets the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits to extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance calls for continuous improvement in costs, as well. Turning to Slide 20, in 2015 we expect our gold all-in sustaining costs to come in between $960 and $1,020 per ounce, in line with our 2014 performance. By 2017, our gold all-in sustaining costs are expected to range from $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our over-arching goal is to keep all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce at each of our operations through ongoing cost and efficiency improvements. Our costs could further benefit from lower energy prices and improving foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 to the US dollar, and oil at $75 per barrel. We have contingency plans in place to ensure that we remain free cash flow positive if there are further fluctuations in metal prices. We are also holding the line on sustaining capital, turning you to Slide 21. Over the last few years, we've improved our capital discipline through a stringent value-assurance program that I've discussed before, and achieving sustainable savings through ongoing improvement initiatives. Looking forward, our outlook calls for holding our sustaining capital costs at between $850 million and $950 million from 2015 through 2017. Note that only our fully funded projects, the Turf Vent Shaft, Merian, and Correnso are included in our outlook, but we are planning to reach decisions on other projects as the year continues. I'll walk you through some of our most prospective projects now on Slide 22. We improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over the last year. Our projects focus on extending mine life, improving our cost portfolio, or opening prospective new mining districts. I'll take a minute to update you on those that are in the execution phase, and those that will come up for funding consideration in 2015. Turning to Slide 23. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft reached its full depth of just over 2,000 feet during the fourth quarter of 2014. The shaft will increase high-grade ore to Mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually, while improving costs and efficiency. We expect to be fully operational later this year. As I mentioned, construction at Merian is progressing on budget and on schedule. The mine is expected to be operational in late 2016, and will deliver gold production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first 5 years of operation, excluding escalation. As a reminder, our share of this project is 75%. Finally, in New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operation through our new Correnso mine, and will achieve commercial production during this first quarter of 2015. In addition to adding near-term ounces, Correnso provides a drilling platform to explore for other high-grade veins. Turning to Slide 24 and the next projects we will consider developing in 2015. Long Canyon represents a new high-potential mining district in Nevada, and we are approaching development as an extension of existing operations, in order to leverage our expertise and the infrastructure. The project has been optimized to lower capital, generate stronger returns, and reduce the pay-back period. We expect to reach a decision to proceed with the first phase of development at an investment of between $250 million and $300 million in the first quarter of 2015. The project would add between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold annually at competitive costs beginning in early 2017. In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami Expansion project, which includes constructing a second decline in the mine, and building incremental capacity in the plant. We anticipate reaching a decision on investing between $100 million and $120 million to fund this project in the first half of 2015. The Tanami expansion project would add between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces of lower-cost production beginning in 2017, and increase mine life by 4 years. In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion in the existing Ahafo Mill, which would help offset the impact of lower-grade ore. We anticipate reaching a decision on the mill expansion later this year, and see the potential to bring on 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive cost beginning in 2017. I'll wrap up my comments with a look at where we are taking the Company in the future, turning to Slide 25. We advanced our strategy to create a more focused and profitable gold mining business in 2014, and made substantial progress toward our goal to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. Our performance is the result of more than 13,700 employees delivering on their commitments. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our team for a job well done. Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy, which is to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost, and technical performance; to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer-life, lower-cost asset base; and finally to create shareholder value by generating cash, and continuing to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In short, we're not aiming to be a better gold Company. We're aiming to be the best. Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back to the operator now to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Bridges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Bridges: Good morning, Gary. Congratulations on the results.
Gary Goldberg: Good morning, John.
John Bridges: Just wondered - I know you can't say very much about Indonesia, but if you can remind us what it is you're negotiating. Your Freeport is doing the contract and the smelter. You're just talking about the contract, is that right?
Gary Goldberg: Yes, we have the extension of our export permit, which comes due the middle of next month, and those are 6-month export permits. That's the first item that we're looking to get as that extended. The second thing, we agreed last year in September to a memorandum of understanding essentially to 6 elements of our contractor work that we would agree to change. Some of those have actually gone into effect, some changes in royalty rates and duties. The rest are - there's changes to the size of the contractor work, those sorts of things. In with that is how we would participate in a smelter. Our position has continued to be that we would support smelter development from the standpoint of providing concentrate to that smelter and looking at that being done on terms that are international economic terms. I'm encouraged by where we are at today in those discussions, and look forward to working with this new administration to come to a clear solution going forward that fits for us and for the country.
John Bridges: Are you in parallel conversations with other people about building a smelter?
Gary Goldberg: We've had discussions clearly with Freeport and with other parties about building a smelter and participating in that.
John Bridges: Okay. As a follow-up, the Ghana costs in 2017 get quite chunky. Could you give us some color on that? Was that the power issue that took the prices so high?
Gary Goldberg: No, what we have, John, is the grades at Ahafo start to drop off, and in this plan we've not included any economics from an Ahafo Mill expansion. What you see is the grade coming down and strip ratio going up in Ghana - or in Ahafo by the end of 2017. The Ahafo Mill expansion would be one of our options to help offset that.
John Bridges: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Well done on the results. Thanks a lot.
Gary Goldberg: Great. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from a Patrick Chidley with HSBC.
Patrick Chidley: Good morning. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, following up on Ghana. No mention really of Subika. I'm wondering, that's obviously a potential source of high grade. Is that not a potential offset, or is there - is it just not a project that you're that advanced on?
Gary Goldberg: No, Subika is still on the list. In fact, as you see it, we've got right now - and it's been a bit of a competition between the mill expansion and the Subika underground as to which one is in a position to be considered to be brought forward first. It still is on our development pipeline, and it does add to grade. Of course, it's at a bit higher cost, being underground, but it's still a viable project alternative for us. That one would be probably later into 2015, early 2016 for consideration.
Patrick Chidley: Okay, thanks. Then thanks for laying out those projects for us that you've got, quite a few advanced projects. Just wanted to get a view on what rate of return you've considered for these projects, and what gold price you would have assumed?
Gary Goldberg: We use - actually, we test all of our projects against a variety of different price assumptions, but clearly take current spot, look out flat without any increase, and then we look at cases both above and below that. In terms of rates of return, we're looking to exceed our cost of capital, plus cover any sort of risk premium that we put on in the different regions. For instance, the project at Merian, we have a project there that we see - especially with some of the additional reserves that have now been added in, a project that has returns that are in the mid-teens at current prices.
Patrick Chidley: Okay, thanks. With regard to those additional reserves we saw, turning out to be quite a chunky deposit there. 2 questions I guess. Firstly, does it mean to say you might be able to expand the rate of production from the current guidance at all, or is that mine-life extension? Second, what are the additional - what was the potential to expand the reserve additionally, in view of what you've done in 2014 on the exploration side?
Gary Goldberg: I think - and this is in particular at Merian, we're looking at least at this stage to extend the mine life. What it really does, because we found half of that was saprolite. It extends that period before you have to make investments in additional power and grinding capacity to be able to process the ore. It actually extends that. What we've been looking at is a 5- to 6-year period. It extends that period.
Laurie Brlas: The additional reserves we just added are not part of the original economics that we've provided, so that's up side which we indicated we expected, but now it's materialized.
Patrick Chidley: Okay, great. Then exploration wise, any discoveries in the area, or something that would be worth highlighting now?
Gary Goldberg: Not today. I have to wait until we get to a better position. But I think we've classified this whole area as a new district for us that has good potential up side, and we're exploring in that region.
Patrick Chidley: Okay, thanks. If I may, just one quick more, sorry. Yanacocha, the oxide and sulfide deposits for life-of-mine extension, any more details on that?
Gary Goldberg: We're going through a project that we call project integral to look at our different options to both extend some of the oxide deposits, either through some of the open-pit opportunities there, as well as the potential to go underground. The sulfide deposits, we get into both gold and gold copper, and we're looking at all those alternatives. We'll keep people briefed as we go through that process. We've got a timetable that puts us really through most of this year, looking with our partners, Buenaventura, at a variety of different options.
Patrick Chidley: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Jorge Beristain: Good morning, everybody. My question I guess more for Laurie, but I really do appreciate the concise EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA break-downs that were provided this quarter. It makes our lives easier.
Laurie Brlas: You're welcome.
Jorge Beristain: Thank you. Also, if you could - you have given us some visual clarity on the CapEx outlook for Merian, but could you be a bit more specific? Just looking at 2015, eye balling the chart on Page 21, it looks like $350 million of CapEx in 2015, and $150 million in 2016. Is that right?
A - : Yes, that's reasonable, Jorge. Yes.
Jorge Beristain: Would there be any kind of working capital or inventory cash flow requirements of that project in second half of 2016 as you start to ramp it up?
Laurie Brlas: There might be a little, but it shouldn't be much. We wouldn't be building stockpiles or anything like that. At that point in time, we could change the way that we're processing.
Jorge Beristain: Okay. Thank you again, and great results.
Laurie Brlas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Graf with Cowen. Your line is open.
Adam Graf: Thank you and congratulations. I have a couple of specific questions, Gary. Maybe - you've mentioned it briefly, but you could talk about at Batu Hijau where you guys currently stand on an export tax, and how that is going to potentially increase going forward, depending on the status of the completion tests?
Gary Goldberg: Okay. Where we currently are at, we're paying a 7.5% export duty, and that is scheduled to decline to 5% and then to 0% based on progress that's assessed with the Ministry of Mines towards the development of a smelter. At this stage we're working through that process. I understand where Freeport ended up as a data point. I believe they're paying 7.5% in their current extension, so I would expect that could be where we end up, and then see where we end up 6 months from there. It's kind of a staged approach, but that's where we're currently at, Adam.
Adam Graf: Okay. Then on a different subject, quite impressive with the expectations at Tanami, and I was hoping you maybe could give us some further details for 2015, 2016, 2017 as you guys see the through-put and the grade profile.
Gary Goldberg: Yes, I think what we'll do there, and that project's coming up for review here within the next couple of months, as we get to the point where we would approve it we'll provide more details on production and cost and returns of that project. But I've been very pleased with the exploration success at both Tanami and the neighboring deposit there, Federation.
Adam Graf: One last question, if I may. At Merian, when you guys make the transition, whatever that happens to be from the saprolite ore to the fresh ore, how do you see the incremental increased costs in milling, crushing and milling per ton?
Gary Goldberg: Yes, we're looking - that's probably going to be out in the 2022, 2023 time frame. We'll provide more detail as we get a little bit closer to that. I wouldn't see - the grade stays actually fairly consistent as we go through that, so it's really the ore hardness. You'd have the increased power and grinding costs that would go with that, so your milling processing costs would tend to go up 30% to 40% at that stage.
Adam Graf: So 30% to 40% on the say, processing cost per ton?
Gary Goldberg: Yes, just on the processing cost. I think if you carry that back to our all-in sustaining costs that we're looking at something closer to about a 15% increase that would occur at that time. That's why finding more saprolite ore and pushing that time out is always a good thing.
Adam Graf: Yes, exactly. Very good. Congratulations again. Thanks for answering my questions.
Gary Goldberg: You bet. Thanks, Adam.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Tanya with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Tanya Jakusconek: Hi. It's Tanya with Scotiabank. How are you guys?
A - Gary Goldberg: Didn't think you changed overnight.
Tanya Jakusconek: I didn't. I think I'm still publishing under Scotia. Sorry, just back to my train of thought. On Batu Hijau, Gary, can you give us an update? I think it was mentioned on the submarines tailings disposal that you're re-looking that, or we have a permit to update? Secondly, I think there's labor negotiations going on?
Gary Goldberg: Thank you. In regards to tailings, we don't have any permit extensions or changes going on there. We're continuing to work under existing permit. Nothing to flag on that. In terms of labor agreements, both in Ghana and in Indonesia we have labor negotiations going on. Basically, we're working with the representatives in both of those groups to lay out the facts, here's the economics, and work towards a reasonable agreement for all parties. So nothing to report in terms of progress or in terms of issues at either one of those locations.
Tanya Jakusconek: Then Gary, what sort of labor inflation are you seeing in your assets around the world, like maybe what are you seeing in South America? What are you seeing in Africa and Australia? Gary Goldberg, Newmont Mining Corporation - President & CEO 52 It varies, but we've seen clearly a cooling off in Australia, from what had been historically some double-digit rates down more to the lower range, like 3% to 4%, which is probably similar to what we see in most of the other regions around the world.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. Then Africa and South America?
Gary Goldberg: Same sort of rates in those regions, as well.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay. The same with let's say the US, so 3% to 4% would be a natural wage inflation?
Gary Goldberg: Yes.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay.
Gary Goldberg: Probably closer to 3%, my COO is saying to me.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, all right. That's good to see, because that was as you know as high as 7%, 8% weighted average not too long ago.
Gary Goldberg: I think the overall commodities cooling off has helped us, as well.
Tanya Jakusconek: While I have you on, what about the consumables? Are we seeing a bit of relief at all in cyanide costing?
Gary Goldberg: I mentioned when I went through one of the areas where we've been getting some improvements, we've gone back really on almost all of our contracts now through all the regions and seen significant reductions in what those costs are. Cyanide also depends on some of the input costs there, but we have seen some reductions.
Tanya Jakusconek: Would you be able to give us an idea of what range, because that one had always been a very sticky one, because I think there's just very few suppliers.
Gary Goldberg: I'm going to have to take a look. I don't know off the top of my head what the details are on that and get back to you, Tanya.
Laurie Brlas: We can get back to you, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Okay, perfect. We understand on the exploration side the exploration costs, the development costs, and all that. Those are easier to see and we have an idea. Cyanide is always one that seems to be very sticky, with only I think a handful - less than handful of producers.
Gary Goldberg: Yes.
Laurie Brlas: We'll get back to you, Tanya.
Tanya Jakusconek: Especially if you have to be cyanide compliant, right?
Gary Goldberg: Always.
Tanya Jakusconek: Yes. Thank you.
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Tanya.
Operator: We have a question from Misha Levental with Cowen.
Misha Levental: I was just wondering with Long Canyon you said a funding decision's coming up. What's going to be the basis of the funding decision, and can we get an update on the permit status? When do you think you would need to break ground to stay on track for a 2017 production target?
Gary Goldberg: Thanks, Misha. We're going through the permitting process now. That's basically the last item for review before we get approval to move forward. We're I think making good progress working with the BLM and the folks in the region there, so we'd expect that here any time. As we pointed out, here this quarter. Assuming it occurs this quarter, that keeps us on schedule for 2017. Once we do get that approval, we'll provide more details around that project from the standpoint of capital and returns, but it clearly is a project that we see as a good next step for growth in Nevada, and really a new district in Nevada.
Misha Levental: Okay. You don't have a time frame on what the - on how long construction would last?
Gary Goldberg: No. It would - assuming we get this approval here in the next month or so, we would see construction completed and production started in 2017.
Misha Levental: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you.
Operator: We have another question from John Bridges with JPMorgan.
John Bridges: Just a quick follow-up. With Yanacocha, the discussions with Buenaventura, any other options other than the deep oxides and the surface leech? Anything added to that list?
Gary Goldberg: I think just whether - it gets more to the processing options in terms of how you'd process and manage the enargite-type ores are another thing. You look into potential processing and how you might handle some of the concentrates - either concentrate leech, some sort of process like that, and how you might do that.
John Bridges: Okay. We'll look forward to the results of that. Thank you.
Gary Goldberg: Great. Thanks, John.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche. Your line is open.
Jorge Beristain: Hi guys, just a follow-up. I would like to welcome Tanya to the Deutsche Bank family. I just want to follow up with Gary really on your view on the copper operations. We did see significant improvements, particularly at Batu Hijau in the fourth quarter. But overall, in aggregate your copper ops are still doing about a $2.39 per pound all-in sustaining cost, pretty close to the world copper price right now. I was wondering, given that some of your competitors have made statements about reaffirming their commitment to gold, and even threatening to put some of their operations into care and maintenance, what your view is at stressed copper prices on how to deal with some of those operations. In other words, are you willing to run those operations at a cash flow loss for a certain period, or are you going to take a harder line and put them on care and maintenance if they're not cash flow positive?
Gary Goldberg: They've got to earn their keep. There's no one that is going to run at a cash flow loss. We used $2.50 copper price when we did our budgets for the next 3 years. We built that sort of thinking in when we did the numbers. I don't see any concerns at all at Batu Hijau at current market prices. At Phoenix and at Boddington, we continue to work to reduce our costs and make sure we're profitable on both the copper and the gold side. They are a combined set of operations. You can't separate the two, as you know. We're looking to make sure they deliver good value throughout the cycle on metal prices.
Jorge Beristain: Great, thank you.
Gary Goldberg: Great. Operator, I'll go ahead and just close things out here. Thank you everyone for joining today. I really look forward to continuing to share how we're executing our strategy to improve our underlying business, to strengthen our portfolio, and to continue to create shareholder value. Thanks again everyone for your time today, and look forward to catching up. Thanks.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc. 2014 third quarter conference call for Thursday, October 30, 2014. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeffrey Wilhoit: Thank you, Melanie, and welcome to the Goldcorp third quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Capital Management. For those of you participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this afternoon's discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, and costs and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. There is a lot to discuss about our results this quarter, but I have to start with the fact that we've commenced production at two new outstanding gold mines in just the last three months. Production commenced at both Cerro Negro and Éléonore on schedule and on budget, and both are ramping up towards commercial production largely as planned. In an environment where very few new mines are being successfully commissioned, we at Goldcorp are all very proud of this achievement. And I want to recognize the great work of our teams in Argentina and Quebec as well of the capital projects group in Vancouver. As we look forward, Cochenour, the last of our three new gold projects also remains on track towards achieving production in the third quarter and next year. As planned, we expect to source ore from our development headings at Cochenour very soon, so we'll actually be processing the first gold there before yearend. At the other end of the spectrum, our gold production during the third quarter was below expectations. However, the gold didn't go anywhere. The production is delayed rather than lost. So as has been the case for us in prior years, because we are growing production, we expect a very strong fourth quarter finish and to achieve our 2014 production guidance. Due to the challenges with the high wallet El Sauzal and the earlier shutdown at Los Filos, we expect to come in at the low end of our guidance of between 2.95 million and 3.1 million gold ounces. On our second quarter conference call, we said that we would see higher all-in sustaining costs in the second half of the year than in the first half, due to planned higher sustaining capital spending, but that we still expected to meet our guidance for the year. That certainly remains the case. And with year-to-date all-in sustaining cost of $918 per ounce, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our cost guidance range between $950 and $1,000 an ounce. Our reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by a number of unusual items that Lindsay will walk through. But our overall financial performance was solid, with adjusted operating cash flow of $399 million. Our capital spending is expected to be well within our guidance range between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. During most of this year, debate over when and how the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates helped fueled the downward pressure on gold price, and we're seeing that today. As we stated frequently, Goldcorp is positioned for success in the current metals price environment or even lower, but I believe that this focus on short-term gold price catalyst ignores an important trend of much greater long-term importance. To put simply, our industry is not discovering as much gold as it once did, despite a significant increase in exploration investment. As such, it's reasonable to conclude that global gold production is facing a sustained multi-year decline that cannot help, but positively impact the supply demand fundamentals, and therefore the price of gold. In other words, I don't believe our industry will ever mine as much gold as we do in 2015. And so as to price, our expectation is for gold to trade in a fairly narrow range over the next six to 12 months. But I expect supply and demand factors to play an increasingly important role in the way gold is valued over the longer term. Given declining supply and continuing strong physical demand indicators, we are bullish on long-term gold prices. In this environment, I believe the market will place a premium on those gold companies with assets that are long-lived, low-cost and exhibit strong potential for reserve growth. On these metrics, Goldcorp compares very favorably with our peer group. We're quite pleased that Goldcorp has managed its balance sheet and liquidity such that we are one of the only gold companies that has not cut its dividend. We have funded the acquisition and construction of our new gold mines through operating cash flow and the divestment of non-core assets, as opposed to onerous debt and equity dilution. This disciplined approach along with the free cash flow projected for 2015 and beyond, as the new mines become net contributors to our financial results, means that Goldcorp will retain the flexibility to both, fund continued grow and also return value to our shareholders through a sustain dividend. Looking forward, this is a busy time at Goldcorp. We'll of course be focused on safely delivering the production, we expect in the fourth quarter at low all-in sustaining costs. The ramp ups at Cerro Negro and Éléonore will continue towards commercial production, will be advancing Cochenour towards production next year and will be putting together the results from some of our exciting exploration work around the company, such as at the HG Young project at Red Lake, the deep skarn in Peñasquito and lower mine drilling in Éléonore. We're in the midst of defining our 2015 budgets and updated mine plans and we look forward to providing our expectations for 2015 and beyond early in the New Year. So a lot of work ahead, but the one thing that stands out is that with new production coming on, lower expected all-in sustaining costs going forward and capital spending on the projects coming to an end, we should be generating stronger financial returns including free cash flow in 2015 and beyond, even in a flat gold price environment. So put simply, we're all very excited about the future at Goldcorp. And with that, I'll turn it over to George, to discuss the operations in a bit more detail.
George Burns: Thanks, Chuck. Goldcorp mines delivered third quarter production of 651,700 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of a $1,066 per ounce. Ignoring the non-cash impairment at Peñasquito, all-in sustaining cost was around a $1,000 per ounce. One of the big quarter-on-quarter changes was at Peñasquito, due mine plan sequencing, which included processing of stockpiles. We are looking forward to a strong fourth quarter at Peñasquito supporting our expectations to achieve our annual cost and production guidance. Several of the mine successfully completed initiatives to position the operations for the rest of the year and into 2015, including completion of the 2014 de-stress program at Red Lake, leach pad construction at Los Filos, and integrating Hollinger production at Porcupine. El Sauzal remained a focus following the suspension of operations due to an instability of the Trini pit high wall. For safety reason, we have made the decision to accelerate our closure plan from the first quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of this year with an estimated loss of about 60,000 ounces of gold production in 2014. Our focus now turns to making the mine a successful enclosure and reclamation, as it was in operation. Alumbrera also contributed to our changes during the quarter, due to a geotechnical event to suspended operations in the pit for the final six weeks of the quarter. Operations have resumed in early October. With first gold now poured at Cerro Negro and Éléonore, the teams at site are working well to hand up responsibilities to the respective operations groups. All-in sustaining cost of $1,066 per ounce increased as expected compared to the second quarter, driven by higher plant sustaining capital spending. As Chuck stated, we remain on track toward the lower end of our cost guidance range. Year-to-date, cost performance at our mines reflect the ongoing success of our Operating for Excellence program. Through just the first nine months of this year, savings from [indiscernible] have nearly doubled compared to our previous $100 million projection for the entire year. It has been gratifying to see these successful initiatives evolve from the conceptual stage to execution. I believe we are still in the early stages of this effort and we have much more to come. Turning to our operations and starting with Red Lake. Safe gold production increased to 99,600 ounces, while all-in sustaining cost decreased to $955 per ounce. I should note that we had about 9,000 ounces that we're not reported at the end of the quarter, due to a furnace failure that was remedied shortly thereafter. Increased production over the prior quarter was a result of higher grade and tons from the high grade zone, following the completion of the planned de-stress activities that contributed to increase stope availability. With the de-stress program completed, we expect a strong fourth quarter from this mine. Drilling continued from the surface on the HG Young target during the quarter was strong exploration results. This is an exciting new target about 1.5 kilometers Northwest of the Campbell complex. Rehabilitation is focused on the 14 level of Campbell complex, which will provide access to the HG Young underground exploration time and drilling during early in 2015. At Peñasquito, safe production was 129,500 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,142 per ounce. Production decreased compared to the prior quarter as a result of mine sequencing. All-in sustaining cost increased over the prior quarter due to lower gold production, higher sustaining capital and higher operating cost attributable to a reduction in carrying value of the long-term stockpile. Grades and recoveries mined from the pit were as planned. Construction of the Northern Well Field is progressing with completion on track for mid-2015. In the meantime, we are seeing no restrictions due to water availability. The pre-feasibility studies for concentrate enrichment process and pyrite leach projects continue to advance and are expected to be completed near yearend. These projects have the potential to unlock significant long-term value at Peñasquito. In closing, another safe quarter production sets us up for a strong finish to the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Russell, for a review of our projects.
Russell Ball: Thanks, George. Good day to those on the call. As Chuck noted, it was a busy quarter for the projects team, with the key milestone of first gold having been achieved in Cerro Negro and Éléonore. The third quarter was a significant step forward on our journey to derisk and deliver the industry's leading growth profile. This doesn't happen without talented and dedicated people, and I wanted to thank the teams at Cerro Negro and Éléonore for their dedication and commitment to delivering these projects safely and in line with our cost and scheduled commitments. We begin at Éléonore in Northern Quebec on Slide 13. We report first gold from the gravity circuit on October 1. The floatation, leaching and tailings floatation circuits have all now been commissioned, and we are progressing up the ramp up curve in line with expectations. We continue to expect to produce between 40,000 and 60,000 ounces this year and should be able to declare commercial production in early 2015. With construction essentially complete, initial capital cost guidance range remains unchanged between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. At quarter-end, the exploration ramp reached depth of 788 meters and the production shaft was approximately 65% complete through a depth of 975 meters. Drilling continues to focus on exploration and infill drilling in the lower mine, where we are seeing very positive results. The next Slide shows our timeline, which remains unchanged from the previous quarter, with the exception of first gold having occurred on October 1. The project remains on track to declare commercial production in the first quarter of 2015, and to ramp up to design throughput of 7,000 tons per day in the first half of 2018. We continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate this schedule. The next slide shows some recent photos, including the team celebrating the first gold pour milestone earlier this month, and the first 50 ton haul truck that will transport tailings to the storage facility. Turning to Slide 16, at Cerro Negro in Argentina. We poured first gold on July 25, the key milestone for the project. After a challenging August, in which mill availability and throughput were limited by temporary power-related issues, upsets in the flotation and leach circuit as a result of those power issues, and instrumentation and process control system issues, I'm happy to say, we had a much better September and that trend has continued in October. For the third quarter, we produced 19,000 ounces of gold and 234,000 ounces of silver. Based on the continued improvement in operating performance, we expect to be in a position to declare commercial production by the end of this year. On the construction site, we essentially complete, although we still have to complete some of the initial scope we deferred to 2015. Initial capital cost estimate has been narrowed between $1.65 billion and $1.7 billion. The construction of the high voltage power line is now complete, with commissioning underway by the Argentinean Power Authority. Energization of the substation and permanent power from the grid is now expected by the end of the fourth quarter. Underground development at Eureka in Mariana Central during the quarter totaled 2,300 meters. With a considerable focus this quarter, we're getting backfill placement and underground services caught up. We expect to resume development of Mariana Norte in early 2015. Production continues at Eureka, with production mining at Mariana Central expected to commence in early 2015. The old stockpile at quarter end was approximately 548,000 tons, at an average grade of almost 9 grams per ton gold and a 150 grams per ton silver. Slide 17 shows our timeline for achieving commercial production later this quarter. The only significant deliverable as I mentioned from a construction perspective is the commissioning of the permanent power system. The mill is running very well and we have already had extended periods, where we run the plant above the nameplate design throughput of 4,000 tons per day. Slide 18 shows some recent photos from the site, including the main substation, coarse ore stockpile and warehouse under construction. Turning to Slide 19, at Cochenour and Red Lake. Initial gold production from development ore remains on track for later this quarter with no change to the initial capital cost estimate of about $500 million. The haulage drift and ramp development to the 3,540 foot level, were completed during the quarter, in line with our schedule. On the exploration side, drilling continues on the Bruce Channel deposit with eight drills currently drilling from underground. Total of 28,300 meters were drilled in the quarter, and the results are meeting our expectations. At this point, the construction efforts is essentially complete and we will be turning the remaining mine development over to George's operating group in early 2015, to help advance the integration of Cochenour into the larger Red Lake complex. Slide 20 shows the timeline for Cochenour, which remains unchanged and we continue to expect commercial production in the second half of 2016. As we turn Cochenour, Cerro Negro and Éléonore over to operations, the project's team is focusing on advancing a number of organic opportunities within the company, including the CEP and pyrite leach projects at Peñasquito, TVZ underground at Porcupine and Camino Rojo and El Morro. Before tuning the call over to Lindsay, I wanted to take a couple of minutes to discuss our El Morro project in Chile. On October 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the court of appeals, thereby invalidating the environmental assessment resolution, commonly referred to as the RCA. As a result, all project development activities have been suspended, while we evaluate the path forward. We remain committed to open an transparent dialogue with all stakeholders and we'll continue to engage at the local, provincial and federal level to determine how we develop the projects, so that all stakeholders benefit from the responsible development of El Morro. This will take time, but we believe it can be done and Goldcorp can move this project forward. With that, over to Lindsay for the quarter's financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks, Russell. Turning to the financial results for the quarter. Adjusted net earnings totaled $70 million or $0.09 per share compared to $164 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter. The drop in our adjusted earnings was primarily attributable to the $36 million or $0.04 per share after-tax non-cash reduction in the carrying value of low grade stockpiles at Peñasquito, lower revenues due to lower realized prices and a higher effective tax rate in the third quarter. To calculate adjusted net earnings, we start with our reported net loss of $44 million or $0.05 per share, add back the El Sauzal and derivatives losses of $13 million and $14 million respectively, plus the non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $85 million included in the tax provision. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is disclosed on Page 43 of our MD&A. Consistent with previous quarters, we did not make any adjustments to the non-cash share based compensation expense, which amounts to $90 million or $0.02 per share. The income tax provision used as a basis to calculate our third quarter adjusted earnings included in the MD&A has an applied tax rate of a negative 3% compared to an effective tax rate of 39%, when we proportionally consolidate Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera. To calculate the effective tax rate, one needs to adjust the book income tax expense of $83 million for the following items. Subtract the foreign exchange losses on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $85 million, add back the income tax expense related to the third quarter earnings of PV and Alumbrera of $39 million and the tax impact on the impairment of the mining interest of $9 million. Then from earnings before tax, the following adjustments are made. Deduction of net earnings of associates of $15 million and stock-based compensation of $90 million, representing permanent differences, as these items will never be taxable. And add back the earnings before tax for PV and Alumbrera, $47 million, plus the impairment of mining interest of $24 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 39% for the quarter. The outlook for 2014, effective tax rate remains at 26% for the year and 36% for the fourth quarter, excluding the foreign exchange impact on deferred taxes. Turning to provisional pricing. We have negligible provisional pricing impacts at Peñasquito and a negative $4 million at Alumbrera. The provisional sales at September 30 at Peñasquito include 78,000 ounces of gold priced at $1,217 per ounce, 3.4 million ounces of silver at $17.11 per ounce, 40.6 million pounds of zinc priced at $1.04 per pound, and 22.5 million pounds of led priced at $0.94 per pound. While at Alumbrera we have 15,600 ounces of gold priced at $1,213 per ounce and 20.2 million pounds of copper priced at $3.03 per pound. All-in sustaining costs for the third quarter were $1,066 per ounce compared to $852 per ounce in the prior quarter. The all-in sustaining costs for the third quarter were impacted by the reduction in the carrying value of low grade stockpiles at Peñasquito of $41 million or $64 per ounce. Backing out this $41 million, our third quarter all-in sustaining costs are close to $1,000, which is consistent with our expectations and allow us to come in at the lower end of our guidance between $950 and $1,000 per ounce of gold for the year. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet. We continue to generate strong adjusted cash flows from operations that amounted to $400 million or $0.49 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $863 million of a convertible senior note, which matured August 2014, leaving $2.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding. We invested $532 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid a $122 million in dividends of this quarter. Of the $532 million, 49% of the spending related to our capital projects; a $103 million and $155 million at Cerro Negro and Éléonore, respectively. With $428 million in cash, plus $1.45 billion available on our revolving credit facility, our liquidity is more than adequate. The ramp up of gold production at Cerro Negro, the on schedule commencement of gold production at Éléonore and our portfolio quality mines support our expectation in spite the challenges we had during the year due to the work stopped at Los Filos and the accelerated mind closure plan at El Sauzal that we are expecting a strong financial finish to the year. As we complete our major capital spend on our new mines during the fourth quarter, our balance sheet is in great shape and with 2015 forecasted to generate free cash flow, we are well-positioned for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to you, operator, for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: My question, first one is on the Cerro Negro, and obviously going to permanent power, what sort of trends are you seeing in cost down there already. I know its early stage, but just be hopeful. And also, are you seeing any sort of help from the falling oil price. And when you're doing with power, what sort of split will the power be of total cost or total power cost between grid and diesel.
Russell Ball: Andrew, you've asked a couple of questions and I'll try to take the ones I recall. We all largely spot-based, the big variable being exchanged rate obviously in Argentina, as we convert the U.S. dollar prices essentially into that. Right now, the cost of running the diesel are about $2 million a month. So when we look at on still capacity, somewhere around 20 meg is what we'll be drawing and I believe the contracted is roughly $0.11. The intention is to run fully on good power. Again, we have to have that hooked up here before the end of the quarter. And so the savings if you want will be roughly $2 million a month as we transition off a diesel onto permanent power.
Charles Jeannes: Andrew, this is Chuck. I guess the cost question for Cerro Negro, so like any new mine there is a lot of things going on right now, lot of moving parts and we are in that phase where we are basically discovering a lot of the cost trends ourselves relative to what was planned for in the feasibility study. And I can just say that a lot of that is impacted by the inflation situation in Argentina and the timing of devaluation of the Peso. And so we've got a big kick, a help from the devaluation in January and you recall that, that essentially cut our or contributed to us being able to cut our capital spending by $100 million. The stress is building backup again. There is a big spread between the official rate and the rate on the street. And so we look forward to news in that regard coming forward in terms of devaluation.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: And just a second one on Éléonore. Any sort of, and again, I know it's really early, but are you guys getting any sort of relief from the weakness in the currency. And can you guys just remind us how much of cost is incurred.
Russell Ball: Predominantly, all of the operating cost are Canadian dollar denominated. I think our assumption Lindsay for the balance this year was a $1.10. So roughly in line with the way we are. So I'd say that those numbers that we provided on Éléonore reflect roughly the current exchange rates. So we clearly will see come on the operating side as we go forward.
Operator: The following question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Just following up on the nature of the write-downs -- sorry, better put that or, stockpile deferral at Peñasquito. Could you just explain, is that tied at all to the write-downs that you saw in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the change in the mine plan there? And I am just trying to understand was this really related to the dip that we saw in the gold price in the third quarter that you guys made the decision to push back those stockpiles or what was driving that? Was it sequencing or reaction to the metal's price?
George Burns: Its sequencing. So as always, in our minds, we're focused on cash flow and the best ore goes in first and so the low grade stockpiles basically have been pushed out further into the life. And as a result there is an accounting trigger, so that's it.
Charles Jeannes: The way I look at this, and my glass is half full, but this really is good news, because it means that we found higher grade and better material to put through the mill rather than those low grade stockpiles and they've been pushed out and then on a time value of money, that means there is an accounting charge. But what you'll see, and of course that's non-cash charge, what we expect to see going forward at Peñasquito is incrementally improved performance as a result of that better material that we've located and sourced for the mill.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: And understood from a net present value point of view. What I'm just trying to understand is if you guys took the write-downs in the fourth quarter, why this would generate a new write-down? And is this it, and just trying to establish kind of like what the new normal is at Peñasquito? Are you through with these kind of write-downs?
Lindsay Hall: Since George is driving the mine plan, I'm driving the accounting. As Chuck and George have alluded to, you had a better mine plan, so you pushed the stockpile to the backend of the mine life, which is the right operational effect. So that's part of the $40 million or $55 million write-down or $36 million after-tax, time value money. The other thing is that we look at stockpiles on a net realizable value every quarter, so some of it, we look at the value and the stockpile and some of the loss attributable to the write-down and the stockpile is recognizing a less few ounces in this low grade stockpile, plus pushing it out to the backend. So that's the accounting logic driving this write-down, and it's just an improved life-of-mine plan, pushing the stockpiles out, recognizing less ounces perhaps in the stockpile. And we're quite comfortable with it. So it has nothing to do with really metal prices per se or anything to do with our impairment on Peñasquito in the last year.
Charles Jeannes: And I should add that, in fact we've been consistent with the metal prices that we've been using $1,200 for this year and $1,300 long-term on all of the numbers that we provided to you so.
Operator: The following question is from Patrick Chidley of HSBC.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Just I wanted to ask some detailed questions on Peñasquito. Just you mentioned, in fact you demonstrated that we're looking for a very big quarter in the fourth quarter. We can see where some of that's coming from in terms of Cerro Negro and the contribution from Éléonore, but must be something else that's growing. Is Peñasquito due for much higher grades in the fourth quarter?
George Burns: We're definitely looking for a strong quarter really at all of our mines. Peñasquito, yes, we had a really good second quarter. We're looking for similar results in the fourth quarter. Red Lake's another cornerstone mine for us, and we're looking for an outstanding quarter coming out of Red Lake relative to the prior three. And I'll just tell you, if you look back to last couple of years, you'll see a pretty good trend at Goldcorp, where we have strong fourth quarters and we're looking for that to occur this year, and it's really contributions from everyone of our mines.
Charles Jeannes: If I can just add Patrick, the thing at Red Lake is that as you know we have to do this de-stress activities to open up the high-grades zone. And that was all completed during the last quarter. And so the high-grade zone is now fully available to us. And so it's not just trying to get more tons or more grade, this is in consistent with the mine plan based on those de-stress activity.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: And just a quick question then on Alumbrera, you mention that it was down for the last, especially half of last quarter, last six weeks and just wanted to find out, are you back into normal production there or is it going to be -- for the fourth quarter is going to be rather weak again?
Charles Jeannes: We're expecting a strong fourth quarter. So right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we actually got the second ramp three established access to the bottom on the pit. So we're once again feeding the mill from fresh ore out of the pit rather than low grade stockpiles, so strong quarter coming from Alumbrera.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: And last question just quickly on Cerro Negro. Lower ore throughput there, maybe I missed it, but what was the story there in terms of the mill throughput and is that sort of something that is going to be obviously higher in the fourth quarter, higher rate?
Russell Ball: We had some issues around the diesel generators and the ability to keep them running with some off-spec diesel, some control issues in the plant from an instrumentation perspective that upset the circuit, we have to shutdown and get that back on track. So as I said, August was a challenging month, but we saw a great turnaround with some additional help from our teams here helping out, and in October continues. So as a result of the challenging August we'll be at the lower end of that 130,000 to 180,000 guidance, but as I said, we see no restrictions on the plant. We can run the plant for extended periods at 4,000 ton a day. So we feel very good. And maybe I'll ask George for his perspective since he's going to own it pretty soon.
George Burns: Yes. I mean the ramp up, I would say, we had a bit of slow start, but it's been running really well the last six weeks. We're consistently beating our throughput targets. Recoveries look good. And we're set up for a good fourth quarter and a good 2015 out of that new plan.
Operator: The following question is from Greg Barnes of TD Securities.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Just, I don't want to flog a dead horse, but Cerro Negro again, the mining rates seems quite low relative to the 4,000 ton a day mill. And I know you're having some problems getting miners. How do you see that evolving over next year or so?
George Burns: You're right. Our ramp up of getting qualified miners has been a challenge. I think early in the year we had a contractor on site that was removed and so we're in that process of bringing in support to train miners and ramp up our experience level on the underground and things are headed in the right direction -- 
Charles Jeannes: This is Chuck. I just want to apologize to everybody. We had some technical difficulties with the outbound phone lines here in Vancouver in this building, so had just reconnected. I hope there is people still listening. And if so operator, let's go back to the questions. If Greg Barns is available we can go back and continue the question that he had asked.
Operator: Mr. Burns your line is now open.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Yes, I am still here. Go ahead.
George Burns: Thanks Greg, sorry about that.
Russell Ball: Greg, so just following on from George, I don't recall exactly where we cut off, but we have at the end of the quarter roughly a 500,000 tons stockpile, so the plant in the mine sequencing reflects us consuming that stockpile roughly by the end of the third quarter depending on how the mill perform. So we're looking at bringing on additional production at our Mariana Norte. Remember, we suspended development of Mariana Norte last July, and will be back in resuming developments in early 2015. So the stockpile is the immediate [indiscernible] and long-term is to get all three of the mines up to full development rate.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: The second was on Red Lake because tonnage mill there has come down. Quite a large amount in last couple of quarters. Is that now around 160,000 tons a quarter. Is the more the rate you plan on going forward or is that going to come back up again?
George Burns: We're expecting a stronger fourth quarter in terms of mill throughput and gold production. Looking at the bigger picture, we are transitioning Campbell's ramping down and the project over it, Cochenour is ramping up. So if you're looking broader, throughput is down from where we were a few years back and it will be ramping up as Cochenour comes on in the short term. Look for a stronger fourth quarter both on tons grade and gold production.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Just a bigger quick question. With the two last drilling projects done effectively in the next six months and the growth peaks I guess in 2016, what are you thinking beyond that. I know you've got Camino Rojo and El Morro, but does it bake a long-term projects. What are you thinking in the interim.
Charles Jeannes: We'll, we've got a lot of organic growth opportunities. And if you look at our standard corporate presentation on the website, there is a slide there that shows them all. And one of the ones, just back to Red Lake that I am very excited about is HG Young. We look at Red Lake as a 400,000 to 500,000 an ounce a year producer into the long-term and as we bring Cochenour in, that's offsetting the losses that we're seeing right now at the Campbell side and as we get deeper the high grade zone and it gets a little skinnier, so Cochenour is just in time, but HG Young is the kind of thing that could really help us supplement high grade feed to those mills. If it ends up being big enough, it could even justify a mill expansion. So I feel a lot better about the long-term future of Red Lake having made that discovery. But that's one. And of course, the CEP and Pyrite Leach projects at Peñasquito are probably the biggest in terms of both the capital spend and the impact of the company, the economic value and we're finishing up pre-feasibility studies on those right around yearend and you should be hearing some news early in the year on that. And then we've got a variety of other things around the company in terms of moving the mill from El Sauzal down to Los Filos and expanding the underground down there, and a lot of moving parts, but we're quite comfortable with the organic portfolio that we have, which also includes, of course as you said, the bigger projects like Camino Rojo and El Morro. Having said that, we always keep our eyes out for opportunities outside the company and we'll continue to do that as well.
Operator: The following question is from David Haughton of Bank of Montreal.
David Haughton - Bank of Montreal: In George's comment, I hear he was saying that water is not so much an issue at the moment at Peñasquito. And it's pretty clear that you've got about the 115,000 tons a day throughput on the mill. Is that something that we should be thinking about even ahead of the connecting up with the well field that you can sustain that kind of throughput?
George Burns: So yes, the nameplate for the Peñasquito mill is 130,000 tons and we never got to sustain that, water got in the way. And so the team at Peñasquito is focused on debottlenecking. And we have throughputs up. As we look at budget and our long-term plan, we'll be looking for opportunities to deliver additional ore. I think at the beginning of the year, when we put our new life-of-mine plan together, the mine was the bottleneck. And so the throughput was lower than nameplate, largely due to the mine plan. You can see, our sustaining capital went up during the quarter at Peñasquito and part of it was mining equipment. So we'll be focused on putting together revised mine plan and there are opportunities to push that throughput up again. And as you stated, the water is in good shape. We've put contingencies in place to sustain the current production rates. Once that Northern Well Field is completed mid next year, we'll have sufficient water to ramp it up to further assuming the mine production can meet it. So I don't have a number for you; just look forward to next year that we'll be focused on pushing that throughput up. And I think you can tell from the current results, we're exceeding the 115,000, 120,000 ton a day for a pretty good long stretches. So there is upside there.
Charles Jeannes: I was just going to remind everybody, David, that the new life-of-mine plan technical report that we filed for Peñasquito earlier this year, assumed a long-term run out at a 115,000 tons a day. So there is upside there.
David Haughton - Bank of Montreal: And whilst we're at Peñasquito, you had mentioned advanced work on CEP and Pyrite with decision, I guess after those studies have come out. If you're thinking that you'd do one or both, what sort of should we be thinking about there? Are they sequential or together?
Russell Ball: We had them separately as we went through pre-fees, which as Chuck said is going to be done around yearend. We're actually combining and integrating those two projects. So going forward starting in '15, we'll combine those two projects into one, because there is some synergy building in both at the same time. So we look to combine them at the feasibility stage and report those, write them out, but we'll manage them as one project.
David Haughton - Bank of Montreal: And previously we've been guided that it could be around $1 billion mark. Is that still something that is reasonable to think about?
Russell Ball: Yes. As George said, we'll be done around yearend and we'll give you some updated numbers early in 2015 or maybe on the first quarter, quite frankly, because we need to get to some of our processes. But that order of magnitude is still within reason.
David Haughton - Bank of Montreal: And with a premature closure now of El Sauzal, Chuck had mentioned potential to move the mill to Los Filos. Does that have to go through a planning process for you to think through or is it something that seems to be fairly obvious as a potential to add value there.
George Burns: It's an obvious fit and really what we are doing right now is we're focusing on upside underground potential at Filos, and then the improved recoveries we'd see if we put the plant there. So we're updating capital cost estimates. We're working through sort of strategic issues with where we go next with Filos and it would be a pretty good fit.
Charles Jeannes: But to answer the question, David, we need to do a thorough analysis and study to make sure that we understand the full cost of doing it and the benefit. So we're going to be thorough there.
Operator: The following question is from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research: Roughly, where do you think the range for next year's CapEx is going to be?
Charles Jeannes: Well, we haven't completed the budgeting yet. So I can't give you a number there. John. But we have said consistently that our sustaining capital just if you look at just the mines themselves runs in the $1.1 billion or so range .You heard, Russ mentioned earlier that there is some overflow of the capital spending at Cerro Negro that falls into 2015. We've got studies going on to advance the things that I talked about in response to the last question that all costs money. So I don't want to give you a specific number until we get through our budgeting, but it certainly going to be less than the $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion you saw this year and should be substantially so.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research: Chuck, if I could ask one more, why is sustaining capital almost as large as depreciation?
Charles Jeannes: Well, I'll refer to Lindsay on why depreciation is what it is, but sustaining capital is just what it costs to keep these mines going at the rate that we want and that we strive for, and something that everybody I think understands. But sometimes when I'm talking to investors they forget that we're constantly trying to optimize these mines, and a lot of times, we come up with new ideas to enhance them, match some equipment; CEP project would be a perfect example at Peñasquito and so there is the need to continue to spend and invest in a mine as it ages, and that's where the sustaining capital comes from. It's not always just the number of truck replacements that you expected when you finish the feasibility study 10 years ago.
Lindsay Hall: John, a couple of other things from my point of view is that depreciation and inflation picks up, the fact we acquired from properties. And in the sustaining capital, on a go forward basis, the new mines will have very little cash sustaining capital, but the older mines will have higher sustaining capital and depreciation, which is taking your book value and dividing it by the reserves and ounces gives you on a per ounce calculation. So once booked, once acquired property, that's a depreciation. Sustaining capital, the new mines take a very little cash, and the older mines takes a little bit more. And in the cash side, you get underground and open pit and in the sustaining capital is a development for the underground mines. So does that helps you a bit.
Operator: The following question is from Anita Soni of Credit Suisse.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: With respect to Cerro Negro, could you just remind me -- actually also with Éléonore, how do you test for commercial production? What parameters are you looking at?
Russell Ball: There is a number, and we work closely with Lindsay group. The key one really, I think, from your perspective would be a design throughput or achieving throughput right roughly 70% of design. There are number of other factors, but I think one from an operating perspective that we focused mostly on is 70% of design, which in a case of Cerro Negro is sort of 3,000 over an extended period of, call it 30 days, so that's how we look. At the same time you need to get roughly the recovery rates you assumed in the feasibility studies. So the one we focused on again, 30 days of roughly 70% throughput through the mill provided the backend of the circuits are all working and you can get the recovery.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: And that's the same for Éléonore as well?
Russell Ball: Correct.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: And then just a question with respect to Peñasquito's grade. I think, we've talked about it a little bit. But do you think, sort of thoughts on what the grade would be at the beginning of the year are still valid? I mean, have you planned on using the stockpiles in the third quarter?
George Burns: I don't have that sort of detail by quarter, but I can tell you our stripping plan, our model performance were comfortable with the guidance we gave you for next year for Peñasquito and the stock piles are relevant. As Chuck stated, pushing those stockpiles out and replacing with high grade will give us little bit of upside, if anything.
Operator: The following question is from Michael Gray of Macquarie Capital.
Michael Gray - Macquarie Capital: Just a couple of questions on Red Lake. I just want to be clear that you seem to be sending a message that Red Lake will meet the original guidance set out in early 2014 of 440,000 ounces to 460,000 ounces?
Charles Jeannes: Michael, I'll just say we don't update guidance on a mine-by-mine basis. We're telling you that Red Lake is going to have a very strong fourth quarter, and that we're going to meet our guidance as a company. So, George, I don't know if you have any other color.
George Burns: I am just going to say, expect a really good quarter out of Red Lake relative to the prior there in. Overall, we'll hit our guidance.
Michael Gray - Macquarie Capital: And last question, just on HG drilling, five drills turning since September, it's a lot of drilling. Can you comment on the number of holes and amount of meters to date?
George Burns: I can't give you those explicit details. I can tell you we're seeing really exciting results. It's a high-grade target. We're seeing good thicknesses, good minable grades. And it's really about finding the extent of this thing and getting the development underground, where we can drill it at a more detailed level, and get a better understanding of it. So we are really excited about it. I don't have those stats right in front of me.
Charles Jeannes: Michael, as I said in my piece that as we normally do at yearend, we kind of take all the drilling results and then wrap them up either in an updated resource or reserve. And for something like HG Young, we'll certainly give you all the stats and our sense of where this thing is going more or so at the end of the year.
George Burns: Just got a number of meters, in one of our guides, it's about 50,000 meters drilled so far.
Operator: The following question is from John Bridges of JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: I was just following up on Greg Barnes's question, you detailed how you feel, it's going to be difficult for Camino Rojo gold production to be maintained. You have grown your production to a level where you generate increased cash flow, so you have choices now. Just wondered how that flattened into your expectations or full growth going forward, because probably it's going to be difficult for you to replace the quality mines, you've got at the moment from what you see in front of you?
Charles Jeannes: Well, I'm not sure how much more I can say, John, is that we do think that we have some very high-quality organic opportunities within the company to allow us to continue to grow. And I would caution that when we think of growth, we think of cash flow, not necessarily ounces. So we're looking and George and his technical services team are working very hard on our [indiscernible] programs to bring down those cost, so that we can drive increasing cash flow out of this basically the same production. And we've had good success with that, and we expect more success in the future. But we will have this free cash flow, and I think one of the things that investors invest in is management's track record in how they invest that free cash flow and how they allocate capital going forward. And hopefully we've shown that we can both bring on these construction projects as we say we will and that we've done a pretty good job, when we go outside and look for acquisitions. So going forward, we'll just continue to allocate that capital as best we can, and obviously with a goal of providing increasing value to our shareholders. So eyes wide open the whole time and try to make good sound decisions based on good data and understanding of our mines and projects.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Do you expect that investors are less focused on growth now and more on cash flow and reliability?
Charles Jeannes: I think they are being told to be focused on that, because so few companies have growth. And so, look our production continues to grow very strongly from 2014 to 2015, then 2016, and then 2017, so we have some time here to continue to work on, where that next leg of success comes for us. So I would say to the extent that we can grow with good financial disciplined and making sure that we're not just growing for the sake of growing, but actually providing strong financial returns then we'll look to do that.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: You don't tend to conserve some of the growth and the quality assets you've got make them last a bit longer.
Charles Jeannes: Well, by definition, we don't have anything on the plate for this period from the completion of the big construction expenditures on these three mines, until we start something big such as El Moro or Camino Rojo. And I don't put those in any order for any reason. I could just easily take Camino Rojo and El Morro. So there will be a gap here, where we'll be generating free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I'd like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Jeannes.
Charles Jeannes: Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody for bearing with us during that technical delay. We very much apologize for that. And also I just want to say thanks to everybody, I know you're working extremely hard with all the companies reporting this week, and so taking the time to listen into our call, we very much appreciate that. So as I said earlier, this is an exciting time at Goldcorp with our growth projects now transitioning to operations, and we certainly look forward, as we've said to a strong finish to the year, and then updating on our progress early in the New Year, so thanks very much and goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Meredith Bandy - VP of IR Gary Goldberg - President and CEO  Laurie Brlas - CFO
Analysts: Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs  John Bridges - JPMorgan David Haughton - BMO  Patrick Chidley - HSBC Greg Barnes - TD Securities Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank Brian Yu - Citi  Adam Graf - Cowen Farooq Hamed - Barclays
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Newmont Mining Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Meredith Bandy: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call. Turning to slide two, I’d like to refer you to our cautionary statement. We will be discussing a number of forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks. More information is included in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.  Now, I will turn it over to Gary.
Gary Goldberg:  Thank you all for joining us this morning. I will start by introducing Meredith Bandy, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Meredith joined us from BMO where she was an equity research analyst covering metals and mining. Many of you know Meredith from her past life. I am sure the rest of you will get to know and appreciate Meredith. I welcome this opportunity to highlight our strong second quarter results.  We continued to exceed our cost and efficiency improvement targets while maintaining planned gold production. We also made strides in optimizing our portfolio and have generated nearly $800 million in non-core asset divestitures.  Finally, we announced that we will develop the Merian mine in Suriname, the first in our optimized organic project pipeline to get the green light. Efficiency and safety go hand-in-hand and we also continued to improve our safety performance.  Turning to slide four. We’ve achieved seven straight quarters of keeping our total injury rates at or below 0.5 per 200,000 hours worked. And in the second quarter, we brought those rates down to an all-time low of 0.32. This represents industry leading performance, and more importantly, it represents 30,000 people taking accountability for working safely day-in and day-out. While we are heading in the right direction, our performance was marred by the loss of George Ayama [ph] a contract security guard at Ahafo. We continue to keep George and his family in our thoughts as we renew our commitment to working safely and looking out for each other. This photo shows our team at the Yanecocha truck shop, who recently reached one year working without injury. One shift is coming up on four years working safely proving that zero harm is possible. Our focus on improving every aspect of our business continues to pay us.  Turning to slide five. Our work to improve cost and efficiency helped us achieve a 17% per ounce reduction in gold all in sustaining costs and costs applicable to sales compared to the prior year quarter. Well some of that was related to fewer inventory write downs this year than last. 10% of our all in sustaining cost improvement was a direct result of operating more efficiently. At the same time, we were able to increase gold production by 5%, compared to the second quarter of 2013. Based on this positive trajectory, we’ve updated our 2014 outlook to reflect a 3% improvement in costs and a 2% improvement in production for the year. As we continue to optimize our project pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we’re developing Merian in Suriname, a profitable new mine that offers lower cost production and establishes a foothold in a perspective new gold district. I will cover more on Merian in a few minutes. Building on our record of delivering projects Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach on time and on budget, we are also progressing Turf Vent Shaft project in Nevada on time and on budget this year.  We also completed the sale of Jundee for $94 million on July 1st which is up slightly from the previously announced 91 million due to working capital adjustments. This brings our total proceeds from the sale of non-core assets to nearly $800 million. Finally, we made progress on improving our financial flexibility. During the second quarter we generated a $124 million in free cash flow and reduced capital expenditure by 58% over the prior year quarter. Let’s turn to more specifics on slide six. In the second quarter, we generated $359 million in cash savings on our gold all-in sustaining costs, bringing our year-to-date savings to $442 million. This puts us well ahead of schedule to achieve savings of approximately $600 million to $700 million by 2016. Quarter-on-quarter, we reduced all-in sustaining costs from $1,283 to $1,063 per ounce, an increase attributable gold product from 1.17 million ounces to 1.22 million ounces. We also increased attributable copper production by 4% quarter-on-quarter primarily through the added production at our Phoenix Copper Leach operation. I will take you through our regional performance now starting with production on slide seven. In North America, production dipped slightly from the prior year quarter due to planned lower grades of Twin Creeks, the sale of Midas and permitting issues at La Herradura, which have since been resolved. Production in South America was lower over the prior year quarter due to a plant stripping campaign. We expect production to increase in the second half of 2014 as we reached higher grades at the Yanacocha.  Our Australia New Zealand operations delivered a 12% increase in gold production quarter-on-quarter. This performance was led by our teams at Tanami and Waihi, who increased production by 53% and 64% respectively through a combination of higher grades and increased mining and throughput.  In Africa, gold production rose more than 70% quarter-on-quarter with the addition of Akyem which is running well. Akyem produced 113,000 ounces of gold at $396 per ounce, the lowest cost in our portfolio. Costs are down across the business. Turning to slide eight. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by $220 per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, this puts us below the low end of our 2014 guidance of $1,075 to $1,175 per ounce. These savings are sustainable and I will talk about the components starting with lower capital spending on slide nine. We reduced capital spending by $356 million or approximately 58% compared to the second quarter of 2013, about 75% of this reduction reflects a lower development spending as we completed Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach on time and on budget in 2013. In Africa, we delivered Akyem $93 million below our budget. Our current development expenditure is focused on completed the Turf Vent Shaft where we spent approximately $22 million in the second quarter. Shaft sinking has advanced past the half way mark and we are on target to begin operation by late 2015. Remaining capital reductions are largely the result of improved asset management which drove sustaining capital expenditure down by $78 million quarter-on-quarter. Capital is one part of the story. We have also improved productivity across the business. I will now take you to slide 10. About half of our savings show up in the reduced costs applicable to sales. These savings represent successful leverage to improve efficiency across our operations with a focus on equipment utilization, mine planning and mill recovery. For example, at Boddington, we’ve achieved a 15% increase in shovel utilization and a 30% reduction in haul truck idle time in the mine. In the mill, we’ve improved utilization rates by 13% year-to-date by improving conveyor reliability in consolidating maintenance shut downs.  In Nevada, we improved our management controls and scheduled downtime to deliver a 10% improvement in Mill 6 utilization. Sustaining capital has also been reduced across the board. As I mentioned, improving asset management has played an important role. To give you another example, we reconfigured our Ahafo plant to balance mining rigs with milling capacity, reducing stripping and related equipment cost while achieving healthier returns. We continue to optimize our exploration and project portfolio so that we are focused on our highest value opportunities. I will talk more about our project and exploration pipeline later in this call.  To sum it up, our cost performance is about steadily and relentlessly improving every aspect of our portfolio from today’s mines to tomorrow’s growth prospects. Before I turn it over to Laurie I’d like to address the current situation in Indonesia. Turning to slide 11, beside PTNNT’s best efforts to resolve the export issue, a satisfactory outcome has yet to be achieved. Indonesia’s new export restrictions and duties are in conflict with PTNNT’s existing contract of work. The team was forced to halt operations on June 5th due to their inability to export copper concentrate. Realistically, we cannot continue to produce indefinitely without revenues. Logistically, there is simply no room left to store additional concentrate. We are pursuing two parallel paths to resolve this issue as quickly as possible; first, we are continuing our efforts to engage with the government which we hope will lead to a resolution outside of the arbitration. At the same time, we have filed for international arbitration to ensure PTNNT’s rights and assets are protected for the benefit of its stakeholders. The request for arbitration means that we will seek interim injunctive relief to get our people back to work and resume exports. In the mean time PTNNT continues to ship copper concentrate produced to date to PT smelting their Graphic smelter in Indonesia. The outcome of arbitration is obviously difficult to predict but we estimate it could take at least several months to obtain a ruling an interim relief and at least several weeks to ramp back to full production if relief is granted. In the mean time, we’ve adjusted our guidance. For illustrative purposes, a revised outlook reflects receipt of an export permit by January 1, 2015.  I’ll end by reiterating our support for the people of Indonesia deriving full value from their natural resources. Our local economic contribution included 9000 direct and indirect jobs. We have paid more than $3 billion in taxes and royalties to the government to date and we demonstrated our commitment to supplying PT Smelting and other companies that intend to build copper smelters in Indonesia. We’ll keep you posted on our progress and I’ll now hand it over to Laurie.
Laurie Brlas:  As Gary described our results indicate that our focus on lower cost resulted in a strong operating and financial performance for the quarter. With this focus we reduced cost, increased volume, delivered positive free cash flow and improved guidance. Turning to slide 13 and comparing this Q2 to the prior year quarter, as you can see we experienced a 7% drop in gold price and a 13% drop in revenue over the prior year quarter.  While our production was up, we did experience a decline in sales volume primarily due to the export issues in Indonesia. Our GAAP net income from continuing operations was $182 million including a tax benefit due to a settlement with the IRS. Our full year tax rate guidance remains 37% to 40%. However, we expect to continue to see quarter to quarter swings in our tax rate, for example including the sale of Jundee our effective Q3 tax rate will be above our full year expectation. We reported adjusted net income of $101 million or $0.20 per share compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year quarter or $0.18 per share. Cash provided from continuing operations was very strong at $378 million up 27% from the year ago quarter reflecting our commitment to reducing cost and improving efficiencies. We continue to be focused on generating free cash flow and we achieved $124 million in positive free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter.  Also during the quarter, we paid a previously announced dividend and as we announced this week our board approved a dividend of the same amount payable September 26. This dividend is based on our gold linked dividend policy and the average London PM fix during the first quarter which was $1288 per ounce. Turning to slide 14, we compare adjusted net income for the quarter to the prior year quarter. Lower sales volume and commodity prices compared with the prior year quarter were essentially offset by lower cabs this year as we focused on controlling what we could control. Improvements to cab are a direct result of the productivity inefficiency gains that Gary discussed previously. Stockpile revaluation had a significant negative impact on net income last year driven by the sharp drop in commodity prices in Q2 of 2013. With our continued cost savings efforts and reprioritization of projects, we saw a decrease in year-over-year advanced projects and exploration expense. As I previously discussed, we recognize the tax benefit this quarter, however this was a lower tax benefit than we recognized in Q2 of 2013.  After considering all of that, we reported adjusted net income of a $101 million or $0.20 per share for the quarter. Turning to slide 15, we reported gold cabs for the quarter of $744 down 17% versus the prior year and at the lower end of our guidance for the year of $740 to $790. This continues to demonstrate focus and cost control as we also see in our improved 2014 guidance. The stockpile adjustments we experienced last year were a factor in the improved CAS, but we also saw significantly lower direct spend for all the reasons Gary mentioned. This lower direct spend was enough to more than offset the impact of the lower volume I mentioned earlier and the effective hedging due to the change in the Aussie dollar.  Turning to slide 16 and our capital priorities, we continue to be guided by our capital allocation strategy. First, improving financial flexibility; second, enhancing our portfolio to focus on assets with the greatest risk reward profile, and third returning cash to our shareholders.  We ended the quarter on a strong financial position with $1.7 billion in cash and non borrowings on our $3 billion revolver. We generated cash from continuing operations of $378 million which includes free cash flow of a $124 million. Since the quarter end, we completed the closure of a $575 million term loan and pay off of the convertible debt in July as planned. Our portfolio was strengthened with the decision to invest in the Merian projects. We estimate that at current gold prices, Merian can be financed out of cash flow, available cash balances and asset sales including the recently closed divestiture of our Jundee operation.  Over the last 12 months, we have generated nearly $800 million from divestitures and reported over a $100 million in free cash flow, which positions us well to move forward with the investment in Merian. We have also returned $89 million to our shareholders so far this year. And now I will turn the call back over to Gary to discuss our improved 2014 outlook.
Gary Goldberg: Second quarter was another strong quarter and we are updating our 2014 outlook accordingly. Turning to slide 18; first, we’ve reduced guidance for gold costs applicable to sales by 3% to between $720 and $760 per ounce. Four of our regions have reduced their gold all in sustaining cost outlook as well.  Second, we have increased guidance for attributable gold production by 2% to between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces. This increase reflects higher production in Africa and Australia more than offsetting the impact of the Jundee divestiture and declaration of force majeure at Batu Hijau. Our revised 2015 to 2016 guidance excludes Jundee and while we’re yet to resolve export issues in Indonesia, we remain committed to doing so. As I mentioned earlier, for illustrated purposes, we’ve presented guidance to reflect receipt of an export permit for Batu Hijau by January 1, 2015. Finally, we have updated our guidance to include Merian, with first production expected in late 2016.  Turning to slide 19. I am pleased to announce that we are moving ahead with our project in Suriname. Our team has been on the ground for 10 years shaping Merian into a profitable operation and securing a position in the perspective Guiana Shield. During Merian’s first five years of operation, we are forecasting average annual production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold, at all in sustaining cost of between $750 and $850 per ounce. Total capital to bring Merian into commercial production is estimated at between $900 million and $1 billion on a 100% basis. The Government of Suriname has the right to acquire a 25% fully funded interest including all project capital, operating expense and an earnings contribution, which could reduce Newmont’s share of project capital to $650 million. Reserves at Merian are reported at 4.2 million ounces with a projected mine life of 11 years. As Laurie mentioned, we anticipate funding Merian through cash flow and available cash balances and we will begin construction as soon as the government grants us right of exploitation. Merian is one of the several projects in our organic growth pipeline. Let’s turn to slide 20 for an update on the others. Our team has spent considerable time over the past 18 months optimizing our project portfolio so that when the time is right, we can move forward with developing projects that generate good value. This year, we are completing feasibility studies at Long Canyon in Nevada. We are taking a phased approach to developing this world class asset in the first phase is expected to deliver about 150,000 ounces of production for year at competitive cost. We anticipate reaching a decision to proceed in 2015. We are also advancing two expansion projects in Ghana. First, the Ahafo mill expansion, which would increase throughput and help counter the impact of lower grade ore. This investment is expected to add about 200,000 ounces of production and we will reach a decision to proceed in 2015.  Second, developing the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add another 200,000 ounces of production in Ghana. We will reach a decision to proceed with this project in May 2015 or early 2016.  In New Zealand, we are in the final definition stages of our Correnso mine and expect to make funding decision in the near future. This is roughly $32 million development extends the life of Waihi. The exploration drive development was completed in May and drilling is nearly done. We are working closely with the community to ensure successful development of this new underground mine.  Finally, in South America, we recently completed a review of our Conga project to assess alternative development options. At this point, there is no obviously smaller approach and we continue to review alternatives to reducing development capital especially with earth works. All told, our short-term project pipeline represents more than 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs. We also have some exciting exploration prospects. A few examples of exceptionally high grade volumes in our own backyard include Exodus and Bull Moose, which are near our existing Carlin underground operations in Nevada and Federation which is adjacent to our Tanami operations. These prospects are expected to add higher grade material to our inventory in 2014. It is still early days and we will keep you informed about our progress. Summing up our performance and prospects I will leave you with a view of where we are taking the business.  Turning to slide 21. As we demonstrated in the second quarter, we continue to strengthen our ability to create value for our shareholders in three main areas. First, through continuous cost and efficiency improvements which we are achieving by operating more efficiently not just delaying our spend; second, through continuous portfolio improvement which we are delivering by optimizing our projects and divesting non-core assets; third, by maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We are on track to maximize value in the short-term and to capture the benefits of economic recovery and demand growth in the longer-term. Our ultimate goal is to lead the gold sector and creating value for our shareholders. As always, I welcome your questions as we work towards that goal.  Thank you for your time and now over to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Andrew Quail, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs :  Just on Indonesia. If we don’t see those export permits received by sort of 1 January ’15. Do you see that will fit the construction decision or time line at Merian?
Gary Goldberg: At this stage and as we looked at our future cash flows and there are variety of gold price scenarios we are comfortable, we’ve separated those two in terms of our financing concerns. We believe we can still cover it with our existing cash flow from our operations and as Laurie mentioned potentially some additional asset sales, but we really feel comfortable without having the two linked.
 Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs : And it really is a complex situation but there is dates that you guys could give anything on visible catalyst on sort of the international arbitration case. So is it just too early to speculate?
Gary Goldberg: No, I think the ranges I gave in terms of the filing is a process that goes through nominating the different arbitrators that will represent folks and we’re going through that process now and as I mentioned several months before we get to a point of considering injunctive release. But more importantly, it’s a dual track process and from our standpoint, we’d rather reach an agreement with the government directly rather than go through the arbitration process but reach the point where we felt we needed to file that to get some certainty around the process.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs : And one on the copper guidance, it goes up in ’16. Is that a function of mine sequencing or is there something else going on there?
Gary Goldberg: Yeah, by delaying basically six months of production at Batu Hijau in the forecast that pushed some of the production that we would have received at the very end of ’14 into ’15 and also slipped some from ’15 into ’16, so it’s ’16 up. 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs : And last one just on CapEx in other South America. You guys are sort of guiding for about 225 to 270 and you are planning on about say two tenths of a million, obviously is the rest Conga or do you see sort of I’d say delaying some of that Conga that you’ve guided to in 2014 to further use that?
Gary Goldberg:  Yes, that’s basically -- Merian is the majority of it and we’ve got Conga with our water first approach going there.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question from John Bridges, JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
John Bridges - JPMorgan:  Sorry to be repetitive, but just wondering with Batu Hijau is there any case law around reopening the mine in arbitration process, you know. Do you have sort, how much confidence do you have in that scenario.
Gary Goldberg:  I think, from our standpoint in terms of case law, I’m not sure there’s a lot of examples that would mimic our exact case that’s going on but that’s why we want to continue down both arbitration path but more importantly to continue with dialogue with the government to try to reach a resolution. A lot has happened here in the last week or two in Indonesia and currently this week there’s religious holidays going on so we’ll see how the dialogue goes starting again next week.
John Bridges - JPMorgan:  Okay, in your logic (ph) about Merian you talk about a new innovative development plan there, what have you changed, the capital under there is relatively low.
Gary Goldberg:  Basically what we’ve done, we’ve slightly increased the size of the mill but more importantly over the last couple of years because we’ve had time to do additional in field drilling we’ve confirmed the amount of saprolite that’s there, which allows us to be able to give the higher and increased production rates.
John Bridges - JPMorgan:  Is there a plan to increase the scale of the mill when you get into the hard rock to maintain throughput?
Gary Goldberg:  At this point we’d be looking to add some additional crushing capacity once we get into that further down. I think the other piece getting back to what we’re looking at with Merian as we’re looking at outperforming, we’ll be working with G Mining and people who’ve had expertise in developing projects in Suriname rather than bringing in a large EPCM contractor to do the work.
John Bridges - JPMorgan:  That place will be tricky, right.
Gary Goldberg:  Yes.
John Bridges - JPMorgan:  New Zealand, just finally, is bit surprising because there’s been a talk about that asset being up for sale, any thoughts about the longer term strategy with that.
Gary Goldberg:  I think it continues a good performing asset, we see good expansion possibilities with the life as I mentioned with Corenzo and we’ll continue to work down the path of developing all our assets to their fullest capability but always be open to consideration if others should come along and value the asset more than we do.
Operator:  Thank you, next question David Haughton, BMO, your line is open. 
David Haughton - BMO :  Yes, good morning Gary, so I thank you for reintroducing that pipeline, it gives us a good idea as to where your projects are situated and the first one off the block is Merian. You’ve mentioned that there’s potential for the government to participate 25% in this project, what’s the timing and the kind of payments that they’d have to come up with to be able to do that.
Gary Goldberg:  Thanks David. The timeframe they have basically once the right of exploitation has been issued, they’ve got a 105 days in which to fund their up to 25% investment. The amount that they would fund is based on a multiple of historic cost and actually they go through a process of auditing what’s been spent to come up with what the historic costs are and then we’d fund that amount and then we’d just carry if they didn’t exercise the 25% they would pay for basically their 25% share going forward and we’d cover our 75%.
David Haughton - BMO :  Okay, and the [Indiscernible] for the government that you can read, they’re open to that kind of investment?
Gary Goldberg:  Yes, and the discussions we’ve had and we need to let them do their process and speak for themselves but they appear very interested in pursuing their 25% interest.
David Haughton - BMO :  Okay and what’s the fiscal rating that you’ve got there with the royalty in tax. 
Gary Goldberg:  Give me just a second here; I’ve got to remember the royalty rates. 
David Haughton - BMO :  At one stage I think it had been set at 5%.
Gary Goldberg:  I believe 6% is the royalty that we’ve agreed in our mineral agreement.
David Haughton - BMO :  All right, and the income tax?
Gary Goldberg:  It is 36. I need a table of all the ones from around the world because; I sure don’t want to make them all consistent but.
David Haughton - BMO :  All right and Laurie made the point that you’ve got the internal capacity to fund that, but what do you think about project finance at all for this endeavor.
Gary Goldberg:  We could at some point but at this stage we don’t see the need to do that, but at this stage we’re not considering it.
Laurie Brlas: [Indiscernible]
David Haughton - BMO :  Yes, fair enough. Okay and yes I did hear that, it sounded like you’re at the bottom of the well but I did hear that, thank you Laurie. And just finally just looking at Africa, it’s outperformed expectations and I guess the sense that one gets from that is, is it sustainable and what are the key drivers for you in making it sustainable at that, the outperformance would seem.
Gary Goldberg:  I think in Africa we’ve done a couple of things, clearly building a team on getting things settled and moving that forward has been critical. I think the team’s done a really good job and we see good production as continuing well there. With Ahafo it needed a bit of a step back, much like we did at Tanami as we stripped out some of these projects, the mill expansion and the underground it helped to expose some opportunities to improve basically the overall plan and make sure that we matched mining rates to milling rates. By doing that that’s reduced our stripping requirements here over the next year or two and helped basically to improve the overall results there. And then we can look at those expansion projects in a more measured way and bring them on in stages rather than try to bring them on all at the same time.  At the same time, we are doing work at a Ahafo North to continue to better understand that resource and how it may fit in and what the timing maybe. And we’ve looked alternatives, whether it’s a standalone mill or we try to transport or down to the existing Ahafo complex. Right now probably looking better towards a standalone mill but that’s still out there in the sea where that sits on the pipeline.
Operator: Thank you. Next question, Patrick Chidley, HSBC. Your line is open.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Just a question on Merian, back to Merian. With respect to power I understand that you are planning to use basically truck HFO into the site and generate your own power. Given that there is quite a little hydro power in Suriname, is there a chance so that government might come to the party and with some low cost hydro to actually help you develop maybe even a bigger mine in future which would be beneficial for the country similar maybe to what Quebec does with its mines for example providing low cost power and could that be linked to the government buying for example?
Gary Goldberg: Yes, Patrick thanks for the question. At this stage because of where we are located, we are not on the grid. So it would take putting reticulation and connect this up to the grid to be able to that. That said with the gen sets we are putting in and we are doing it in a staged basis because we don’t need as many to begin with. We’re expecting our power cost at current diesel prices and oil prices to run around $0.15 to $0.17 per kilowatt hour. So I wouldn’t rule that out, but at this stage it would depend on finding more ore and being able to extend our resources there to look at those sorts of alternatives. So it’s not part of our current discussions with the government.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Right, right. Just maybe the government could help on the power side, if they have trouble financing that 25% for example. And in terms of the first five years that you forecast, is that all in saprolite or when do you switch the fresh ore and when you do switch the fresh ore, is there a change in the grade profile?
Gary Goldberg: It’s all in saprolite. The grade would drop just a little bit at that stage, but it actual stays fairly consistent over the mine life and we start to get into the fresh ore, the non-saprolite ore more in year six and seven in the plan. 
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: And then six and seven does the great change at all or does it stay the same sort of average reserve grade?
Gary Goldberg: It just gets harder. It’s not much of a change in grade.  
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Okay, thanks. And just Yanacocha, based on your corporate [indiscernible] pilot program when you still receive. 
Gary Goldberg:   I was down there a couple of weeks ago and had a chance to take a look at the pilot plant and see how it’s working. So they continue to work through as you’d expect just when you are working small heaps like this, then some of that some offset that you get along the way but they are producing a good quality copper cathode, we are getting the recoveries in sort of the time frames in fact a even a little bit better in some cases and testing what’s the right size. We did this at run a mine ore and different sizes of crushing to see what gets the best recovery over time and see how that then fits into our larger plan to develop that ore body, but that still remains one of several ways of developing the copper gold portions of the Yanacocha ore body as we look also at different milling and options to handle the NRJ.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Thanks. And final question just on guide, you mentioned two options to increase production by 200,000 ounces each. Can you say whether that’s you thinking about that as replacement ounces and so you have steady production or is that going to be a net increase in production in 2017 onwards.
Gary Goldberg: Yes, I think it’s a combination. So I wouldn’t just add for 400 on top out there. But it wouldn’t completely replacement; some of it will be in expansion especially I think the underground as we would go into that because of the higher grade that we get. 
Operator:  Thank you. Next question from Greg Barnes, TD Securities. Your line is open.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Just returning to Merian again, what kind of internal rate of return do you estimate on the project at current spot gold price around 1,300?
Greg Goldberg: Current price as we see it in the high teen’s rate of return.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Is that a livid (ph) IRR or just a straight project IRR?
Greg Goldberg: It’s just a straight project IRR.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Okay. And what about more technical details regarding the stripping ratios and cost per ton mining milling those kind of details, are they available? 
Greg Goldberg: We can get back on that through Meredith. I don’t have those in front of me right now. 
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Okay, I will contract Meredith. Thanks.
Greg Goldberg: Okay. Anything else Greg?
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: No that’s it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Just really a technical question first on slide 15, you highlighted a large drop in your cost applicable to sales of 17%, the largest driver is stockpile revaluation. Could you just walk us through how that is a cash flow impact, perhaps Laurie?
Laurie Brlas:  Yes, that is really not going to be a cash flow item because that was primarily the revaluations last year that happened when the gold price dropped so we revalued the stockpiles that we have been carrying on the balance sheet so that would primarily be not a cash flow item. 
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  Okay, and then just some comments that were made earlier, I think by you Laurie about the 100 million of free cash flow. Over what period was that?
Laurie Brlas:  The last trailing four quarters.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  Then you implied that you had paid about 89 million of dividends, so the 100 million of free cash flow, I’m assuming that’s pre dividend. 
Laurie Brlas:  Correct.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  So rough number is what you earned in cash flow you paid out as dividend and then you also did about 800 million of asset sales. So, what I’m trying to understand on a go forward basis is how much do you view, you said that you internally cover Merian with internal cash flow, but you also mentioned the possibility of further asset sales so are you kind of earmarking any part of that of your 650 million CapEx to be covered by asset sales on a go forward basis.
Laurie Brlas:  No. Nothing specific like that Jorge and just a reminder that that 650 is going to be over the next three years so that expenditure covers a significant period of time here so it’s not all coming in 2014 or even ’15.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  Okay, and then in your 2016 guidance, where Merian first starts up, could you comment, are you assuming a 100% ownership at that point or are you assuming 75% and then the government comes after their 20%.
Laurie Brlas:  No, we’re assuming 100%. We would not assume that they’re coming in, all of our numbers were, they’re 100% at this point in time, the capital expenditure and the production when it comes online.
Gary Goldberg:  We’ll go ahead and change the guidance should the government decide to exercise its right and modify that going forward. It’s relatively small in 2016, you won’t see a big number change but we would get those numbers plus the change to capital expected.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  Right, and how does the timing or the contract work for the government, do they have an open time table any time up until the mine is built or even after it’s built, to exercise that 25% option or is it kind of a use it or lose it thing under a certain calendar.
Gary Goldberg:  Basically, a use it or lose it approach I guess is one way of looking at it, they’ve got a 105 days from the issuance of the right of exploitation which now that the board had approved and we’ve announced that we’re ready to move forward, that happens first and then they’ve got a 105 days.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks, and what’s the timeframe for when you believe they’re going to issue this right of exploitation.
Gary Goldberg:  We believe they have all the information they need in which to be able to issue that at this stage but need to now work closely and check in what their sort of timeframe is. I don’t expect it to be long, but it’s one we’ve got to work through with the government.
Operator:  Thank you, our final question comes from Brian Yu, Citi, your line is open.
Brian Yu - Citi :  Thanks, good morning. My first question is, I guess there’s looks more at longer term CapEx versus balance sheet and it wasn’t that long ago where people asking you what you’re doing in equity issuance delevering. I think we’re coming out is this a CapEx spend, you’re starting to take on more projects. How should we think about, as you make decisions on others like Ahafo, Subika and others? Is the target to maintain the current debt level, net debt level, what’s going to dictate your ability to spend on these new projects?
Gary Goldberg:  At this stage the net advantage we have is these aren’t all coming in at the same time and they’re not real large projects in terms of capital, in fact Merian, the largest of the ones we’ve talked about other than Congo which obviously is a bit bigger than those, so we’re going to assess each at the time. Our focus is still going to be looking to deliver these projects from within our own cash flow and operating cash flow from the business, but we can assess at the time, but there’s no intention to either issue more debt or to issue equity to do these, we’re looking to do it from our existing asset business.
Brian Yu - Citi :  Okay, great and then second one, let’s circle back to Indonesia, I know when you guys had gone into arbitration of the Free Port actually struck their MOU, looks like they’re ramping up, number one there’s this change thing over the near term and into your fiscal, continue to proceed with arbitration. Are you guys hoping for a better deal structure than what Free Port was able to get.
Gary Goldberg:  Yes, I think you know the structure that they had and the things they’ve got different issues they were addressing in their changes to their contract at work. We’re having similar discussions with the government around making changes to the contract at work aligned with what both our mine characteristics are and the differences in our contract at work. That said we’re confident in our arbitration case otherwise we wouldn’t have filed it, but we’re really interested in finding a negotiated solution with the government and want to continue down this parallel path to resolve it as soon as possible. 
Gary Goldberg:  Thanks Brian, and we have a couple more questions I’m told.
Operator:  Thank you, next question from Adam Graf, Cowen, your line is open.
Adam Graf - Cowen:  Just a quick question on Long Canyon, I know it’s still preliminary but could you give us the timing of when you guys would breaking ground and then starting first production on phase I for Long Canyon? And then perhaps then talk about how you envision transitioning to phase II?
Gary Goldberg: Yes, at this stage Adam we are still going through finalizing the engineering studies and working to get the permit this year. We bring that one forward early next year for consideration. If we are to make the decision to move forward, we are looking at capital expenditure in the $250 million to $300 million range for that production level and that’s about a five to six year mine life that would have. So it’s during that phase of production that we’d be looking develop phase II and be in a position to have that take on either at the end or slightly before the end of that sort of five to six year mine life. So that’s all still a bit rough and we will get more details as we get through some of those studies and get more certainty around permitting. Operator I think we have one more.
Operator: And our next question, Farooq Hamed, Barclays. Your line is open.
Farooq Hamed - Barclays:  I just had a couple of follow up questions really on some of the guidance that you guys put out and maybe just some housekeeping around that. For ’15 and ’16 you are assuming that you have Batu Hijau export permits back again, what is the production that you are expecting from Batu Hijau for ’15 and ’16?
Gary Goldberg: Well basically what you see in the copper, I am just taking a look at the production numbers and I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me.
Laurie Brlas: [Indiscernible]. There is no change to those estimates; we’re just pushing out by six months for the [indiscernible].
Farooq Hamed - Barclays: Okay, sorry I missed the front part of what you were saying. So you are saying there is no change from what you put out previously.
Laurie Brlas:  The July 1st 8-K which we filed in conjunction with the announcement of the arbitration breaks out the Batu Hijau production and that’s not changed, it’s just pushed back and we can go over that offline if you would like.
Farooq Hamed - Barclays: Sure, okay that’s no problem. Maybe I’ll just follow up in the offline. And then just with regards to 2014 guidance, I know on the call, you said that you are expecting better production from Yanacocha in the second half, I missed the comment about North America. On an overall basis, are you expecting better production in the second half of the year versus the first half?
Gary Goldberg: In North America slightly better, we had but not a very big change because we continue Mexico will help if not having Mexico in the first versus the second half will probably the biggest part driving that through.
Farooq Hamed - Barclays: So you are actually from the America side, you are looking at production both in North and South America in H2.
Laurie Brlas: Yes, yes.
Farooq Hamed - Barclays: Okay, no that’s fair. I just wanted to update my numbers and actually had you guys coming down a little bit in the second half. So that’s helpful. Thanks very much.
Gary Goldberg: Thank you, everyone for joining us. It’s a very pleasing to talk about the results for the second quarter, strong results out in the operations as we continue to deliver our commitments to the market and to our employees and the rest of our stockholders. Very pleased to see Merian is moving forward, one of several projects in organic growth pipeline and I appreciate everyone joining here this morning. Have a good day, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s presentation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for joining.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Jeff Wilhoit - VP Investor Relations Chuck Jeannes - President and CEO Lindsay Hall - Chief Financial Officer George Burns - Chief Operating Officer Russell Ball - EVP Capital Project 
Analysts:  Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank Patrick Chidley - HSBC Greg Barnes - TD Securities David Haughton - BMO Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Alec Kodatsky - CIBC 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp, Inc. 2014 First Quarter Conference Call for Thursday, May 1, 2014. Please be advised that this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you and welcome everyone to the Goldcorp first quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Capital Project. For those of you participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this afternoon’s discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amounts of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and CEO of Goldcorp.
Chuck Jeannes: Thank you Jeff. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us today. Goldcorp’s solid first quarter results underscore what we expect to be recurring themes in 2014; high quality production growth, excellent cost performance and strong progress towards completion of our three current growth projects. Continued execution in these areas positions us very well to deliver long-term value to our shareholder. Gold production in the quarter totaled 679,900 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of a very low $840 per ounce. Adjusted revenues were $1.2 billion with adjusted net earnings of $209 million and adjusted operating cash flow totaled $281 million. It was obviously an active quarter for us from an M&A standpoint with the withdraw of our Cisco bid overshadowing to successful divestures of non-core assets in the form of our share position incremental and our majority interest in the Marigold joint venture. While, I'm disappointed that we didn't get to the finish line on the Cisco deal I am absolutely convinced that we did the right thing in not increasing our offer to a level that we leave us unable to deliver appropriate returns for our shareholders. We have an outstanding portfolio of existing assets and we'll continue to be disciplined in the way we seek to enhance the portfolio going forward. We were please to confirm this morning that we're on track to meet our 2014 production guidance of between $2.95 million and $3.1 million ounces this year which now excludes the forecast of Marigold production. Despite the very low first quarter all-in sustaining cost result, we have maintained guidance for all in sustaining cash costs of between $950 and $1,000 per ounce owing to the somewhat lumpy nature of sustaining capital spending from quarter-to-quarter. We're also maintaining our 2014 capital expenditure guidance of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. As always of course, we're working hard to be more efficient and to minimize capital spending as we go. We've improved our 2014 guidance on two other fronts, DD&A and tax rate, which Lindsay will address in a moment. Looking more closely at our five year growth profile. Forecast gold production growth of approximately 50% over the next two years, will be driven by three new mines coming online starting this year. All three projects remain on track with Cerro Negro just a couple months away from first coal. Just last week Lindsay and I were in Cerro Negro and we witness firsthand the great progress, the team there as may. Certainly expect Cerro Negro to be an outstanding gold mine for us for a very long time. Back in Canada, Eleonore is also advancing very well on schedule and on budget and we expect first gold as planned in the fourth quarter. And finally Cochenour is on track to provide an important supplement to our operations in the world class the Red Lake Camp. Russell will provide a more detail update on all of our projects in a moment. Slide 7, shows were all of these comes together. As we deliver low cost production from the existing lines, complete our capital spending on the new projects, and then see the new gold revenues coming into the picture, the result is free cash flow. Even that in assume $1,200 gold price for the rest of 2014, we expect free cash flow in the fourth quarter this year, the combination is sticking to our proven strategy and remaining discipline in the use of our shareholders capital. And of course, we expect that free cash flow to grow strongly in 2015 and beyond. Before turning things over to George Burns to review the operators. Goldcorp is holding it's Annual General Meeting today in Vancouver, where we expect to welcome Clem Pelletier to our Board of Directors. Clem is a resource industry veteron, both as a mine operator and the founder of an important engineering and environmental firm. Clem has received numerous awards and recognition for industry accomplishments, particularly in the area of environmental consulting. With Goldcorp's commitment to responsible environmental stewardship, Clem will certainly be an important addition to the Goldcorp team. Meanwhile the retirement of Dan Rovig from our Board marks the end of era of sorts, with Dan's leadership in Goldcorp and predecessor company Glamis Gold extending back to 1988. Since 2006, he served Goldcorp's Board with the utmost integrity and distinction and will be truly missed. And with that, I'll turn it over to George Burns.
George Burns:  Thanks Chuck. Our operating teams provided a solid start to 2014, with an emphasis on safe profitable gold production. We continue to build momentum with our operating for excellence focused on cost containment, efficiency and productivity gains in pursuit of targeted cost savings this year. Cost savings are being realized through repartnering with our suppliers. We are also leveraging Goldcorp's growing global purchasing power by entering into alliances with major suppliers. At Red Lake, safe gold production totaled 95,000 ounces for the quarter at an all in sustaining costs of $954 per ounce. Productions affected by lower heading availability in the high-grade zone due to plan destressed activities, which are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2014. Among our operating for excellence successes, the Red Lake team is seeing early benefits of a new shale based approach to mining, with flexible teams organized around specific areas of the mine. We initiated the process in a high grade zone for the end of last year, and we continue to roll it out throughout the mine in 2014. We expect this effort to result in improvements in productivities and efficiencies as well as reduced maintenance costs. Integration of Cochenour and Red Lake continues to be a primary focus and is progressing well. The dedicated team is in place with dual reporting to both operations and projects under our business co-owner model. Russell will add more specific progress on the Cochenour development in a moment. Exploration at Red Lake in the first quarters saw positive results from up punching drilling of a high grade zone which has returned high grades over substantial list. [Technical difficulty] continues to extend zone for higher elevation with the adjacent NXT zone coming into production late this year, drilling there is focused on expanding the zone and converting resources to reserves. At the HG Young exploration target going continues on the intersection of two mineralized structures that have demonstrated multi-ounce great potential. Operations at the Los Filos mine were suspended on April 1, 2014 following the failure to reach an agreement with the Carrizalillo Ejido on terms renew the occupancy agreement that expired on March 31, 2014. We’ve enjoyed the mutually beneficial partnership over the last eight years, negotiations with the Ejido authorities on a new sustainable occupancy agreement continue, and we believe an agreement will be reached. At Peñasquito first quarter safe gold production totaled 129,800 ounces at extremely low all in sustaining cost of $371 per ounce. Plant maintenance led to first quarter average mill throughput 102,448 tonnes per day with expected 2014 throughout to be on track to average a 110,000 tonnes per day. The team is making good progress on delivering efficiency and productivity gains and reducing bottlenecks throughout the operation. The Northern Well Field project is expected to begin construction mid-year with expected completion in mid 2015. We have developed contingency plans for fresh water production to ensure plant production continues as planned for 2014. Finally our Musselwhite team delivered a great first quarter with safe gold production of 74,900 ounces at low all-in sustaining cost of $787 per ounce. We also have an exciting exploration discovery in the West Limb, a new area that has the potential to significantly enhance the future of Musselwhite. With that I’ll turn the call over to Russell for a review of our projects.
Russell Ball: Thanks George. Good day to those on the call. Overall, a good quarter on the project development side. We continued advance our three growth projects and most importantly that progress was achieved safely. The positive trend on progress and safety continued in April. Turning to slide 13, at Cerro Negro in Argentina we remained on schedule for first gold around mid-year. Commissioning efforts are well underway, numerous systems have been [signed out] and transferred operations. We continue to expect to produce between a 130,000 and 180,000 ounces of gold this year. The initial capital cost estimated between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion remains unchanged. We continue to see a tailwind related to the peso devaluation in January. Although this has been partially offset by increased inflation, currently running at between 30% and 35% a year. At the process front the focus has been on driving to first fleet completion and we were approximately 87% completed at the end of the quarter. The commissioning and operating teams are working well together and I believe that teamwork is key to ensuring smoother ramp up to commercial production in the fourth quarter. In terms of mining, the old stockpile at quarter end reached approximately 410,000 tons and average grade 9.8 grams gold and 183 grams to ton silver. Progress in the mine this quarter was negatively impacted by the planned transition to undermining that transition is now behind us. I saw that preliminary month end surveys for April earlier this morning and happy to report that we developed approximately 800 meters above this 765 meters budgeted and the highest monthly development rate ever at Cerro Negro. So hats off to the team on the ground. In addition preliminary cost numbers reflect a significant reduction in development costs per meter. So while we had a challenging quarter due to the planned transition to undermining. We are already seeing the benefits and expect a significant reduction in development costs going forward. Exploration activities remain suspended and we have had a number of positive discussions recently with the provincial leadership and we look forward to resolving our differences and getting back to exploring in Cerro Negro as soon as possible. We continue to believe the District represents one of our best exploration opportunities. On slide 14, the picture show a portion of the temporary generators and related substation located near Marianas mine. In the event that energization of our 132 KV transmission line is delayed, we have a temporary power solution that we believe would still allow us to meet the planned ramp up schedule through roughly the end of August and into maybe September. Slide 15, shows the thickness over to the left and the CCD tank undergoing hydrostatic testing to the right. The plant is coming together nicely and we are excited about the prospect of introducing fees later this quarter. Turning to Éléonore in Quebec on slide 16, initial gold production remains on track for the fourth quarter and in line with our previous initial capital cost guidance of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. We expect gold production of between 40,000 and 60,000 ounces this year and somewhere between 575,000 and 625,000 ounces a year upon ramp up to nameplate capacity currently anticipated to occur in the first half of 2018 although we are evaluating options to accelerate that time. At quarter end engineering on the process plant was essentially complete and construction was approximately 73% complete. Significant progress was made on the support infrastructure including tailings management, space backfill, and order treatment plant and maintenance facility. At the mine the exploration ramp reached 4,688 meters corresponding to a depth of 725 meters below surface and the production shaft is approximately 30% complete at a depth of 735 meters. Stock development has commenced and production drilling is now underway with a small stockpile on surface of approximately 25,000 tons of ore at quarter end. Exploration drilling continues to be focused on the lateral extension of the lower mine with 20,000 meters of underground drilling completed this quarter. We continue to derisk the deposit and look forward to significant resource to reserve conversion at year end based on drill results today. Slide 17, includes a number of recent photos. Conveyors that transport or between the primary and the secondary crushing facilities, carbon regeneration area, a general view of the plants and related infrastructure and the order reclaim area. The spring finally having made its way up to Eleonore, I'm confident that (inaudible) and the team will deliver this world class mine safely and in line with our guidance. Turning to slide 18. At Cochenour, initial gold production remains on track for the fourth quarter, previously disclosed capital costs at $496 million. The shaft reached its final depth of 1,116 meters or roughly 3,600 feet during the quarter and development of the ramp decline to the 4,000 foot level commenced. The haulage drift was approximately 90% complete at quarter end and is on track to be completed in the third quarter. A dedicated integration team was established and is focused on integrating Cochenour into the existing Red Lake operation. In the exploration side, drilling continues on the Bruce Channel deposit with four drills on site at quarter-end and we expect that the 9 drills on site and drilling by the end of the year. Early results confirm the geologic model and we have intersected the deposit right where it was model to gain positive news on that front. Taking a moment to celebrate success and turning to slide 19, in march we made a significant milestone for the project, when we completed the sinking of the shaft. A key component of the mine ventilation system which is a not the critical path for exploration and development at Cochenour. On slide 20, we move to Camino Rojo in Mexico, approximately 50 kilometers Southeast of our Penasquito mine. Following a very successful 2013 drilling program, we announced a significant increase in the resource to almost 12 million ounces. In addition, the metallurgical testing program continues to improve our understanding in this complex, but large and growing ore body and with a dedicated cross functional and no experience study team now in place. We expect to commence the pre-feasibility study in the third quarter. Our final slide covers El Morro a project in Chile that we slowed down in mid 2013 in response to sharply lower metal prices and ongoing legal challenges to our environmental license probably known as the RCA. I am pleased to announce that earlier this week The Court of Appeals in Copiapo in unanimous decision dismissed the three claims that we before. While the court decision as appealable to the Supreme Court we believe this decision is a step forward for the El Morro project. The legal process does not in any way effect our willingness to establish open and transparent dialogue with indigenous communities and other groups close to the project in order for us to be able to develop El Morro in responsible and transparent manner for the benefit of all our stakeholders. With that I will turn it over to Lindsay for this quarter’s financial review.
Lindsay Hall:  Thanks Russell. Financially a real good start to 2012, solid productions from our operations and another quarter of low all-in sustaining costs. Gold sales in the first quarter were 684,000 ounces compared to 725,000 ounces in the prior quarter. Total biproduct cash costs were $507 per ounce compared with $467 in the prior quarter and was below our 2014 annual guidance of between $550 and $600 impacted positively by higher than anticipated biproduct metal sales credits. We realized an average gold price of $1,297 per ounce during the quarter versus the LME’s average above $1,294. All-in sustaining costs for the quarter were $840 per ounce as compared to $810 per ounce in the prior quarter. Excluding Marigold the sale of which was completed shortly after the quarter end our all-in sustaining costs were $828 per ounce for the quarter versus $794 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our annual guidance for all-in sustaining costs of between $950 and a $1,000 per ounce of gold remains unchanged. The details of the all-in sustaining cost calculation are disclosed on page 40 of our MD&A. Reported net earnings for the first quarter amounted to $98 million, while adjusted net earnings totaled $209 million or $0.26 per share compared to $74 million or $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in adjusted net earnings is primarily due to the negative impact of booking the Mexican tax rate change from 28% to 30% in Q4 2013, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the first quarter of 2014. The calculated adjusted net earnings we made the following adjustments to our reported earnings. We deducted the gain on disposition of Primero of $80 million add back to non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $106 million from the book income tax provision as well as the foreign exchange losses on our capital projects of $21 million. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is disclosed on page 42 of our MD&A. Consistent with previous quarters we did not make adjustment to non-cash share based compensation expense which amounted to $24 million or $0.03 per share. The income tax provision included in our reported earnings for the first quarter has an implied tax rate of a negative 8%. The effective tax rate included in our adjusted earnings for the quarter is 8%, which was much less than the anticipated 41%. The difference for the most part results from the tax recovery related to the foreign exchange losses on U.S. dollar denominated debt in Argentina arising from the weakening of the Argentine peso in the quarter and is the primary factor the reduction of our previous effective tax rate guidance of 41% for 2014. Given the favorable tax recovery related to the Argentine foreign exchange losses we are re-guiding the effective tax rate for 2014 to be 26% for the year, which incorporates an effective rate of 36% over the next nine months. Turning to provisional pricing, we had a positive provisional pricing of $4 million of Penasquito and negative provisional pricing of $1 at Alumbrera. Q1, 2014 provisional pricing at Penasquito will reflect 77,700 ounces of gold price at $1,292 per ounce, 4.9 million ounces of silver at $19.97 per ounce, 48 million pounds of zinc, priced at $0.90 per pound and 33 million pounds of lead priced at $0.93 per pound.  While Alumbrera will reflect 20,800 ounces of gold priced at $12.95 per ounce and 16.7 million pounds of copper priced at $3.02 per pound. During the quarter the company generated adjusted operating cash flows of $281 million or $0.35 per share, including in these cash flows as is usual in the first quarter of every year, is the true up of cash taxes at our Red Lake mine, which is operated through a partnership with a January 31st, fiscal year end. The partnership results in 12 months of prior period taxable income being included in the first quarter cash taxable income, which this year amounted to approximately $57 million or $0.07 per share. Basically, we're just recognizing the increase in the cash tax expense and a late reduction in the deferred tax expense that we had been accruing in 2013. We invested $541 million at our operating mines and projects and paid $122 million in dividend this quarter. Of the $541 million, 75% was spending related to our capital projects, $141 million and $202 million at Cerro Negro and Eleonore respectively. Consistent with our portfolio strategy optimization, we disposed of our investment in Primero for a total proceeds of $201 million and successfully closed the sale of Marigold mine to Several Standard Resources on April 4, 2014 proceeds of $188 million. So for the quarter taking our cash flows also dispositions proceeds less the capital expenditures and the dividend payment, there was basically no met movement in our cash position. As noted in our first quarter MD&A, we have updated our full year 2014 guidance for production of between 2.95 million to 3.10 million ounces of gold following the divestiture of Marigold. Deprecation is now expected $350 per ounce lower than our previous guidance of $385 per ounce due primarily to the 2013 fourth quarter impairment at Alhambra and as previously mentioned the overall affective tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 36%. With $2.7 billion of debt representing less than 12% of enterprise value, liquidity of a $2 billion revolver the completion during the coming fourth quarter of a full year new capital spend that will brought on stream three major new mines that will help grow both our gold production to some 4 million ounces and our cash flows, I am very confident that we are financially well positioned. As evidenced by our actions we remain financially discipline on the reinvestment of these growing free cash flows. We are committed to delivering shareholder value while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating ownership. With that I will turn it back to the Paul, the operator for Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs:  Thanks, Chuck, Lindsay, George, Russell and Jeff. Congratulations on a very strong quarter, guys. Just a few questions from me. On El Morro, obviously positive news this week. Chuck, does it sit right behind Camino Rojo now is that being, is there sort of, is that being up in the pipeline for exploration spend?
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks Andrew and good morning as well. It doesn't really change anything in terms of where it sits, it's just another advancement in the project. And unfortunately we expect that there will be another appeal of this resolution. And so we're not through the legal process yet. But as we said at the last Investor Day just few weeks ago, there are new looks at the placement and the nature of the infrastructure at the project that we're undertaking such that we're essentially back in a pre-feasibility study mode at El Morro. And so we'll have to work through that and we'll update there as we get through it.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs:  Right. And just on the portfolio optimization process, are you guys is there any other sort of assets I know you've been quite active this quarter sort of with some divestments. Is there any other assets or investments you think that it could come sort of as we head into the middle of 2014?
Chuck Jeannes:  If there was, I couldn't tell you. Look we as you know have always been active in looking to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and that has been done through both adding new high quality assets and divesting of some non-core assets and we'll continue to look to do that regularly as we always have.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs:  Okay. Lindsay one for you, just on that 106 million bucks, just can you just (inaudible) and just give us little bit more of an explanation, I know it’s not easy to do and it’s hard to forecast is there any sort of more color you can give us on that sort of that unrealized foreign exchange loss?
Lindsay Hall:  Yes, what you are talk about Andrew if I have got year right is that in our reported earnings…
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs:  Yes.
Lindsay Hall:  …is that very lower effective tax cost by like we said we have U.S. nominated loans that we used to funds to build Cerro Negro and with the weakening pace in the quarter in Argentina that creates a loss, tax loss for us in Argentina and we tax affected at the Argentina rate.
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs:  Okay. Yes that makes sense. Thanks guys.
Chuck Jeannes:  Thanks Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead your line is open sir.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Good morning, Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. I guess my question is for Chuck. We potentially saw last week the merger of your number one and two largest competitors in the gold sector and I’m just wondering if what your views are in response to what shareholders are asking of the gold sector now growth has almost become less valued I guess in the last year, whereas per share metrics are increasingly in focus and that does seem to be one of the potential drivers of a mega deal in the gold sector was to drive lower cost and increase earnings per share. So my question is does that change in any way Goldcorp’s thinking in terms of how you could best drive earnings per share growth and maybe take the paddle a little bit off your aggressive growth rate and as the margin shift to perhaps a share buyback strategy, and or increasing of the dividend as that seems to be more of the per share metrics that investors are wanting of gold stock lately.
Chuck Jeannes: Well great question, Jorge thanks. Look all of our efforts have always been focused on growth and improvement on a per share basis. We’ve certainly not been trying to do this on an absolute basis, but it’s always per share. And so if you look at what the combination of this period of spending is bringing us is per share cash flow growth, it’s an improved balance sheet, and it’s this free cash flow that will then allow us to do things like increase the dividend. We’ve been pretty good I think over the course of the last several years and steadily moving dividend up and we did it in a way that was sustainable and then that as soon as the gold price dropped a bit we didn’t have to cut that back and we certainly would look to continue to do that going forward and along with the use of that free cash flow to find other investments to continue to find ways to grow cash flow on a per share basis. So nothing that our peers are doing or might do has anything to do with that overarching strategy and we are going to stick with it.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you and I just also wanted to congratulate you guys on having the discipline to not have taken your bid for a Cisco to appoint where it would have been dilutive on a per share basis.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks, Jorge.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Patrick Chidley from HSBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Hello everybody. Just a question on the Cisco and what the obviously your bit has expire. Can you confirm that you're no longer interested and therefore that's completely out of the picture or if changes to what's going on with the other bit does that have an impact on what you might be thinking?
Chuck Jeannes:  All right. I can predict the future, I fully expect that other bit to close I think that's the common thinking and they will be often running with that assets. So our mines are focused on other things as we described getting these added efficiencies in our operations and bringing the new mines on tracking continuing to look for ways to add value. So our thinking is past that asset at this point.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: And so in terms of looking at forward new acquisition and I guess because of you did bid for Cisco not mean that presumably that you'd be interested in doing something else, if there was something else. Do you think about political risk again here in terms of trying to get something in North America as more of a priority now?
Chuck Jeannes:  No, I think we always said number one, we've always look at the opportunity for acquisitions as they present themselves in the market and we've done a lot of deals over the years. Political risks is one of the factors that we look at and certainly not the only one and we'll continue to use the same prism to analyze opportunities out there and the way that we have in the past.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: So would that better you prefer to look through a cost lane as oppose say political risks, so you could find a better asset in Argentina than you probably go for that versus a low quality asset in North America.
Chuck Jeannes: I wouldn’t draw that conclusion, I just said that political risk is one of the factors. I mean obviously cost and ultimately return on the investments to you shareholders are the key factors and then how you risk adjust those things based on political risk and other things all go into the mix but they are not exclusive of each other by any means.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Okay, all right. Thanks Chuck.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: Yes, thank you. Chuck and/or Russell, your sustaining CapEx, and I recognize it’s lumpy, it’s very low in Q1. But the trend of the past year on a quarterly basis has been dramatically lower. So just wondering what you are doing to achieve that and what you think the correct number on a per ounce basis is going forward?
Chuck Jeannes: Maybe I will start by saying -- I said this before and I just like to repeat it, that I love the all in sustaining cost metric, I think it’s much more representative of the true cost of doing business in our industry. But the thing that everybody needs to understand is that sustaining capital is not spent on a unit basis like per ton or per ounce, it’s spent when this projects happen whether it’s buying a new truck or an engine overhaul or whatever the case maybe. So it just tends to be lumpy based on the way it’s scheduled during the course of the year. Having said that, George and his team on the sustaining capital side and Russell and his team on a project capital side are working extremely hard to find efficiencies wherever we can and reduce that spending. And maybe George, I just pass it over to you to talk a little bit about those efforts that you're looking at in sustaining capital reduction.
George Burns: Sure. So, I mean with the change in metal prices, our focus has been to ensure that sustaining capital makes sense at market prices. So we found opportunities in the last year, basically to cut out lower grade production that couldn't support sustaining capital. So, that's one thing that’s brought sustaining capital down. And then with Russell joining our team, we have a lot bigger focus on our project execution in sustaining capitals part of that. So, being better at executing on sustaining capital, eliminating capital that's really not adding a lot of value to shareholders is where we've seen some benefits. And the other thing I'd add is our operating for excellence focus. We're trying to find ways to do things more efficiently and productively and that includes capital. So, to give you a slight example at Red Lake, we've got a bore hole hoisting project, a sustaining capital project at the bottom of the mine. And in the last six months the team has found more effective way to get ventilation and to get material movement at the bottom of the mine and we're going to cut out some sustaining capital as a result of that. So, we've got everybody focused on.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities: The sustaining capital number this year is around $1 billion. I know production is going up. But do you think that $1 billion number is a per-year, the total number? I know again, Chuck, it's lumpy. Can that level be sustained?
George Burns: So, this is George, we’re not giving a specific number. If you look at Eleonore and Cerro Negro coming on stream. I mean these are underground mines that are going to require additional sustaining development, particularly as we ramp them up. So, in terms of the total number, yes I see that number needing the increase with these growth projects coming into full year production in 2015. But on a per ounce for other sort of unit metrics, I expect that to actually improve because these are higher quality lower cost producers coming on stream.
Russell Ball:  Greg, maybe just adding to that little, if you look at Cerro Negro we had deferred some capital into ‘15, so we’ll have that spend and we're also developing the mine so we have a little bit of that carry over. At Éléonore will only be at 7,000 by the end of ‘17. So you will see another couple of years of significant development, not in a plant but in the underground.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities:  Sure, okay. And then just one more question just switching Lindsay, I know that you drew down 600 million on the line this past quarter and you placed in current debt, I’m just wondering why it’s in current debt, not long term debt?
Lindsay Hall:  Yes, one feature of the convertible line -- revolving line of credit, if I draw down, I can -- we pay it back for 30 days it’s just how it’s structured, so just over quarter end, we did draw money down during March to move it around the various entities we have just to set some loans up between internal organizations. So, we had to keep it outstanding over quarter end, but that 600 million that is drawn from the revolver at March 31 has been refunded shortly after quarter end out of the $1 billion of the cash balance that is at March 31st.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities:  I see, okay. Thanks Lindsay.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Haughton from BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open.
David Haughton - BMO:  Hi yes, hi Chuck and team thank you for the update. Two operational questions possibly for George, the first is one Los Filos. Given that you’ve got the suspension of mining date, can we just assume no production other than whatever happens to the legacy leaching?
George Burns: Yes, so…
David Haughton - BMO: Go ahead. 
George Burns: Sorry David. Yes, essentially we’ve stopped the entire operation, the drain down of the pond has continued. We’ve done some recirculation just to maintain pond levels. So yes, essentially production stopped. And negotiations are ongoing and we’ve got good confidence that we’ll come to a mutually beneficial agreement fairly soon and restart.
David Haughton - BMO: Okay. So, your expectation is that by the end of the quarter you should be able to get back into a producing status with a satisfactory resolution with the Ejidos?
George Burns: For sure. I’d be very disappointed if we don’t settle this by the end of the quarter end. We’re making some progress and good confidence that it’s in the best interest of our Ejido partners and go forward to get this settle quickly.
David Haughton - BMO: Okay. Another question with regards to operation, so far at Peñasquito you seem to come up with some pretty [gauge] in the -- well across board basically and especially in the base metal. Is that something that you would expect to continue with the pace of mining that you’re in at the moment or would you expect some changes through the course of the year?
George Burns: Well if you step back and look at the five year plan, definitely the overall grades of Peñasquito come up and we’re going to sustain those higher grades. There are going to be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as a phase finishes and the next phase gets into the top of the ore body. So you will see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations each year but yes, we’re looking -- we’re in the core of the ore body overall and we’re looking for -- to sustain these sort of grades over the five year plan.
David Haughton - BMO: And sticking with the 110,000 tonnes a day average for the year suggests somewhat about that for the balance of the year and you've got sufficient order to be able to accommodate that kind of throughput?
George Burns:  Yes, that's correct, I mean the first quarter, we had a little bit more maintenance on grinding circuit than normal and we're on track to average that 110 for the year and we do have sufficient water.
David Haughton - BMO: Okay. Thank you very much.
Chuck Jeannes:  Thanks Dave.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning guys or actually afternoon at this point. So just continuing on the Peñasquito question in terms of the strip ratio is that pattern George of sort of getting to the top I think I noticed in the prior first quarter with the 3.3 and top up a little bit to 3. Can we expect that to trend down over the course for the year as well?
George Burns:  Yes. Well, we average three in the first quarter for the year, I’ve to look for that number right now, 3.3 for the year. So you're going to see again some fluctuation in that number, dependent where we're at on the phases of push back.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then in terms of the Red Lake, how do you expect cost to evolve over the course of the year?
George Burns:  All I can tell you is we’re comfortable with our guidance, we have overall the portfolio had a great first quarter and we're comfortable going to hit our guidance that we put out at the beginning of the year.
Chuck Jeannes:  Maybe just to a follow-up on that, if we do the math that means that we do expect as you talked about earlier with the completion of the distress activity, so production will come up a little bit. So on per ounce basis, you'll see those costs come down.
George Burns:  Correct.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: And then just on Musselwhite, the grades are pretty good if you get into linked zone, and you’re actually running quite above the I think the annual run rate there. Do you expect the grades to continue at that level and the tonnage that you put through?
George Burns: We’re focused on that right now. We’ve done some things proactively to reduce dilution, got increased cable bolting going on. And that actually started last year, we’re now seeing the benefits of it. On top of that the link zone, we’re kind of in the heart of that part of links ore body and we’re seeing some positive reconciliation in that area. And that contrasts with last year when we were in this kind of the periphery part of the line zone where the lower grade areas and we were bit disappointed. And so we’re looking at that right now. There is some upside at Musselwhite on grade and stay tuned we’ll update you next quarter.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Sure. And one last question for Lindsay, at (inaudible) will you be receiving a dividend from them?
Lindsay Hall: Hopefully, if they declare one.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: No, I didn’t mean -- basically as you do with your Alhambra and your other equity interest?
Lindsay Hall:  That’s correct. I think what you’re getting at Anita, we haven’t really -- when we explain things to you or the market we proportionally consolidate Alhambra, we won’t do that for (inaudible) with this equity account and take the dividend.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: All right. Thank you.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks Anita.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alec Kodatsky from CIBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.
Chuck Jeannes: Hi Alec.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Just had a quick question on the Northern Well Field, do you have all of the required permitting and regulatory things square way at this point?
Chuck Jeannes: So I mean that’s the reason for the delay and that construction is we were padding up a [few sense] on land agreements and permits and we're confident we're going to have that construction started around mid-year.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Okay. So I was just sort of curious if there is, I would assume with the adjustment in the time lines, you're obviously getting a bit more clarity and feel a bit more comfortable with that. But, just curious if there is anything else outstanding. So that's great, thanks.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks Alec.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting back to Mr. Chuck Jeannes
Chuck Jeannes: Well, thanks very much and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again this summer and updating you on what I'm confident will be strong progress towards all of the objectives we have for the year. So, thank you very much. Good bye.
Operator:  Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and CEO. 
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks Jeff and thanks everyone for joining us today. Those of you who know us well at Goldcorp are aware that one of our highest priorities is on execution delivering on our goals and objectives that we set each year. So I’m pleased to report that we achieved our objectives again in the fourth quarter and for the full 2013 year. We beat up cost guidance on an all-in sustaining and co-product basis and we delivered successfully on gold production guidance due in part to a very strong quarter as we reported in January. Fourth quarter gold production was a record 769,000 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $810 per ounce driven by great operating results at Peñasquito and Red Lake as well as higher throughput at Pueblo Viejo. Our operation for excellence continues improvement initiative (indiscernible) also contributed significantly to bringing down our overall cost as we gained efficiency and productivity improvements across all of our sites. These cost savings help to offset lower than planned byproduct metal prices. With each new (indiscernible) success story we expect further positive contributions to our cost profile in 2014 and beyond. This cost discipline combined with record production drove our adjusted quarterly revenues to $1.2 billion leading to adjusted earnings of 74 million and strong adjusted operating cash flow of $439 million. The reported net loss of $1.1 billion was due primarily to non-cash charges booked to account for new taxes in Mexico and Guatemala as well as the charge at the Alumbrera joint venture due to increased closure costs as it nears the end of it's mine life and lower metal price assumptions.
 : Given all of these accounting adjustments this is definitely one of those times when you need to look straight to the cash flow statements to see the impact of our strong operating performance during the quarter and we were happy to report adjusted operating cash flow of $0.54 per share ahead of consensus expectations. Subsequent to year-end we announced two transactions consist with our strategic focus on portfolio optimization. On January 13, we initiated an offer to acquire Sysco Mining Corporation and last week we announced an agreement to divest the Marigold mine in Nevada. Successful completion of both transactions will result in significant enhancements to what we believe is already a highest quality gold mine portfolio in the business. I would like to comment briefly on our Cisco offer, based on the trading of Goldcorp and Sysco shares in the market since the bid was announced as well as on feedback we have received from many shareholders of both companies. It's clear that our offer for Sysco continues to be well received. We continue to believe that the Canadian Malartic Mine has a higher value based on our premium offer and within Goldcorp’s portfolio of high quality mines than it does on a standalone basis. We’re particularly excited by the opportunity to combine the considerable talents of the Éléonore and Canadian Malartic teams to create a new Quebec focused gold mining champion with a stature and resources for long term success in that excellent jurisdiction. With this in mind we find the Sysco’s decision to proceed with the law suit disappointing as it only serves to deny the Sysco’s shareholders the opportunity to choose for themselves and vote their shares as to the best course for this company. We’re very confident that the legal claims that have been made are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend our offer. In the meantime Sysco has now had sufficient time to explore all reasonable value maximizing alternatives other than what we believe is the best alternative, Goldcorp’s premium offer and it's time to allow us due diligence access. It's frankly bizarre that the only company that has not been granted due diligence is the only one that wants to transact with Sysco. As we have said from the beginning of this process we encourage Sysco’s Board of Directors to engage with us in good faith for the benefit of their shareholders. I’m turning to Goldcorp’s 2013 performance; gold production increased 11% to 2.7 million ounces and in an all-in sustaining cost of $1031 per ounce. The lower cost guidance of a $1050 to $1100 per ounce. Of particular note nearly every mine in the portfolio either met or exceeded production guidance a testament to our focus on execution. Our financial results demonstrate the impact of lower metal prices that have on our overall performance but they also reflect the swift response by our operating teams to the changes we saw in the business during the year. We significantly reduced our spending forecast in mid-2013 and in the year-end we repeat the revised forecast. Our capital spending, exploration expense and G&A. Importantly these changes have not adversely affected our leading growth profile which will include contributions from two important new gold mines in 2014. In response to changing market conditions in 2013 investors have rightly demanded that renewed focus on profitable gold production. While we’re disappointed to break our string of nine consecutive years of increasing gold reserves our 54.4 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves demonstrate strong economics in the current metals market and in fact we saw our overall reserve rate increased by 18%. Peñasquito is a prime example of how a new mine plan that cuts reserves and mine life can actually yield enhanced value and cash flow. We remain bullish on the long term direction of gold prices but our focus on cost containment across our portfolio represents best opportunity for continued success in (indiscernible) gold price environment. Our strategy is unchanged, we’re committed to being a gold focus company and intend on growing safe profitable gold exposure for investors. On that front our plans to deliver two new outstanding gold mines in 2014 remain on track. With Cerro Negro in Argentina scheduled to commence gold production mid-year and Éléonore in Quebec on track for first gold by year end. Our period of intense capital investment is nearing an end. In fact most of our capital spending this year will be front end loaded such that at a flat gold price of $1200 per ounce we expect to generate free cash flow during the fourth quarter of this year. The completion and integration of the Cochenour project will soon follow in 2015 bringing a new source of gold production to Red Lake and an initial capital cost that’s actually decreased from our expectations a year ago. The prospect of growing cash flows coupled with our strong balance sheet provided the confidence to maintain our dividend at $0.60 per share in 2013 when many companies were compelled to cut or cancel dividends. As a our cash flows increase overtime we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation alternatives to maximize shareholder returns while pursuing future growth opportunities. On January 8 we provided new production and cost guidance for 2014 and our updated five year growth profile. Production is expected to increase significantly in 2014 to between 3 million and 3.15 million ounces with all in sustaining costs decreasing to between $950 and a $1000 per ounce. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. Our five year gold production profile remains intact with a forecast increase of approximately 50% over the next two years driven by our three new projects coming online this year. The ramp up of Pueblo Viejo and continued increases in production for Peñasquito. Our five year plan positions us for continued success. With strong production growth combined with continued decreases in all-in sustaining cost we expect to generate increasing cash flows even in a flat gold price environment. We have worked very hard to get to this position and we look forward to delivering sustained value to our shareholders in 2014 and for many years to come. Now I would like to turn the call over to George Burns for a review of operations. 
George Burns: Thanks Chuck and good morning everyone. I’m very pleased with the consorted effort from all corners of our organization that delivered our fourth quarter and full year gold production of 768,900 ounces in 2.67 million ounces respectively. All-in sustaining cost decreased to $810 per ounce for the fourth quarter and $1,031 per ounce for the year both beating guidance. Going forward, we expect further declining cost as we bring our newer lower cost growth projects online. With our Operating for Excellence program building momentum throughout the organization, we will continue to identify and unlock value in the form of greater efficiency, productivity and cost management. Aside from the strong quarterly performances from Red Lake and Peñasquito, Porcupine and Los Filos also delivered strong finishes to 2013. Production of Porcupine was 78,900 ounces in the fourth quarter for a 2013 total of 291,900 ounces. Los Filos production for the fourth quarter was increased 28% from the previous quarter to 94,000 ounces as production bounced back from the third quarter impacted by intense range and flooding of disrupted operations. Production at Los Filos for the year totaled 332,400 ounces of gold. Here is a snapshot of some of the value-creating projects that drove some real cost savings in 2013. This is not an exhaustive list, but it meant to represent the myriad ways our operation teams are using innovation and ingenuity to surface real value. Just one example of Peñasquito, we have been successful in utilizing ultra-high intensity blasting to improve core fragmentation which has led to significant enhancements in productivities and efficiencies. We look forward to sharing more of our operating wins in the year ahead. Some additional detail on our new reserves and resources, the additional drilling at Éléonore has begun to deliver results with gold reserves increasing by 1 million ounces. Los Filos has successfully added 520,000 ounces of gold to reserves. These increases were offset by a decrease at Peñasquito was previously reported while reserves at Pueblo Viejo declined as a result of the effects of the amended SLA agreement and a lower gold price assumption used by Barrick to calculate reserves. Regarding the measured and indicated resources for Éléonore we have reported this morning, I need to point out an error in our reserve and resource table that overstated the measured and indicated resources by 4.03 million ounces. We will be publishing an update later today. Reserves were calculated using a gold price assumption of $1,300 per ounce. The given idea of the sensitivity to changing gold prices at $1,000 per ounce, our reserves would decrease by 16%. On the other hand, using an increased gold price assumption of $1,500, we would see an increase in reserves of 32%. Turning in more detail to operations and beginning with Peñasquito, fourth quarter gold production totaled 141,700 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $473 per ounce. Full year gold production totaled 403,800 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $914 per ounce. Mill throughput during the year averaged 106,200 tons per day as we brought online 12 additional wells and improved efficiencies in the mine primary crusher and the augmented feed circuit. In 2014, we expect to continue to increase throughput to an average of 110,000 tons per day and along with increasing metal grades will contribute to a forecast increase in gold production to between 530,000 and 560,000 ounces for the year. Construction of the Northern Well Field project commenced in the fourth quarter and is expected to add 25 new production water wells by the end of this year. We have also commenced a pre-feasibility study for the tailings facility and a feasibility study is expected to commence in mid-2014. We are also seeing early results of a successful R&D effort to identify additional value at Peñasquito. We are investigating the potential for producing a saleable copper concentrate and also assessing the viability of leaching a pyrite concentrate from the zinc from the zinc flotation tailings. Successful implementation of one or both of these new processes has the potential to significantly improve overall economics and add to the Mineral Reserves through addition of another saleable product and increasing gold and silver recoveries. We expect this pre-feasibility study to be completed by the end of this year. The exploration program at Peñasquito this year is focused on expanding in delineating copper-gold skarn mineralization below and adjacent to the current ore body. Turning to Red Lake fourth quarter gold production totaled a 128,000 ounces and an all-in sustaining cost of $822 per ounce. Full year gold production totaled 493,000 ounces in all sustaining cost of 880 per ounce. Rates increased in the fourth quarter as result of our focus on maximizing cash flows through the optimization of the mine plan to focus on high margin ounces. Full year 2014 gold production is expected to be between 440,000 and 480,000. This slide also continues to focus on significant cost and efficiency improvements. On the exploration front drilling focused on resource expansion and infill drilling of the next zone for multiple horizons through the mine. We converted a small additional resource from Lynx zone from below the 52 level. This year we will continue to focus on expanding the Lynx zone, the hybrid zone at depth in testing other targets around the mine. The first gold production from Cochenour accelerated by six months at the end of this year, the team is hard at work in integrating within Red Lake. As production from Campbell continues to decline the addition at Cochenour is expected to maintain Red Lake at an approximate 500,000 ounce per year produce. In the fourth quarter Goldcorp’s 40% share of gold production at Pueblo Viejo totaled a 104,700 ounces and all-in sustaining cost of $688 per ounce. For the year at gold production to our account was 325,200 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $750 per ounce. The increase in production compared to the third quarter was driven by an increase in (indiscernible) mill following completion of autoclave modifications. The ramp up to fully capacity is expected to occur by mid-2014. The new power plant commenced commercial operations in the fourth quarter which provides the mining with reliable and long term power supply. In summary a strong 2013 and a continued focus on safe profitable production has set the company up for even greater success in the year ahead. I would like to turn the call over to Russell Ball for review of our projects. 
Russell Ball: Thanks George and good day to those on the call. I want to briefly cover the status of our three major growth projects. Collectively are expected to deliver approximately 210,000 ounces to the bottom line in 2014. This is an exciting time at Goldcorp as we get set to deliver production from Cerro Negro by mid-year and Éléonore in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 16, at Cerro Negro in Argentina we continue to make significant progress as we enter the spring in the Southern Hemisphere and conditions improved. We remain on track for production around mid-year with commercial production expected in the fourth quarter and production of between a 130,000 and a 180,000 ounces expected for the year. Initial capital range at 1.6 billion to 1.8 billion remains unchanged notwithstanding the recent Argentine peso devaluation of approximately 25%. We believe that while positive for the initial capital estimate in the short term it is still too early to quantify the impacts of the devaluation given the uncurtaining of future inflation rates in country. We will obviously be watching the situation closely. At process plant the EPCM scope is approximately 78% complete with engineering essentially complete. On the construction side in addition due to better weather we are seeing better productivity from the more skilled craft such as electrical, piping and instrumentation and that has help drive progress over the last quarter. We have ran three feet through the primary crushing circuit and look forward to that circuit being turned over operations later this month or in early March. The commission came in place and are focused on ensuring a smooth transition from construction to operations. Turning to the mine, the ore stockpile at year-end was approximately 285,000 tons at an average grade of 10.5 grams per ton gold and 206 grams per ton silver. To supplement our underground ore feet [ph] and provide the metal with additional flexibility. We commenced the modest surface mining operation in the fourth quarter. While lower grades this material will provide additional flexibility in the event of any unplanned disruption at the mines and as we explore the opportunity to increase mill throughput beyond the design rate of 4,000 tons per day. Slide 17 includes some recent progress photos. The plant is coming along nicely as you can see on the two pictures on the left, another photo show that first ore being stockpiled at the primary crusher in the surface mining operation at Eureka with a vein on our surface. Turning to Éléonore in Quebec on Slide 18, initial gold production remains on track for Q4 this year with between 40,000 and 60,000 ounces expected in 2014 and commercial production expected to occur in the first quarter of 2015. Initial capital estimate remains unchanged at between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. At year end, the engineering for the process plant was 97% complete and process plant construction was 58% complete. Infrastructure saw the completion of the SLA on dry facilities, the addition of 400 rooms to the permanent camp and the structural completion of the water treatment plant buildings. At the mine, the exploration ramp progressed beyond 4,300 meters and the production shaft reached a depth of 700 meters. We achieved a key milestone in January of this year. When we connected the exploration decline with the 710 level and the shaft space showing the 650 meter level aligned for improved safety with additional emergency exits, better material movement and additional ventilation, which should set us up well to deliver in 2014. On the exploration side, we completed over 90,000 meters of diamond drilling with a focus on infilling the upper mine. Drilling towards the end of the year focused on the lower mine with additional emphasis in the fourth quarter on the 494 zone conceptual target and the hanging wall structures in the upper mine. As a result of the upper mine infill program, we were able to report an increase in reserves of 1 million ounces or 33% to 4 million ounces. Slide 19 did include the number of recent photos. As you can see, the majority of the workrooms are now closed and we continue to make good progress in the winter months. Unfortunately, due to late design changes, the construction in the primary crushing related infrastructure was not completed before winter. So we are paying the price to constructing the open during winter, which presents some safety challenges in increased cost to lower productivity. And finally turning to Slide 20 at Cochenour in the Red Lake, the revised development plan was approved in the fourth quarter at lowest capital by $44 million to $496 million and which accelerates development by approximately six months to the end of 2014. The project team is executing on the revised plan and the focus now is on fully integrating Cochenour into the existing Red Lake and Campbell operations. At year end, the shaft slashing or widening had reached the depth of 1,041 meters and remains on track for completion in April this year. The Cochenour, Red Lake haulage drift was approximately 86% complete. Since it is no longer on the critical path, completion date has been pushed to October 2014 as resources are redeployed to focus on inclined development and ventilation. In the exploration side, drilling of the Bruce Channel deposit from two drilling stations off of the haulage drift continues with additional drills scheduled to be added as additional drill bays on development. As you can see, we have a big year ahead of us with the completion of two new outstanding mines. I am confident our teams are up for the challenge and we are all looking forward to seeing the first gulf ports at Cerro Negro and Éléonore later this year. With that, I will turn it over to Lindsay for a discussion of this quarter’s financial results. 
Lindsay Hall: Thanks Russell. As you heard from George or Russell, we ended up 2013 meeting our production and now all-in sustaining cost targets building on improvements experienced in the third quarter. We sold over 725,000 ounces of gold at an average realized price of 1,250 per ounce. Byproduct cash cost also includes $467 per ounce compared to the prior quarter of $551 per ounce primarily due to higher sales volume for gold and higher byproduct credits. From a finance and reporting perspective as anticipated, a number of events occurred, which resulted in a reported net loss for the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion or $1.34 per share compared to net earnings of $5 million or $0.01 per share in the prior quarter. Included in the fourth quarter results are non-cash deferred tax charges of $763 million and $443 million of impairment charges. The tax charges of $763 million related primarily to the recognition of future impacts of taxation changes on the company’s investment in mining interest in Mexico. Although effective for January 1, 2014 as these tax changes were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2013, charges have been recognized in the fourth quarter reported net loss. Of the some 664 million impact arising from the Mexican tax reform 516 million relates to the impact of the new 7.5% mining royalty on EBITDA and the balance of a 148 million is from the impact of corporate income tax rates increasing from a planned 28% to 30%. In Guatemala effective for 2014 we elected to pay income taxes on a net income basis in Guatemala rather than in a gross revenue basis which resulted in a deferred income tax charge of some 80 million arising from recognizing book to tax differences. This election should be a positive to our cash cost respectively and we would have paid under the old method. While accounting charges are significant all of this accounting was contemplated and we gave our effective income tax rate guidance for 2014. Of the total impairment charges of 443 million, 276 million relates to our investment in Alumbrera. We also recorded a charge of 86 million due to the recently announced sale of our interest in the Marigold mine. As a result of the announced sale Marigold has been reported as a discontinued operation in our financial statements but continues to reflected as part of the Company’s key performance indicators and in the close of the transaction. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter amounted to 74 million or $0.09 per share. Note that of the total 763 million of deferred tax charges recognizing the fourth quarter we have adjusted from our reported net loss 615 million related to the Mexican, Argentinian and Guatemalan tax changes. The impact of the Mexican tax rates remain at 30% rather than the previously anticipated reduction to 28% on our deferred income tax liabilities and assets of a 148 million or $0.18 per share remains in adjusted earnings as the Company has not historically adjusted for tax rate change impacts. The calculated adjusted net earnings in addition to the tax charges we adjusted our reported net loss by the following significant adjustments. Non-cash impairment of mining interest totaling 443 million net of tax, non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities of 67 million from the book tax provision and loss in disposition of certain of the equity investments of 8 million. Unrealized losses on derivative instruments of 40 million and a non-cash provision related to the increase in estimates on the reclamation and closure cost of Company’s inactivity and closed mines 17 million. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is disclosed on page 48 of our MD&A. Consistent with previous quarters we did not make any adjustments to the non-cash share based compensation expense which amounted to 8 million or $0.01 per share. While adjusted net earnings decreased in Q4, 2013 compared to Q3, 2013 primarily due to the recognition of the 148 million Mexican tax rate change impact, how do we ignore that non-cash charge impact to our quarter. Our quarter-over-quarter financial performance improved. The income tax provision included in our calculated adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 as an implied effect of tax rate of 92% as it includes the 148 million impact of the Mexican corporate rate changes. To calculate the 92% effective rate, the book tax provision of 788 million for the quarter is adjusted for the foreign exchange losses on deferred taxes of 67 million. The tax impact, the Mexican, Argentinian, Guatemalan tax 615 million and the tax recovery of 26 million related to the impairment expenses recorded. Then from the loss before tax the following adjustments are made. Add back the impairment of mining interest of 383 million, the impairment of marketable securities of 17 million and deducted revisions and estimates on asset requirement obligation inactive of closed mine sites up 25 million. The higher fourth quarter tax rate was primarily due to the effect of the Mexican corporate tax rates remaining at 30% of a 148 million rather than the anticipated reduction to 28%. Excluding that impact the implied effective tax rate will be 16% which is lower than our guidance of 25% primarily due to the unanticipated positive tax effects of foreign exchange losses. Turning to provisional pricing, we had a negative provision pricing of 2.5 million and 1 million at Peñasquito and Éléonore respectively. In Q1, 2014, provisional pricing at Peñasquito will reflect 75,000 ounces of gold priced at $1,205 per ounce, 4.2 million ounces of silver at $19.50 per ounce, and 36.6 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.95 per pound and 34.5 million pounds of lead priced at $1 per pound. While in Alumbrera, it will reflect 5,100 ounces of gold priced at $1,206 per ounce and 8.5 million pounds of copper priced at $3.34 per pound. In spite of lower metal prices, the company continued to generate strong cash flows from operations with adjusted operating cash flows for the third quarter of $439 million or $0.54 per share compared to $374 million or $0.46 per share in the Q3, 2013. The increase in adjusted operating cash flows was primarily due to higher revenues from higher sales volumes. We invested $594 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid $121 million in dividends this quarter. For 2013, capital investments totaled $2.3 billion which is below our full year 2013 guidance of $2.6 billion due primarily to the timing of expenditures. Continuing strong cash flows and well-managed capital investments are part of the Goldcorp’s well-established goal of financial discipline. With $625 million in cash and undrawn revolver facility of $2 billion, we continue to be very comfortable in our ability to fund our capital programs both in our operating mines and new projects under the current gold price scenario. At the end of 2013, our strong balance sheet, flexible expenditure program and continued focus on cost containment through our O for E program allows us to continue to positively impact our financial results and add value for our shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to the operator. 
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Hall. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: Jeannes thanks very much for the update today. Congratulations on a good quarter and a strong FY ‘13. Just one question on Cerro Negro costs, I suppose there is no sort of clarity on it yet, just sort of question what would be the portion that would be in say the peso versus say U.S. dollar just of operating cost, just sort of rough idea? 
Chuck Jeannes: Andrew, you are talking on operating costs or? 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: Yes, yes, operating cost going forward. So when we sort of get underway, would you guys have any idea what that would be? 
Chuck Jeannes: I think it’s in the range of 60 to 80. We are still working through some of the contracts that while denominated in Argentinean pesos are indexed to a dollar, particularly for international commodities, but I think 60 to 80 remembering that a big portion of that is in the labor cost. 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: Yes. So that will be about 35, 40ish or something? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, labor cost running around 40 to 45 including contractors. 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. And Chuck, maybe can you just look obviously we are very close to this growth profile now, what would be your most interesting development project after these three add a little bit? 
Chuck Jeannes: It’s a good question to rank the kids, but I would say the thing that we are probably spending the most time on right now is Comino Rojo. I saw very large increase in resource there to over 10 million ounces of gold. We are doing a lot of metallurgical work right now and we plan to start kind of kickoff our pre-feasibility study here in a couple of months. At the same time, the Deep Peñasquito is looking very interesting as well. And the excitement around that is that we know that once we mine out the existing reserves, we will have free strips for that start deposits that we are developing underneath. So lot more work needs to be done there, but I would say if I had to rank them, those would be the two that are highest right now. 
Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much guys. 
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from (indiscernible) with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. I just want to give an update I know when you announced your Cisco deal, you guys talked about your commitment to current ratings, we did see S&P come out of negative on the proposed offer and no action you had from Moody’s and Fitch but at least Moody’s indicated that they felt there was limited room for increased cash components of the bid. So I just would like to get a sense for how you’re thinking about that as you consider on Sysco and whether or not you think you’ve room to raise your cash offer potentially or whether you think the ratings are sort of a constraint on your ability to do so? 
Chuck Jeannes: As we have said in the past we like the discipline that our commitment to investment grade ratings provides in terms of the way we manage our cash and debt levels and we will continue to do that, there is a lot of room in those ratings of course and as you just pointed out we got different near term views from both S&P and Moody’s and I would just say back to the Sysco deal we think we have made a very fair and appropriate offer and until or unless we see something else there is no reason to talk about changing that. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then in terms of if I could just ask maybe if you’re willing to put a finer point on that ratings commitment is it to investment grade, is it mid BBB which is sort of where you’re currently? 
Lindsay Hal: We’re committed to strong investment grade ratings and as you saw from both Moody’s and S&P they are very supportive of us, Moody didn’t change anything and S&P looked at it and said maybe we will watch them, work through the Sysco bid but they are both very supportive and we’re both very committed to those high investment grade ratings. 
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: First off thanks for the open pit and processing cost per ton disclosure as by quarter-by-quarter that’s great and then my next question is a question I’ve been asking all the companies, when you were estimating your reserves what cost are you using to determine the cutoff grade? 
Chuck Jeannes: First Anita your welcome for the per ton detail. We have always tried to be very transparent and we listened and overtime we improved the reporting as we go. So, in terms of the cost I’m going to pass that over, obviously we use what is in our budget for our current operating cost plans and sustaining cost plans based on our best knowledge today. I guess I’m not sure exactly where you’re going with. 
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: You’ve heard people companies come out talking about fully loaded cost and it's going to seem sort of you know with the move from going even total cash cost all-in sustaining cost. The focus has been short of on sustaining capital and I’m just wondering have you pushed the sustaining capital to you reserve estimate as well. 
Chuck Jeannes: Yeah as I just said we absolutely include sustaining capital in our reserve estimates, yeah. 
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: And in terms of overhead, any corporate overhead as well that’s been pushed or is it just the G&A that’s included? 
Chuck Jeannes: No and we actually it's important to us we do not push G&A down to the sites [ph], we want them to be valued and based as businesses and we picked we keep that corporate G&A at our level. 
Operator: Thank you and the next question is from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. 
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research: Should we expect was the cash coming in 2015, ’16, ’17 now that everything is built the Goldcorp will return to a net cash position in a very conservative robust manner or moving forward do you expect to have something like a 30% debt to capital ratio like manufacturing companies where you use a little bit of leverage to amplify return on equity. 
Chuck Jeannes: I think we feel very clearly that we don’t want to be up into that 30% debt equity ratio and let’s look at what’s happened in our business over the last several years. We have been conservative with the balance sheet. We have stayed down in the teens or even below in terms of our debt to equity and others that have been a little bit more aggressive as soon as the gold price dropped saw stress on the balance sheet. And that’s something we don’t want to do. So recognizing that we are in a business that our revenues cannot be controlled or at least we choose not to control them by hedging. We are going to be more conservative than you might see in manufacturing or other sector in terms of the amount of leverage that we use to try to goose those returns on equity. So we talked about that a lot. We are very clear on it and you won’t see us go there. 
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research: So we don’t have to think about Goldcorp having as much debt as Newmont although it might be for a couple of quarters the same as AngloGold? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, I don’t have the numbers of the others ahead of us, but as Lindsay has explained and I have, we are committed to staying strong investment grade and we don’t like the idea of taking that debt to equity ratio up any further. 
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research: Okay. 
Chuck Jeannes: Nice John. 
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Kenneth Hackel with CT Capital. Please go ahead. 
Kenneth Hackel - CT Capital: Thank you so much. Could you discuss the 2015 estimate for capital spending or a range of that? And also second question is with regard to operating risk in Argentina and capital controls use the local labor etcetera? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes. Sorry, just to make sure I understood you were asking the 2015 guidance for capital spending? 
Kenneth Hackel - CT Capital: Yes, that’s correct, because we based our analysis on free cash flows and the big wildcards it’s not so much whether gold goes up or down by $50 an ounce, but the capital spending budget? 
Chuck Jeannes: Right. And we don’t provide specific guidance beyond the current year and we have guided for this year at $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. I can tell you that we expect that number to come down very dramatically in 2015, because... 
Kenneth Hackel - CT Capital: Well, why don’t you could provide us with a range then? 
Chuck Jeannes: I just said we don’t provide guidance. I am trying to give you some color, because we – as we said earlier are going to be complete in our development and construction spending for Cerro Negro and Éléonore, those big numbers will come off. So if you start at the base, we look at sustaining capital for our current business in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion per year. That’s going to come out the door every year, no matter what, just to sustain the existing mines and replace trucks and do the kinds of things that you need to do at an existing operation. If you add a few bucks for developing and advancing things like Comino Rojo and other capital spending like an El Morro, you can envision yourself getting up into a couple of hundred million more, but not much. 
Kenneth Hackel - CT Capital: Okay. Well, so you are talking about $1.5 billion that would be real explosive in free cash flow. What about with regard to operating issues in Argentina capital controls, use of local labor, etcetera removing currency out of the country and so on? 
Lindsay Hall: Yes, Kenneth, it’s Lindsay Hall. I can say as an investor in Alumbrera, we are moving our money out, so that doesn’t seem to be a concern as you know or maybe you don’t know in Argentina as well as we register our investment is with the Central Bank getting our interest and our debt repayments out and dividend payments out certainly don’t – shouldn’t be a concern to us. We haven’t seen it on Alumbrera, so we don’t expect it at Cerro Negro. And certainly with we are seeing some movement as you can well imagine with the peso devaluating a bit, which is positive for the project, but we remain cautiously optimistic of one thing that will get much better than Argentina, but we will wait for that to happen once we get into operations. Russell, any… 
Russell Ball: Yes, we have managed around the foreign currency issues. It has complicated the construction undoubtedly, but we are seeing relief on some of those restrictions with some of the recent announcements. So I think it’s fair to say the road ahead maybe a little easier as far as importing with some of the restrictions being relaxed. So we look forward to that quite frankly. 
Kenneth Hackel - CT Capital: What about restrictions regarding use of the local labor, purchase, purchasing etcetera? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, this is Chuck back to the beginning, that did hurt us quite a bit in terms of the capital costs and productivity in building Cerro Negro, because those restrictions very much limited our ability to bring material from outside the country and we had to source it inside at whatever cost. And so the cost went up as you might expect, I think the examples that I have used in the past year is that we had pricing from outside Argentina for our structural steel and then ended up paying almost 400% when we had to source it more than we had planned when we had to source it in country. So those kinds of things though are largely behind us because number one we have now imported nearly everything we need to construct and startup the mine and two as Russell Ball just said they are starting to loosen some of those foreign control so we look for this to improve going forward. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the meeting back to Mr. Jeannes. 
Chuck Jeannes: Well thank you very much everyone. I appreciate you taking the time. As you’ve heard from all of us I think we’re very excited about the year ahead and we remain focused on operating our mine safely. Continuing to reduce our costs and of course delivering our three new growth projects on schedule and on budget. So we look forward to updating you as our progress advances over the course of the year. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Thank you. The conference call has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc. 2013 Third Quarter Results Conference Call for Thursday, October 24, 2013. Please be advised this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you and welcome everyone to the Goldcorp third quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Capital Management. For those of you participating on the webcast we’ve included a number of slides to support this morning’s discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks Jeff and thanks everyone for joining us today. I am pleased that we were able to report solid third quarter results for Goldcorp this morning with gold production on track with our original guidance for the year. More importantly nearly every mine delivered decrease in costs quarter-over-quarter as our productivity and cost reduction programs continued to take hold throughout the organization. For the quarter gold production totaled 637,100 ounces, while all-in sustaining costs decreased to $992 per ounce. This contributed to adjusted net earnings for the quarter of $190 million or $0.23 per share, while adjusted operating cash flow totaled $375 million or $0.46 per share. As we’ve discussed previously grades and production at Peñasquito increased in the third quarter as we expected and we also saw improved recoveries and throughput in the quarter. We are positioned for a strong fourth quarter at Peñasquito as mining has moved into a higher grade portion of the pit. Water availability was as expected and the team has continued to advance the Northern Well Field project to help meet our longer term water needs at Peñasquito. Looking ahead production remains on track to meet 2013 guidance with continued cost reduction a key priority for the balance of the year and beyond. Porcupine in Ontario is a mine that deserves special mention for their recent and dramatic success in reducing costs. As most of you are aware the porcupine complex is one of Goldcorp’s higher cost operations and they have responded to our operating for Operating for Excellence or ore for – challenge with initiatives designed to position the mine for free cash flow on a sustained basis. These types of porphyry stories about throughout the organization and we look forward to seeing that momentum building and manifesting itself directly in our financial results. Red Lake in Ontario delivered a lower production quarter as mining took place in lower grade blocks as planned. As is often the case at this high grade mine we are seeing a lot of variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis but overall Red Lake production remains on track to achieve 2013 guidance of between 475,000 and 510,000 ounces. De-stressing activity is proceeding successfully positioning the mine for strong finish to 2013 and a solid start to 2014. Autoclave modifications at the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic are now essentially complete and efforts continue to de-bottleneck the plants and position PV for an improved 2014. Due to these ramp up issues we now expect PV production to come in at the low end of our guidance range for the year. Turning to the projects I remain very pleased with the pace of construction and development at the Éléonore Gold Project in Quebec. Éléonore remains on track for first gold production in late 2014 and we look forward to what would be a very strong contribution to our production growth and low cost profile. Cochenour in Red Lake has continues to progress towards first production in 2013. Plans to integrate the project into existing Red Lake operations are accelerating, supporting our long term vision for robust high grade production from this world class camp for many years to come. Turning to Cerro Negro the team there continues to make good progress on development despite significant external challenges. An initial delay and receiving the necessary permits delayed the start of construction of the main power transmission line by six months. Annual inflation of 25% to 30% continues without a corresponding decline in the Argentine peso rate applying pressure on costs. We are also dealing with uncertainty related to the recently enacted resource tax imposed by the Santacruz province. These issues have prompted us to cease all exploration activity and to defer the developments of the Mariana Norte vein until late 2014. We today announced a revised schedule and capital cost estimate for Cerro Negro with first gold production expected in mid-year 2014 and the gold production for the year now expected in the range of 130,000 to a 180,000 ounces. The initial capital cost estimate is increased to between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. In the mean time we’ll continue to engage at the provincial and the federal levels in Argentina to see constructive solutions to the challenges before us at Cerro Negro. Based on our strong production results through three quarters we are pleased to be able to reconfirm and narrow the ranges on our 2013 production and cost guidance. Production is expected to be between 2.6 million and 2.7 million ounces a total cash cost of between a $1,050 and $1,100 per ounce on an all-in sustaining basis, $550 to $575 an ounce on a by-product basis and $700 to $725 per ounce on co-product basis. Capital spending remains on track with previously reduced guidance of $2.6 billion for the year. In summary production for the quarter puts us on track to meet guidance for the year. I am sure you’ve done the math and you can see that, that means we are expecting a very strong fourth quarter consistent with our discussions with you throughout the year. This higher production in combination with operating cost moving lower throughout the portfolio means we are looking forward to a very strong finish to 2013. Looking forward to 2014 we are in the midst of our budgeting process and we’ll be providing the details for you in early January. So I don’t have any numbers for you yet but I can say that we certainly expect significantly higher production and lower all-in sustaining cost in 2014. From a broader perspective the Goldcorp Investment preposition remains intact. Our strong balance sheet, growing production and low cost operating structure enabled us to continue to both fund our outstanding growth profile and return capital to our shareholders. With that I’d now like to turn the call over to George for a review of the operations.
George Burns: Thanks Chuck. Gold in the third quarter was largely as expected across the mine portfolio while all-in sustaining cost decreased at 9 of the 11 operations compared to the second quarter. We continue to see wins from our Operating for Excellence program that translated into direct cost reductions in the third quarter. Turning to the operations and beginning with Peñasquito, third quarter gold production totaled a 113,900 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $830 per ounce. Mill throughput in the quarter averaged approximately a 109,900 tons per day with water availability in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress in our efforts to secure the water requirements for Penasquito. Northern Well Field land access agreements continue to be completed throughout the quarter and we are finalizing the pipeline routing. Final engineering designs are essentially complete. Construction activities are expected to commence during the fourth quarter of this year. Production at Porcupine for the quarter totaled 76,000 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $920 per ounce, the lowest cost at Porcupine since the fourth quarter of 2011. Increased production over the second quarter of this year was a result of optimization of long-hole sequencing at the Hoyle Pond to remove marginal production, higher grades at the Dome Underground and higher tonnage from stockpile. At Hollinger project the environmental compliance approval for Hollinger is expected to be issued by the Ontario Minister of Environment before year-end. A new optimized mine plan has been developed to support a much stronger economic project at lower gold prices and accomplishes reclamation of historic mining activities. At Red Lake, gold production totaled 97,000 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $986 per ounce. Production decreased as compared to the second quarter as mining took place in the lower grade blocks in the 41 and 45 levels. Rates in the high grade zone Deep Campbell and Horizon are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. De-stressing of this 47-46 level is well underway and the team at site continues to progress to de-stress cuts more quickly and efficiently. We remain on track to meet guidance of between 475,000 and 510,000 ounces. Our 40% of gold production at Pueblo Viejo totaled 75,400 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $661 per ounce. Lower tonnage was processed compared to the prior quarter as one of the autoclaves was taken off line for design modifications. All four autoclaves have now been modified in each successfully tested at design capacity of 300 tons per hour. However, as a result of ongoing modifications in other areas of the plant, production for the year is expected to be at the low-end of our guidance. Construction of 215 megawatt dual fuel power plant is essentially complete and in the commissioning phase which will run into November. You’ve heard me talk about our Operating for Excellence program all year and I am very pleased that a lot of hard work is showing up in the numbers. Our teams are focused on many additional opportunities that will deliver improvements in efficiencies in productivities and reduction in operating costs as we move forward. Now I would like to turn the call over to Russell Ball for review of the projects.
Russell Ball: Thanks, George and good day everyone. Turning to slide 14, you can see we made significant progress in Cerro Negro in Argentina despite a challenging external environment. As I mentioned on the second quarter call we made a conscious decision not to change schedule at any cost and that has resulted in our revised schedule and capital cost information. We now expect to produce first gold in mid-2014 with commercial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2014 and gold production for the year 2014 between 130,000 and 180,000 ounces. Our revised capital cost estimate is expected to be between 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion, up from the previous 1.35 billion. At the end of the third quarter we had spent approximately $933 million so we have about another $800 million to be spent in the fourth quarter of this year and next year through commercial production. At the process plant the EPCM scope is approximately 66% complete with engineering in excess of 96%. The ore stockpile at quarter end was approximately 157,500 tons at an average grade of 12.4 grams gold and 253 grams per ton silver. Due to the delay in plant startup we expect the stockpile to be approaching 450,000 tons by the middle of 214 increasing to approximately 550,000 tons by the time we expect to reach commercial production. Consequently and in order to be disciplined with our capital we have temporarily suspended development at Mariana Norte. As previously discussed due to recently enacted resource tax in Santacruz province all exploration activities were suspended in the third quarter. Cerro Negro remains one of our highest exploration priorities and we look forward to resumption of exploration activities following resolution of the resource tax issue. Slide 15 provides more detail on our revised schedule and updated capital cost estimate. The risk identified in prior quarters have negatively impacted the schedule and we now expect the porphyry in mid-2014 rather than late 2013 primarily as a result of six months delay in receipt of approval of the permit to construct a transmission line, which shifted the construction period into the winter. The current schedule has completion of transmission line appearing in February 2014. In regards to increase in the capital cost estimate the major drivers were as follows; approximately $170 million related to escalation in the exchange rate and in particular the significant difference between the official exchange rate and the unofficial exchange rate. The difference between the two rates is currently around 17%. The previous capital cost estimate had assumed that inflationary impact will be offset by an equivalent depreciation in the exchange rate. And clearly that has not been the case. In addition the 1.35 billion estimate had no inflation assumed for 2014 since the expectation was that we would be essentially complete at the end of 2013. Approximately 100 million related to the schedule delay with the extension of the expected commercial production date which results in operating costs being capitalized and getting hung up on the balance sheet which is going through the income statement. Approximately 80 million related to regulatory changes requiring greater in-country sourcing and contractor productivity challenges. And finally an increase in $25 million in contingency to a reflected challenging environment in which the team is operating with approximately 20 % of the remaining spend in contingency which is high at this stage of the project but we feel is prudent based on recent experience. Key assumptions embedded in this revised capital cost estimate including country inflation of 25%-30% continuing for 2014 and a six to one Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar exchange rate. Clearly a meaningful devaluation of the peso between now and construction completion would significantly improve the capital cost estimate. Slide 16 reflects some of the significant progress in the field and I wanted to recognize the dedication and commitment of the entire team on the ground to safely constructing Cerro Negro. With the mill building now enclosed in the southern hemisphere, summer approaching we look forward to significantly higher progress in the coming months. Turning to Eleonore in Quebec on slide 17 initial gold production remains on track for the fourth quarter of 2014. At quarter end the engineering for the process plant was 91% complete, and the EPCM progress was at 40%. At the mine the exploration ramp progress beyond 3,600 meters and the production shaft reached a depth of 525 meters. The geologists on the call you will be happy to know that we achieved a milestone during the quarter when on August 18th we intersected the first mineralized zone and cross cut on level 410. Drilling this quarter focused on infill, in filling the upper mine area and exploration in the lower mine area with just in excess of 17,000 meters of diamond drilling completed in the quarter with currently six drills onsite. Slide 18 includes a number of recent photos of the mill building and as you can see the team is making significant progress. The mill building has been winterized which will make for higher productivity as winter in Northern Quebec rapidly approaches. And finally turning to slide 19 at Cochenour in the Red Lake district construction activities are on schedule and on budget with production on from the 5100 level currently expected in the first half of 2015. However, as part of this year’s budget process the Red Lake operation teams are looking at opportunities to improve on that schedule and we will keep you informed as that process is finalized. At quarter end the shaft slashing and widening has reached a depth of 930 meters and remains on track for 2014 completion. The Cochenour Red Lake haulage drift was approximately 80% complete. The progress was slow this quarter due to a tap zone that extended for approximately 2,400 feet. We are now out of the tap and expect to see significantly higher rates of advance shortly. Of the detailed schedule review the haulage drift is no longer on the critical path and as such we are looking at options to re-deploy resources, to focus on mineralization raises, as the mine working areas is now the critical path. On the exploration side we recently commenced drilling from the drilling the Bruce Channel from a cut off of the haulage drift. With that I will now turn it over to Lindsay for this quarter’s financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks, Russell. We sold over 652,000 ounces of gold at an average realized price per ounce of $1,339 versus 624,000 in the second quarter at an average realized price of $1,358. By product cash cost also improved to $551 per gold ounce compared to the prior quarter of 646 primarily due to higher byproduct credits and higher sales volume for gold as well as a 2% decrease in production cost as the company continues to focus on implementing cost savings and productivity gains as part of its Operating for Excellence initiatives across the organization. On the co-product basis cash cost decreased to $706 per ounce in Q3 compared to $713 in the prior quarter. The increase in sales volume and reduction in production cost resulted in an increase to our earnings from mine operations of some $68 million from the prior quarter. As well our Q3 all-in sustaining cost decreased to $992 and remained in line with our narrowed 2013 guidance range between the $1,050 and $1,100 per ounce. This decrease as compared to our Q2 cost of $1,279 is primarily a result of company’s management of the sustaining capital program to maximize returns on capital employed. The details of this calculation are disclosed on page 38 of our MD&A. Net earnings for the third quarter amounted to $5 million or $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $1,934 million per share of 238 in the prior quarter. The third quarter results were impacted negatively by the cumulative tax adjustments arising from the amendments for the Pueblo Viejo Special Lease Agreement or SLA which was ratified just prior to the close of the quarter. The cumulative negative impact which is included in the share of net losses and associates line of the GAAP statement amounted to $187 million with 26 million related to the third quarter earnings of Pueblo Viejo. The remaining $161 million relates to the retroactive impact of the amendments. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter amounted to $190 million or $0.23 per share compared to $117 million or $0.14 per share in the prior quarter. To calculate adjusted earnings we adjusted our reported net earnings of $5 billion by adding back retroactive impacts of the Pueblo Viejo SLA amendments of 161 million and foreign exchange losses related to our capital projects of 12 million. The we removed the effect of the non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $9 million from the booked tax provision. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is disclosed on page 39 of our MD&A. Consistent with previous quarters we did not make any adjustments to non-cash share based compensation expense which amounted to 24 million or $0.03 per share. To calculate the effective tax rate for the quarter one needs to adjust the book income tax recovery of 10 million for the following items. Increased recovery for the foreign exchange losses and deferred income tax assets and liabilities of 9 million and deduct the income tax expense related to the third quarter earnings of PV of $33 million and Alumbrera of 7 million. Then from the loss before tax of 5 million the following adjustments are made. Add back the book income tax expense included in the equity earnings of PV and Alumbrera of 205 million and 24 million of stock based compensation representing permanent differences as these items will never be taxable resulting in an effective tax rate of 10% for the quarter. This lower third quarter tax rate is due primarily to the settlement of certain past tax positions and the favorable impacts of tax deductible Argentinean foreign exchange losses. The company expects an overall effective tax rate of 35% for the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to the impact of the amendments to Pueblo Viejo SLA resulting in an overall effective tax rate of 25% for 2013 versus our previous guidance of 29%. For the third quarter we had positive provisional pricing of $8 million and 4 million at Peñasquito and Alumbrera respectively. For the fourth quarter provisional pricing at Peñasquito– will reflect 70,000 ounces of gold priced at $1,027 per ounce, 4.2 million ounces of silver priced at $21.68 per ounce, 31.4 million pounds of lead priced at $0.94 per pound and 38.2 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.85 per pound. While Alumbrera will reflect 20.7 million pounds of copper priced at 331 per pound. In spite of the lower realized metal prices the company continued to generate strong cash flows from operations with adjusted operating cash flow for the third quarter of $375 million or $0.46 per share. We invested $575 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid $122 million in dividends this quarter. Strong cash flows and well managed capital investments are part of Goldcorp’s established goal of financial discipline. With 1 billion in cash and an undrawn revolver facility of 2 billion plus strong credit ratings at BBB plus and BAA2 we continue to be very comfortable in our ability to fund our capital programs both at our operating mines and new projects under any foreseeable lower gold price scenario. Our strong balance sheet, flexible capital expenditure program and continued focus on cost containment through our Operating For Excellence allowed us to continue to positively impact on our financial results and add value to our shareholders. With that I will turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Quail – Goldmand Sachs: Hi, guys congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for the update. My question is on Peñasquito, I got two, one is good guide and obviously as per the mine year plan do you see that continuing for the next sort of few quarters and even sort of into 2015 or is it going to go higher? Can you give some guidance on that?
Charles Jeannes: Sure. We are moving in phase four in a better grade throughout the year and that’s why the production profile is ramping up and we continue to look for a really strong fourth quarter at Penasquito. In terms of looking at the five year plan, yes our pushback sequences are looking to be in better grade material for the next five years so we are looking for a strong continuation of production improvements at Penasquito.
Andrew Quail – Goldmand Sachs: And second question just on the Well Field obviously starting construction in Q4 this year, when do you guys see that being completed?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah we are projecting it to be completed fourth quarter of 2014.
Andrew Quail – Goldmand Sachs: Yeah, thanks.
Operator: Thank you.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: The following question is from David Haughton from BMO Capital Markets, please go ahead.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Hi yes, thank you Chuck and guys. You have got [inaudible] by the sounds of it. Just back to the Penasquito we had seen some time ago a detail on the grade profile and it had been anticipated to get into much better grade but we have to change really to the rate at which material has been moved because you have not been able to run at full capacity. We have been at some stage expecting to get out to the 0.7 grams level around 2015. Is that still the way that you are looking at things?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah, we are working on our new budget for next year and five year plan but more comfortable with the strong increase in grade and therefore production profile will happen.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, but that kind of grade that we were provided with sometime ago is still something that we should be thinking about that, that’s a realistic target for you?
Charles Jeannes: Yes.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: And it’s good to see the throughput getting up by round about 110,000 tons a day level. Now I presume that you have got access to additional water, there has been floods and rains et cetera in there on a seasonal impact. Is that pretty much what’s driving this or are you just finding better ways to work with what you have got?
George Burns: So we have been expanding the current Well Field that we have been running the plant on since startup and that’s enabled us to meet our roughly 110,000 ton a day guidance that we have given. The Northern Well Field once constructed will add on top of that water enable, and sustained capability of ramping up production further. So the rain obviously was a good thing but it really didn’t have a direct impact on the quarter or next quarter. It’s really expanding, existing infrastructure about 50 watering in existing Well Field that’s enabled us to run these sort of production numbers.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: So George would you feel comfortable with the 110 to 115 thousand tons a day through balance of the year and into 2014 or is that too high in your mind?
George Burns: No, that’s consistent with our belief.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, now slipping back if I may to Cerro Negro. The production numbers that were provided in the guidance and also in Russell’s talk was 130 to 180 thousand ounces for 2014, is that inclusive of pre-commercial material or would you consider that commercial material?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah that includes preproduction.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so if we would just take a half that number size as you guess would that be a reasonable way of thinking what you could get for commercial production?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah, at this stage, David I think that’s within any error of any estimate.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Alright, and also noticed slower spend at Cerro Negro you’ve said you’ve been slowing down some of your development, you’re pulling back on your exploration et cetera but we still got a target of the CapEx at 2.6 built for 2013 had that 2.6 been adjusted for those kinds of slippages if you like into 2014 out of ‘13?
George Burns: Yeah, I think the 2.6 number had the 745 in there and we will be slightly below that but in the neighborhood I’d say somewhere around the 720 is my expectation for the year and those cost are then obviously when we don’t spent this year will roll into next year.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so quite a big spend really for the fourth quarter?
George Burns: Yeah, and we are seeing that for the last couple of months we have seen spending jump from the roughly 40 to 50 range to those 70 to 80 range. So we are seeing the spend and consequently we are seeing the progress on the ground and you saw some of that in the quarter.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. I guess second about the pressure that you have had on the capital cost saving completely understandable given the circumstances. We haven’t really had an update on the operating cost guidance for some time, are you in a position where you can give us an indication where that might be heading at Cerro Negro?
George Burns: David, we are in the process. The ore body as you know is one that is extremely robust. The exchange rate is obviously a challenge or the exchange rate is a challenge with the disconnect with the inflation rate and so we are working that through. Our assumptions going in are on the operating cost are going to be similar to what you have seen on the capital six to one exchange rate and that 20% to 25% to 30% exchange rate. So we don’t have those numbers we are looking at opportunities and we will get those to you in really in the first quarter it’s just too early with the construction schedule moving we have had to go and essentially go back to a zero base budget and so a lot of work going on the ground.
Charles Jeannes: Yeah, David if I can just add to that we have talked about this before but it’s certainly our expectation and I think the expectation of a lot of commentators and those who spend time looking at Argentina that there will be continued devaluation potentially as soon as following the elections coming up and it’s just next week. So we look at that as a very significant moving part that hopefully we have more clarity on as we get into next year and get closer to production and that will be very important in terms of our expectations on operating cost.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right, I just haven’t quite got over Cerro Negro but if you could let me have another question on this one. Having looked at your stockpile build up you have got some quite a lot of material there already some good grade, how did those grades compare to your book model, have you had an opportunity to test what’s coming out compared to what you would have predicted?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah, David, good question. Obviously not a huge amount of material but what we have seen today has been positive and no indication that, that trend won’t continue. And we are stockpiling the material as you would expect and quite frankly my longer term concern is that the mill may accelerate throughput and we will have the ramp up at the mine which is a great problem to have but the mine is doing an outstanding job. We are seeing what we expected to see and it’s not exactly what we had in our budget as far as what we are moving but while we are moving versus the block model is slightly positive.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and last question might also be in your area too Russell is Alumbrera so you have had a win there from the permitting side of things. What does that mean now, where does it stand in your pipeline and how it’s compared to other projects that you have got, have you have a chance to think about it little bit?
Russell Ball: Yeah, David, maybe I will take that one, first I just want to say that we are very pleased to have been able to get through the RCA reinstatement process, lot of hard work, lot of people on our team down in Chile. Having said that we now find ourselves with a feasibility study that’s quite stale in terms of capital and operating cost estimates that we need to get back to the drawing board and update that feasibility study and the problem that we have with respect to a lack of power supply solution still remains and so we’ll be working on that and as we learn more and have the better sense as things going forward there we will let you know.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.
Charles Jeannes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our following question is from Tony Lesiak from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Tony Lesiak – Canaccord Genuity: Good afternoon. I was hoping you could speak to the optimized mine plan of Hollinger, timing, production levels cost?
Charles Jeannes: Sure. Well, timing wise we’re expecting probably in the quarter it will get started. Meanwhile we’re drilling to better understanding of ore body and to get set up for mining. It is more robust and it’s smaller production is going to be a bit less than half a million ounces total, the mine life looks to be about five years, about 10 million tonnes or little less than 1.5 gram per tonne and we’ll get a good return on investment on this one that will support, lower operating cost that we’re attacking with their old reprogram.
George Burns: Yeah, Tony if I can just add down, Hollinger is one of those that I think is a good example, what we all need to do in lower gold price environment. We’ve looked at this compared to the original feasibility plan and gone back in and made a smaller and much higher return and lower cost. So we’re not moving as many tonnes, we’re many not making as many ounces but we’re making better returns on our investment and that’s the kind of thing that we’re trying to do around the organization and it’s a good example of it.
Tony Lesiak – Canaccord Genuity: And how would that fit with the Porcupine camp in terms of incremental production lift?
Charles Jeannes: So bringing Hollinger on allows us to be less reliant on the low grade stock piles that enable us to keep that mill built. So it’s basically going to offset some of the low grade stockpile production with a bit better grade coming in at Hollinger and therefore helping our operating costs.
Tony Lesiak – Canaccord Genuity: So in terms of just looking at the Porcupine cost structure you’d expect further benefits to what you achieved this most recent quarter as Hollinger comes on board?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah, Hollinger’s going to be than the stockpile material we’ve been processing, so yes.
Tony Lesiak – Canaccord Genuity: Okay. And then just the final question for you George looking at Penasquito unit cost what’s your goal post optimization?
George Burns: That’s the tough one, you put a target of there that stretches everybody and I guess what I can tell you is we’re focused on benchmarking against the big mines across the Americas and we see significant opportunity in Penasquito to get those unit cost per tonne down and I can tell you we’ve got a lot of big opportunities teed up and our team focused on. So I don’t want to give you any numbers but I can tell you it’s significant improvement.
Tony Lesiak – Canaccord Genuity: Okay. thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. The following question is from Adam Graf from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Adam Graf – Cowen & Co.: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. Guys, I was hoping that you guys could talk a bit about the proposed tax royalty legislation in Mexico and how that would potentially impact your operations and effective tax rates?
Charles Jeannes: Thanks Adam. Certainly we’re not happy about the tax proposal that has been made in Mexico. It’s significantly higher than what had been discussed over the last years. So this issue has been on the table in our discussions with government. We think that it’s not well thought out frankly by the government in it would take Mexico from being one of our more competitive jurisdictions from a tax standpoint to being one of our highest tax jurisdictions and necessarily that will hurt foreign investment, or investment period in the mining industry and we got things got in front of us that are very significant like Comino Rojo and Deep Penasquito multi billions of dollars of potential investments in the future that will just have that much higher hurdle rate if this tax goes through as proposed. So certainly those are the kinds of the discussions we are having with government and we hope that they listen. I am not able to give you any specific numbers because there is a lot of moving parts but clearly the additional tax of 7.5% on EBITDA and you can figure that up directly from our financial statements would be an increase, pretty significant increase in the tax stake in Mexico but it’s not going to materially impact our existing assets. What it does, as I said changes that hurdle rate for new investments and it will likely drive our capital elsewhere, if we don’t get the returns we are looking for in Mexico we’ll put it somewhere else.
Adam Graf – Cowen & Co.: And just a quick follow up regarding that the current taxes you guys are paying at Penasquito are these still the 17% minimum tax or have you guys moved up to the 30% corporate tax rate and if you haven’t moved up yet what’s the estimated time horizon there?
Lindsay Hall: Adam it’s Lindsay yeah, that works with 30% .
Adam Graf – Cowen & Co.: Okay. Very good thank you guys.
Charles Jeannes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The following question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Good afternoon guys. My questions is regards to the 10% withholding tax that Argentina is proposing on dividends out of the country. Is that different from the resource tax?
Lindsay Hall: Anita it’s Lindsay, it’s different from resource correct, it’s correct.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Alright so we should be modeling 10% additional taxation on Cerro Negro starting when you start to go commercial?
Lindsay Hall: No because you know that when we pay dividend out of Cerro Negro you can imagine how we finance Cerro Negro is not debt equity. So for the first many years of Cerro Negro we are taking the cash out through repayment of loans so that won’t attract any tax.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then with respect to the capital cost escalation at Cerro Negro. What do you expect will be the sustaining capital life of mine at this stage given the escalation you’ve had on the capital cost side or preproduction capital cost?
Russell Ball: Yes Anita it’s Russ sustaining capital there is actually product of the budget exercise as you are well aware I think it’s in the range of $40 million to $50 million if memory serves but we are looking at with Mariana Norte not being developed it’s going to change. So 40 to 50 round numbers was my recollection but we can get back to you.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: 40 to 50 per annum.
Russell Ball: 40 million a year, total sustaining capital.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Alright, thank you .
Operator: Thank you. The following question is from Brian Yu from Citi. Please go ahead.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Great, thanks. Then my first question is on Penasquito and I had looked at the presentation that you guys had issued when I had done a tour few years back and it looks like your recovery rates are tracking better than the one that were expected. Recognize that there is natural relationship between grade and recovery but if you look at the grades you are running at now are recoveries running as expected or is it better than you thought?
Charles Jeannes: It’s fairly variable to be candid, overall the recoveries are in line with our expectations. But it’s the complex ore body and we get into certain ore blocks the recoveries are significantly below the averages you see in our results and time zone or above. So I guess I describe our complex ore body overall recoveries are doing what we expected.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay. and then second one is fact back to Adam’s question on Mexico tax. You say it does go through the Senate as proposed. Do you think that’s going to have an impact on the carrying value of the property on the books?
Lindsay Hall: No, Brian it’s Lindsay. We build that into our whatever we do it I think you are talking about impairment test and we – we are fine Brian fine.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instruction) The following question is [Harry Metier] from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. When you guys issued your bond deal earlier this year I think the initial intent is to keep some of the proceeds on the balance sheet to handle the 2014 convert that would necessary return to the bond market. I just want to get an update obviously the near term commodity outlook has changed a bit and higher cost at Cerro Negro. Can you just update us what on your thinking about next year convert and how you might address it?
Lindsay Hall: Harry, it’s Lindsay I mean obviously we have to – the payment is due in August ‘ 14 so we’ll make that decision but if gold prices stay where they are at today 1,300 or whatever they are settling on today. We do have capital flexibility but probably our intention is if you asked me today what I see doing we’d probably go into the market and finance that in 2014.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The following question is from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Hi. Good morning everybody.
Charles Jeannes: Good morning John.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Just following up on Hollinger did you say what the current calculated gold price?
Charles Jeannes: Little less than the 1,000 bucks.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay. so you don’t have to move the road and some houses?
Charles Jeannes: Yeah there is no infrastructure impacted by the pit design and it still accomplishes reclamation of the historic mining that was also a target of this mine plan.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay perfect. The strip ratio for that do you have that?
Charles Jeannes: It’s roughly four to one.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay excellent. Thank you very much.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to return the meeting to Chuck Jeannes.
Charles Jeannes: Okay. Thanks very much everyone. Just a final note on the gold price the U.S government shut down and weaker than expected labor statistics have further deferred expectations for an end to the fed’s quantitative easing program anytime soon I think. And so we saw the gold price respond positively to this development but regardless of the short term moves based on fed action or inaction we firmly believe that the long term factors supporting the strong gold price remain in place. But we can control the price of gold. So we will continue to focus on those things we can control, delivering on our production forecast, reducing our cost and being careful stewards of our shareholder’s capital. So thanks everyone for joining us today. Have a safe and healthy holiday season and we look forward to talking to you again in the New Year. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today’s conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc. 2013 Second Quarter Conference Call for Thursday, July 25, 2013. Please be advised this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you, Dave, and welcome everyone to the Goldcorp second quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Capital Management. For those of you participating on the webcast, we’ve included a number of slides to support this afternoon’s discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes.
Charles A. Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are coming to you from Mexico City, where we just concluded our quarterly board meetings. We were also pleased to visit the key stakeholders and government representatives during our time here. In our experience, this week only reinforces what we’ve long believed that Mexico is one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. We’re fortunate to have some of our most important operations here and we look forward to a continuation of these important relationships for many years to come. I’m also pleased to introduce to you the newest member of our executive team and someone many of you know well from his time as a peer company, Russell Ball, our new Executive Vice President of Capital Management. A big part of Goldcorp’s future is its growth projects and Russell’s primary focus is ensuring that these projects are not only delivered successfully, but also with an appropriate focus on financial discipline. With a forecast, $2.6 billion capital spend this year, Russell brings valuable skills and a lot of experience that have already begun to pay dividends. In addition to our financial results, we’ll also review some of the capital spending and expense reductions that we’ve implemented in response to recent volatility in metals prices. It’s important to point out that our underlying business remains very strong. We’re taking these actions to safeguard our financial strength and to sustain our success in any conceivable market environment. Our operations remained sound and our growth projects continue to progress. So the company remains well positioned for both short and long-term success, and this strong position has allowed us to maintain our dividend without change. So moving on to the results, gold production increased in the second quarter inline with our expectations driven by the continued production ramp up at both Peñasquito and Pueblo Viejo. Unfortunately, our second quarter production was weighted towards the end of the quarter and nearly half of the sales came in the month of June, which was, of course, when we saw the large drop in metal prices. This resulted in our actual realized prices coming in well below the quarterly average for both gold and silver, and this addition of approximately 14,000 gold ounces [explored] at Red Lake remained in inventory at quarter end. Together these factors significantly impacted our revenue and lead to a lower than expected earnings result. Grades in production at Peñasquito increased from the first quarter as planned. Costs were above expectations largely due to the impacts of our annual labor settlement. We remain comfortable with our guidance at Peñasquito as we expect grades to continue to increase over the second half. We also announced important updates on the Peñasquito water studies, including the confirmation of a new water source that once constructed will remove a key obstacle to resuming the sulphate plant ramp up to design capacity. Detailed engineering, surface access and permitting activities are underway towards the expected commencement of construction in the fourth quarter of this year. In response to the recent declines in metal prices and the resulting valuation decrease for exploration assets, we’ve taken a non-cash charge of $1.96 billion after-tax. This impairment was mainly driven by a reduction in the market value of the expiration potential of Peñasquito. Lindsay will provide further details on that and Peñasquito continues to be a world class asset that will be one of key drivers of cash flow for many years to come. At Pueblo Viejo, we announced in early May that an agreement-in-principle had been reached with the government of the Dominican Republic concerning amendments to the special lease agreement, and both sides continue to work their towards a definite agreement. Our approach to managing the business in various gold price environments remains consistent. We discussed with you back in April the actions that we would take in various gold price environments. Since that time, we’ve seen a significant reduction in metals prices and we therefore implemented reductions in G&A, exploration and capital spending. We’ve reduced our total 2013 capital expenditures by $200 million to $2.6 billion. I’m pleased to be able to reaffirm our 2013 guidance of between 2.55 million ounces and 2.8 million ounces of gold production with all-in sustaining cash cost between $1,000 and $1,100 per ounce. And we were above this number in the second quarter, which highlights an interesting point with respect to this new cost metric, namely the sustaining capital, which is now included, tends to be lumpy at the operations from quarter-to-quarter as mines make needed capital investments. With increased production and lower sustaining capital planned for the second half. We remain comfortable with our annual guidance for the all-in sustaining cost. We’ve also reduced our outlook for G&A and exploration spending for the year. The new G&A guidance is $164 million and exploration has been reduced to $200 million. Looking further ahead, the key elements of our five-year production profile remain in place. We continue to advance three high-quality gold projects that are positioned to deliver strong returns for our shareholders in a wide range of potential metals price environments. So in summary, our projects continue on track. We had a solid quarter operationally and we expect a better second half. So with that, I’m going to turn it right over to George for a review of operations.
George R. Burns: Thanks, Chuck. Gold production in the first quarter totaled 640,000 ounces with solid production across the mine portfolio that keeps us on track for 2013 guidance. Starting with Red Lake, production totaled 122,500 ounces at a total cash cost of $523 per ounce. Production decreased as expected compared to the first quarter as favorable mining sequence in the first quarter provided higher grades in tonnage in the High Grade Zone as compared to the second quarter. High Grade Zone de-stressing in the 46-47 level is progressing as planned and mining in this area is included in the mine plan for the fourth quarter with minimal ounces expected. Exploration drilling continued on the NXT zone and results today have been better than expected. The zone remains open vertically into the west, and several drills are targeting this zone, both from the 4199 exploration drift and from existing infrastructure at higher levels in the mine. The key to mining successfully at Red Lake has always been maintaining flexibility and the NXT demonstrates good potential to enhance operational flexibility. At Peñasquito, the second quarter gold production totaled 88,100 ounces and by-product cash costs of $920 per ounce. As expected, production increased from the first quarter, as we began mining in a higher grade portion of the pit, which increased our average grade from 0.31 gram per ton at 0.43 gram per ton. We expect the grade to continue to increase throughout the year to approximately 0.6 gram per ton in the fourth quarter. Mill throughput in the quarter averaged approximately 105,000 tons per day and due to peak water availability, June averaged almost 120,000 tons per day. We continue to expect production of between 360,000 ounces to 400,000 ounces for the year. We are aggressively targeting efficiency improvements and cost reductions at Peñasquito. On the mining side, we have made good progress in increasing efficiencies with respect to blasting, truck loading and several productivity. We expect these and other improvements to yield significant reductions in our mining costs over time. On the processing side, we are targeting further refinements to the primary crusher that are expected to resolve in greater productivity of the circuit. Overall, Peñasquito can operate much better and it will. Our operating for excellence initiatives are taking room and we look forward to seeing the benefits of these changes over time. Our exploration drilling on the deep [scar] and below the Peñasquito pits continues to be positive. Fixed drills have nearly completed the plant wide space, testing phase of the deep copper gold (inaudible) deposit, which remains open in all directions. We are pleased to announce identification of a new water source called the Northern Well Field that is expected to provide sufficient water to reach our permitted water capacity for Peñasquito. The Well Field is located approximately 60 kilometers from the mine, within the basin of our approved water rights. We are currently engaged in permitting activities and evaluating routing alternatives for the pipeline with an expected construction start in the fourth quarter. The capital cost is estimated to be approximately $150 million with completion expected late in 2014. We have also studied options to enhance tailings efficiency of Peñasquito with thickened tailings being a desired component of the options being evaluated. A follow-up study is now underway that will analyze the redesign of the current tailings facility to accommodate thickened tailings to reduce overall fresh water requirements of Peñasquito. The study is expected to be completed mid-2014. Pueblo Viejo continues its ramp up to full capacity. Gold production totaled 81,000 ounces at by-product cash cost of $507 per ounce. The increase in tonnes milled during the second quarter resulted from the ramp up of the autoclave facility and progress in implementing modifications required to meet design capacity. The new 215 megawatt power plant is expected to be commissioned on schedule in the third quarter. Now, I’d like to turn the call over Russell Ball for a review of the projects.
Russell Ball: Thanks, George, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. It’s truly a pleasure and honor to be speaking with you today as part of the Goldcorp team. I look forward to help me deliver the significant growth profile that we ahead of us, one which I believe to be the best in the gold business. It’s been a busy two months in my new role. I have been very impressed with the culture, the people and the level of energy and excitement within the company. I am making it a priority to meet with as many of the projects site and regional leaders as I can, to get their perspectives on the challenges and opportunities we face in addition to visiting the operations and projects to get a first hand understanding of the assets. I’m also spending time developing a framework to provide a more rigorous and disciplined capital allocation process whereby projects and mines will be required to compete for capital not just across the internal portfolio of opportunities, but also against what is available to M&A. As part of this effort, we are working on enhancing our stage grade process to enable a better understanding of risk adjusted returns, so we can allocate capital more effectively. Obviously, in light of the recent decline in the gold price and the inherent capital intensive nature of this business, the need for increased financial discipline is more important than ever. Turning to slide 16, I had the pleasure of visiting Cerro Negro in Argentina last week, and was impressed with the progress the team is making. Underground oil production from the Eureka mine commenced at the beginning of the quarter and initial ore development commenced at the Mariana Norte and Mariana Central mines in June. Ore is being stockpiled on the surface while mine development continues with ramp access, vertical raises, and horizontal stope development. At the end of June, engineering was approximately 93% complete and the overall EPCM stope was 60.6% complete with a current forecast of first gold in December 2013. As previously discussed, the delay in receiving the permit for the mine electrical transmission line has a potential to delay commissioning and initial production into 2014. Consistent with our focus on reducing capital expenditures, we have deferred certain non-critical expenditures into 2014 with some spending potentially being deferred into 2015, as we evaluate the plant ramp up and performance in 2014. We’re going to make the right business decisions as we evaluate the inherent trade between capital cost and schedule going forward. Slide 17 shows a recent picture of the new building in light of the infrastructure. We will be getting a sliding completed shortly and the building closed all to the element, which should improve productivity rates for the rest of (inaudible). Turning to ÉLÉONORE in Quebec, initial gold productions remains on track for late 2014. Although we are reassessing the schedule in light on the recent forest fires and strike at Quebec. In this regard I wanted to recognize the efforts of the team that remained on side to coordinate the fire fighting efforts and thank the authorities for their assistance in extinguishing the largest fire in Quebec’s history. At quarter end, the exploration ramp progressed beyond 3,350 metres. The production shaft reached a depth of 383 metres and is on track to reach 742 metres by year end. Exploration this quarter focus on infill drilling the upper mine area and exploration in the lower mine area. A total of 23,528 metres of diamond drilling was completed from working platforms in the exploration ramp and at the 650 metres level. Currently, four diamond drills are conducting infill and exploration drilling. Slide 19, includes the recent photos of the new building in light of the infrastructure. The team is building a world class in the new district, but I believe will be a cornerstone operation for Goldcorp for decades to come. At Cochenour the Red Lake district, construction continues on schedule and on budget. At quarter end, the haulage drift was approximately 76%complete and the shaft widening has progressed to depth of 716 metres. Two drills continue to drill from the haulage drift to test the potential of the underexplored area above and below the drift. Underground exploration diamond drilling of the Bruce Channel Deposit will commence once the haulage drift has closed enough to drill pump and drilling platforms are excavated. In addition to progressing the Cochenour project, the team is working closely with existing Red Lake operations team to integrate Cochenour into the larger Red Lake operations to ensure we maximize the valley from not only this asset, but the existing facilities in the district. And finally, Camino Rojo in Mexico, we continue to advance the project. Exploration activities focused on infill drilling in extraction of more than 15 tons of core samples from metallurgical studies of the sulphide portions of the West Extension and Represa zones. In addition, 20 tons of oxide and transitional core samples were extracted from the Represa zone for column and flotation testing. With that I’d like to turn over to Lindsay for his financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks, Russel. As you just heard from George and Russell, production was up and significant progress was made at our project this quarter. Before I get into the financial details from a balance sheet management perspective, we are tracking to our financial plan for the year as the loss revenue is due to pricing this quarter as the last step by the delay in our capital spending. Right now we plan to be at the start of the year, so financially we have weathered the decline in metals prices extremely well. As for the quarter, our inability to capture the higher gold and silver prices at the beginning of the quarter was a disappointment. For the quarter, almost half of our gold and silver was sold in June, which coincided with the steep decline in prices and resulted in a significant difference between our realized prices and the average stock prices for the quarter. We estimate revenues and after sales in pricing amounted to approximately $0.06 per share. Also, affecting our earnings with inventory on hand at Red Lake and PV at the end of the second quarter, which we estimate amounted to some $0.02 per share. Lastly, we had a negative provisional pricing adjustments in the amount $0.02 per share Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera. So when you add up the average sales price realized, the inventory on hand and the negative provisional pricing impact that accounted for some $0.10 per share in earnings this quarter. The most significant non-cash item affecting our earnings was a $1.96 billion or $2.41 per share non-cash impairment expense, a $1.83 billion related principally to the decline in the market value in-situ exploration potential at the Peñasquito mine and $131 million related to our investment at Cerro Negro, excuse me, Cerro Blanco. The combination of the decline and commodity prices and its impact on our share price relative to the book value, were indicators of potential impairments under our accounting standards. As required under those standards, the company must have test for impairment and all our mining properties were indicators of present and complete the assessment as of point in time. For Peñasquito, basically half of financial statement carrying value was represented by the value of the mine and its associated reserves and resources plus goodwill, while the other half was in the value of an exploration potential, some would call it in-situ value. So the value of the mine, we updated the short-term metal pricing assumption, the forecast and capital required to develop Northern Well Field and the proposed mix in mining duty. The other part of the test was for the value of the exploration potential using a market approach, which examines market comparable information and characteristics. Based on the assessment performed as at June, 30 2013, the company concluded that the market value for in-situ ounce of exploration potential of Peñasquito declined during the second quarter by approximately 25% to 35% resulting in a reduction in the value of that exploration potential and representing a significant portion of the Peñasquito impairment charge noted above. IFRS impairment charges must first be allocated to any goodwill and then on a pro rata basis to the relative carrying amounts of the mining properties and exploration potential. Based on these standards, the pre-tax charge was first applied against $283 million of goodwill, then on a pro rata basis approximately $1.1 billion to the exploration potential, and approximately $1 billion to the mine. The Peñasquito impairment charge also resulted in a reversal of deferred tax liability of $600 million. Having dealt with the revenue shortfall and the impairment charges, which are the most significant items this quarter, I will just touch on a couple of other highlights. By-product cash costs were higher at $646 per ounces in Q3 2013 compared to $565 per ounce in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower by-product revenues, mainly resulting from lower metal prices. On a co-product basis, cash costs were consistent $713 per ounce in Q2 2013 compared to $710 in the prior quarter, as the impact of the higher production cost was offset by more ounces produced in the second quarter. Net loss for the second quarter amounted to $1.93 billion or $2.38 per share, compared to net earnings of $309 million or $0.38 per share in the prior quarter. Adjusted earnings for the quarter amounted to $117 million or $0.14 per share, compared to $253 million or $0.31 per share in the prior quarter. To calculate adjusted earnings, we adjusted our reported net loss $1.3 billion by adding back the impairment chargers of $1.96 billion net of tax and deducting the non-cash derivative gains of $16 million primarily associated with our convertible debt. We then removed the effect of the non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation of deferred income tax asset and liabilities of $74 million from the book tax provision and foreign exchange losses on capital projects of $22 million. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings disclosed on page 43 of our MD&A. Consistent with pervious quarters, we did not make any adjustment for non-cash share-based compensation expense, which amounted to $22 million or $0.03 per share. The income tax provision included in our calculated adjusted earnings for the second quarter has an applied tax rate of 16%. To calculate the more meaningful effect of tax rate, one needs to adjust the book tax recovery of $503 million over the following items. We have to add back the foreign exchange losses on the deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $74 million. The income tax expense related to Alumbrera and PV of $15 million, and effective tax recovery on impairment charges of approximately $600 million. From the loss before tax following decimals – it means to remove the impacts of the impairment charge of 2.6. $30 million of net mark-to-market gains from derivatives and $22 million of stock-based compensation [for us to] permanent differences and these items will never be taxable, resulting in an effective tax rate of 29% for the quarter. This rate is comparable to our full-year guidance, which we continue to expect as our full-year effective tax rate. For the third quarter, provisional pricing Peñasquito reflects 350,500 ounces of gold priced at $1,192 per ounce. 2.4 million ounces of sliver priced at 18.86 per ounce, 18.1 million pounds of gold priced at $0.93 per pound, and 31.8 million pounds of gold priced at $0.83 per pound. While as Alumbrera will reflect 25.5 million pounds of copper priced at $3.06 per pound. Although our statement of earnings reflects a loss for the quarter due to various impacts of mineral, lower metal pricers and the impairment charges. The company continues to generate strong cash flows from operations. Adjusted operating cash flows for the second quarter were $388 million or $0.48 per share. We invested $629 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid a $121 million in dividend this quarter. Strong cash flows and well managed capital investments are part of the Goldcorp’s established goal of financial discipline. With over $3.4 billion of liquidity and strong credit ratings, we are very comfortable that we can fund our capital programs and continue to return capital to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator:  Thank you, Mr. Hall. Questions will now be taken from the telephone lines. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Alec Kodatsky with CIBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Alec Kodatsky – CIBC World Markets: Great, thanks for taking the call. I just had a couple of questions on the operating side. First, with respect to Peñasquito highlighting that it operated above the 120,000 tonnes per day last month. Is that really a function of increased from water availability or is there some connection to some of the water reduction efforts as well?
Charles A. Jeannes:  Actually, a combination of the two. As planned we implemented additional wells in our existing field and so there is an increased supply of water. Additionally, we are looking at conservation within the operation earning slightly higher density in the floatation circuit and improve operating constrains out of the tailings pond themselves and ailing improved recovery. So it’s a combination of those. The one thing I would highlight the higher water availability that we saw in June was a result of a number of wells coming on stream, however, once and so our expectation, we’ll continue to see the decay in flow rates out of each of the individual wells and we’re still comfortable with our 105,000 ton a day expectation for the remainder of the year.
Alec Kodatsky – CIBC World Markets: Okay. And just wondering, maybe probably another question for you George, just if you could give a bit of color around the silver recovery issues at PV and some of the stuffs being taken there?
George R. Burns:
 :
Alec Kodatsky – CIBC World Markets: Okay. So it’s an equipment shift in, to view it’s still view the chemistry of the process is effective?
George R. Burns: Yeah. There’s three things that impacts silver recoveries, one is limestone additional or PH, two is the mineralogy of the silver in the third temperature and the temperatures are only issue and again, we’ve got a design retrofit that will be tested in the third quarter and optimistically we’re going to get it resolved.
Alec Kodatsky – CIBC World Markets: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Walker with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Thank very much, operator. First question is for Lindsay. Lindsay, I noticed that you’ve got again dividends from associates in the quarter from Alumbrera. What is your expectations or has there could be any indication on when you can expect dividends coming from Pueblo Viejo.
Lindsay Hall: No, we haven’t had a discussion with [Barrick] on Pueblo Viejo. I think Steven talked on behalf of (inaudible) and we’ll get the MOU signed first. and then we’ll decide what we’ll do with cash and everything, but you’d have to talk to [Barrick] to get more clarification on that.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you for that. and just on the Alumbrera amounts that are reported, is that cash that’s actually repatriated back to head office or is that, will that be the dividend that would be sitting in country, in Argentina?
Lindsay Hall: No, I thought we’re getting it out of the country, if your question to Steven, we’re actually slowing dividends out of the country from Alumbrera.
Charles A. Jeannes: Okay. is there a reasonable exchange rate, is that at the normal exchange rate that we would see posted, I guess on the North American markets. That’s something to be checked, I think that the official exchange rate, Steven.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay great thank you. George maybe just a follow-up question on the NXT zone of Red Lake, when do you expect to be developing Éléonore, I know you’ve got the development in place to do the detailed drilling, but can you give us a sense of when you could be developing Éléonore and when do you could be reporting presumably reserves at some point?
George R. Burns: So we’ll be touching the next ore body in the second half of this year. and in terms of production expectations, we expect to have some reserves at the end of the year, and some production in our 2014 production plan.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks for that, much for that and just maybe a question for Russell. Russell, in the prior conference call and Gary Goldberg made a comment that he thought for new mine the 12% hurdle rate would be an appropriate level. I’m just curious what you think an appropriate hurdle rate for precious metals, a gold mining company should be and given the jurisdictions in North and South America?
Russell Ball:  The interesting question is the mining. I think obviously, you do want to depend on the risking and the jurisdiction by jurisdiction. I would think that there are a number of factors whether it’s a single company versus a portfolio where you can diversify some of that risk. My personal belief is that 12 is a little high for the gold business, but I’ll ask Lindsay to chip in to give perspective, he got the best trends.
Lindsay Hall:  Usually, what we do feel is when we start looking at assets competition for capitals usually is about a 15% unlevered return and then start looking at the risks around that 15%. But we started, they deferred screening our opportunities to invest the capital.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much for that and congratulations on vending machine.
Russell Ball:  Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from John Bridges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Good morning, everybody.
Charles A. Jeannes:  Hi, John.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: My head is still spinning for your presentation, a lot of numbers there. I’m just thinking with respect to IFRS, is this a new age of upgrades and downgrades in the valuation of assets. Can we expect to see IFRS affecting a lot of other Canadian companies as we come through?
Lindsay Hall: Well, John, it’s Lindsay. It’s maybe new to – followed by you and me under IFRS that you can in turn asset write it down, but in the future for the fact that circumstances changing those indicators of testing and in fact, the indicator is saying if the value of the asset goes up, you can actually write it up, which is kind of new under IFRS plus.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Right. So that’s making you a little bit more amenable to tailoring the balance sheet to current valuation?
Lindsay Hall: I don’t think so, John. Not it’s like more than, I don’t think so. That’s not the case at all, it’s just applying the standard and I guess what I’d say there hasn’t been a lot of companies asking that have actually written up assets currently, but if in fact, you had sustained really quite high gold prices and you saw that into the future, that would start getting companies under IFRS having to look at the value of our assets, they’ve been impaired before.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Right, interesting. How you’re thinking about contingencies in this current environment with uncertain gold prices? You made some cuts, but would you guys further as the gold prices back or do you think you’ve done enough?
Charles A. Jeannes: And John, this is Chuck. If you think back to that slide, we put up this quarter and I put it up last quarter as well, I kind of talked about the range of options that we would look at various price scenarios. And what we’ve announced today is simply that we follow that plan and because we’re down below $1,400 gold price environment we’ve looked at cuts of SG&A, and exploration and some deferral of non-critical capital spending. And I just want to highlight again, that doesn’t impact our near-term production. And so what we would do in a lower price environment has also indicated on that slide. We get down into the $1,200 and below price environment for a period. We have to start looking at whether some of the high cost operations should be sustained at that level and as I said last quarter, the high cost operations are well aware of that and I guarantee you they are working very hard to reinvent themselves so that they can look at different configuration and be free cash flow positive at $1,200. So that's what we would do. We would look at it, but I suspect at the same time, George and his teams are going to be looking very hard at how to make those sites profitable in a lower price environment.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: But that result as you might expect might be some margin allowances that come out of the plan with a focus more on the higher quality ounces of those assets.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: All right. I’d like to echo Steve’s comments, welcoming Russell and pleased to you find a new best gold company.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, John. I appreciative it.
John Bridges – JPMorgan:  Yes. Bye.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tony Lesiak with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Question on costs, looking at by-product cash cost guidance for 2013 was unchanged and that’s despite the fact that you used some materially lower price assumptions for let say silver, copper, and if you look at the sensitivity table that you provided in the presentation and I mean you’d think that your cost structure should up about a $80 a ounce. Where is the offset going to be coming from?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, maybe I can just really quick, Tony, and to say that you recall we did give you a range, right? So we had some room within the range that we guided at the beginning of the year. And then secondly, based on our current price environment, we’re comfortable that we’re going to meet that guidance that we provided. Certainly, if we see a material move down in those by-product metal prices between now and the end of the year that could change things.
Unidentified Company Representative:  Yeah, I’ll just add. We’ve got a range in both our production and our cash costs and our production is coming in solid and we are feeling some pressure from lower silver prices, but we’re still within the guidance.
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Okay. So there’s no specific adds where you might have some more flexibility to improve grades or lower costs in the near-term.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, as planned, we’ve got higher grades at Peñasquito production increases and Peñasquito and Alumbrera, but those were as planned.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah just to make clear, we’re not making any short-term changes to try to meet that numbers just as the mine plants continue as said at the beginning of the year?
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Okay. And maybe, just on Peñasquito, can you talk to your comfort level of let’s say analysts utilizing long-term 130,000 ton a day throughput rate, starting from 2015 on?
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure. With the announcements of our water availability in our project, our confidence of having adequate water for 130,000 tonnes a day is very good. And if you look at our announcement today, we did a 120,000 ton in June. So, that, I think can give everybody confidence that the ramp up is continuing and will continue. Now averaging 130,000 ton a day consistently, we’ve got further pushing of that plants that needs to occur and until it happens, we can expect this further debottlenecking to occur. The only bottleneck we currently have for the production we’ve pushed thus far on the mine has been the primary crusher. And we’ve made some good progress in debottlenecking that reducing time or the pressure is not there, reducing the amount of plugging and bridging that happens within the pressure, and that’s happened by improved blasting. So, I’m comfortable we are going to achieve designed throughput at Peñasquito and the win will depend on getting the water available and pushing the circuit.
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Okay, thanks, Russ. And then finally, just on the timing of your results and met test from Camino?
Russell Ball: It’s Russ. Yeah, we are very early on the met program goes out through the third quarter of next year, so I would like to lock in some before the end of next year. We are busy recruiting for a study there, I think it’s really drive Camino Rojo. We feel it’s a significant opportunity in a very perspective bill. We are continuing to fund the project and we are quietly optimistic that this will become an ex-Goldcorp mine in Mexico, but it is very early to look for results and I’ll update towards the end of next year.
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Okay. But you won’t be giving us an update on drilling or expiration sitting there?
Charles A. Jeannes: Yeah, Tony, this is Chuck. We will give you the normal update on drilling at year end and an updated resource for the project. And it’s our resource that we hand over them to the projects group and in combination with all the network and the other things that are going on, we intend to start a free feasibility study next year. And I’ll just say that we’re going on a lot of different funds here. We are continuing to drill in full speed, doing the metallurgical testing as a person when you are testing. We are working on lot of supplies which, of course, is a key issue in that part of Mexico. We are working on land acquisition in the Eagle agreements, so there is a lot of things happening, and this will hopefully accommodate in the kick off of met study sometime next year.
Tony Lesiak – Macquarie Capital Markets.: Great. Thanks so much.
Charles A. Jeannes: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Haughton with BMO. Please go ahead.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Yes, hi, and thank you, everybody for the update. Just following on from Tony’s question about the ramp up to 130,000 tonnes there, George, I heard what you were saying, is that reasonable to expect that you could be at that point of run rate, maybe 2016 sort of time, if you do get the pipeline in, by middle of next year?
George R. Burns: That’s not an unreasonable expectation. I mean, we are and as I said we hit the 120,000 tonnes in June. So my comfort level has improved relative to a quarter ago, and we are focused on other things we can do with the primary crusher to be able to sustain the 130,000. So I would expect we can beat that date, but I just caution everybody that let us hit the water, let us continue to ramp up, and I’m optimistic we’ll be there.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. And with that in mind and I know that you are looking at the additional studies to see what you can do for potentially thickening or dissecting portion of the tails, is that just as a safety backup or do you see that is required for longer-term sustainability at that higher rate?
George R. Burns: So I mean we are only looking at thickening, now we eliminated through test work, the idea of filter tailings. So we are focused entirely now from a reduction of water consumption to the thickener option. And really it fits in with an overall strategy costs, what’s our lowest cost option, and then knowing that we’ve got the potential to increase our production logistic with Camino Rojo and water is going to be a key asset. So any reduced water requirements of Peñasquito enables us to have additional water for the Camino Rojo project. So the second, it looks to make really good sense economically, it makes sense from a – protecting the water resource and our expansion plans in the district.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: So is this Northern Well Field also or likely source for Camino?
George R. Burns: Well, we’re going 60 kilometers to the north to tie into this Northern Well Field. Camino Rojo has roughly the same distance to the south.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
George R. Burns: So we can tie infrastructure and that’s what the feasibility study indicates the best option, but obviously we’re looking for water closer to Camino Rojo, it’s the best option.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. Now, just switching to another part of America, thinking about Cerro Negro, what you’re saying about a little bit slower on the connection of the power and possibly looking at a little bit of slippage on the deliver day maybe. What should we be thinking about for the capital spend remaining for this year and into next year, if we’re thinking about sliding money around a bit?
George R. Burns: Maybe, let me just say first David, and I’ll pass it to Russell then. I guess I remind you that nothing has changed from the last quarter. We told you then that the late delivery of that pyramid was putting our first goal in late 2013 at risk, although that’s still what we’re shooting for. And then secondly, to the extent that we do defer some capital from 2013 into 2014, which is what we announced today, obviously the amount to be spent in 2014 will go up from what we would have planned previously. And maybe, Russell, turn it over to you for the details.
Russell Ball: Yeah, David, as far as spend, we spent just under $300 million for the first six months, and we expect to spend about 750 for the year or so an additional 450 in the second half.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: And next year what sort of number you are looking at there around 350, 400ish kind of number?
Lindsay Hall: Let me get back to you, David. We’re actually going through an evaluation as Chuck mentioned on deferring non-critical, and we’re looking at putting some of the fine grinding capital potential into 2013, so we’re going through the analysis right now. We'll be able to give you at least a better indication on the third quarter call and then once finalize the budget in early December.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. Question now to Éléonore, I guess on a similar time here, you’ve got development of the Upper mine underway and that’s going to get you to 3.5 tonnes a day ultimately doubling with Lower mine 2017 is your kind of time. With the conservation of capital and sliding things through time, can you see a scenario where that Lower mine could be pushed out in time if needed? 
Charles A. Jeannes: Well, just to be clear that is not the scenario of today. All we’ve done right now is push some non-critical path surface infrastructure into 2015 given that we’re in a low revenue environment and this conserving capital. We have not done anything to impact the long-term plan. And frankly, we don’t intend to in this environment, we’re quite comfortable with our liquidity and with the plan there at Éléonore. Again, if things changed, if the gold price dropped and stayed there for a while, those would be the kinds of things you would have to think about deferring the development as a Lower mine would be one of things on the list.
Lindsay Hall: And David to give you an indication of capital, we’re about $284 million for the first six months and we expect to be around $650 million for the full year.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Gotcha, all right. Thank you very much for that.
George R. Burns:  Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Greg Barnes with TD Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes – TD Newcrest Securities: Thank you, operator. Question back to Peñasquito, in the financial – one of the financial statements you talk about running the impairment test on the assets of various costs per tonne and you used a 50 per tonne of gold mills. It seemed relatively high versus the carbon rate, and I would expect them to come down if you are increasing the throughput to 130,000 tonnes. Is the 850,000 just a conservative number or is that your expectation going forward?
George R. Burns: Yes, George, that is a conservative number. Our current costs are better than that and our expectation through our continuous improvement processes is to get better.
Greg Barnes – TD Newcrest Securities: Okay. So it’s more like 750 would be an appropriate number or 700 tonne?
George R. Burns: Yeah, Greg, also and again, this is George, for the impairment testing that the 750 up would give or take, we added some – we believe that down the line that in fact, we will be adding some milling costs for maybe in order to get deeper in the ore body for perhaps some copper. So that is the cost and because remember when we look at impairment test we are looking at the whole weight of the mine and when we put in the average cost and say those are the parameters we use for valuing the net present value of the mine life, and we are looking over a long period of time for the impairment test. So it might start out, it will start out at a much lower rate in 853 and then build up as we start to know some of those additional impact. Copper is the bottom around the ore body, so okay, that we use for impairment analysis. But it’s certainly much higher than current run rate we anticipate for the next period of time.
Unidentified Company Representative: Our current costs are in that 725, 775 per tonne range, and again, we’re looking at opportunities to bring that number down.
Greg Barnes – TD Newcrest Securities: Right, okay, good. Secondly, on PV, I’m just wondering on the status of the autoclave, I believe one of them was going to come up in the second half of 2013. I’m just wondering where we are in the run rates on each of the autoclaves at this point?
George R. Burns: So yeah, we’ve got three or the four autoclave retrofits completed before nearly complete, and all those retrofit designs are operating as planned. We have had issues with delivery of the modified valves which are the big valves in the autoclave circuit, and that’s caused some issues on the ramp up in the second quarter. But essentially, we’re on track with the retrofits and again, comfortable with the guidance we’ve put out for Pueblo Viejo and expecting to get the full production in the second half for design.
Greg Barnes – TD Newcrest Securities: Okay, good. Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Farooq Hamed with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Farooq Hamed – Barclays Capital Canada, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is related to Peñasquito. So in your MD&A, when you talk about the impairment charge, you took, you said that is the result of the institute exploration ounces, but you also mentioned that’s in combination with changes of the life of mine plant. So can you give us some details on what you meant there by changes to the life of mine plant?
Lindsay Hall: Yeah, all we did Farooq, it’s Lindsay, all we did for changes in the life of mine plant is that as we announced today, we put in the northern water. So we found the water, so there is capital George talk about, but attaching that, and there is a proposed mining tax in Mexico that we took a position on that and took that into the life of mine plant, although the two primary changes to what I call the operating mine.
Farooq Hamed – Barclays Capital Canada, Inc.: Okay, so there wasn’t any, let’s call them uneconomic ounces that were removed from the current mine plant.
George R. Burns: None of that, but we also get use a short-term lower short-term price stack on that life of mine plan.
Farooq Hamed – Barclays Capital Canada, Inc.: Okay and then maybe just switching gears a little bit, talking about the Cochenour solution there, so that’s expected the study for the Cochenour solution expected to be done by mid-2014, given that if it’s viable it can reduce your water requirements by nearly 40% power potentially up to 40%, if it’s viable how quickly could you implement that solution after the study is done.
George R. Burns: So the current tailing is down that we’re depositing in, that was part of the initial construction. It’s got 4.5 years of life left and it employs the use of cyclones for separating sands and fines, and Cochenour won’t work in that configuration, so the studies are to look at Cochenour in the new tailings down that would be implemented in four to five years. And again we are confident, we know that the cost of the Cochenour, we’re confident about the water that we’ll save and confident that it’s going to be an important part of the next phase of the tailings designed at Peñasquito, but it’s implementation is four, five years out.
Farooq Hamed – Barclays Capital Canada, Inc.: Okay that’s helpful thank you. And then maybe one last question, just about related to your slide on managing the volatile gold prices, so you know you have a point there that the gold prices about 1200 you would look at reconfiguring and shutting down the higher cost mines, one question there would be how long would the gold price have to be sustained under that level before you started making those decisions.
Charles A. Jeannes: Yeah there is no defined timeframe, it really depends on a wide variety of factors that we would take into consideration to give us the best estimate of the future price rate. It's not just how long it stays there. It’s what the macroeconomic environment is in the world that gives us our best ability to estimate what the future might be. So I can’t say that it's a quarter or two quarters and it also depends largely on the mine itself. If they're able to make adjustments so that they are not bleeding free cash, then we certainly have more time to be able to work through that process.
Unidentified Company Representative: I might just add, from particularly open pits and lower metal prices, we run pit designs at that lower metal price and come up with modified ultimate pit and modified mine sequence. So at any one of the operations, if we’re pressured on the lower metal price we’re going to be working our opportunities to optimize mine plants and that will improve the cash flow. So those are levers we would pull in. The underground’s are similar that you – there are lot of great stokes that require development and when you look at the all in cost of mining those ounces, some of them will drop off at lower prices and obviously because they are lower grade they're going to have small impact on our production profile, but will help in operation the more cash flow positive and lower metal price. So there is number of levers that we can pull and again our teams are focused on looking at those alternatives as we speak.
Farooq Hamed – Barclays Capital Canada, Inc.: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Chidley with HSBC. Your line is now open sir. Please go ahead.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Thanks. Hi, everybody.
Unidentified Company Representative:  Hi, Patrick.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Just a couple of legal questions and maybe Chuck can address these. First, down in Santa Cruz, maybe you can just stretch out a bit more detail about this proposed or actually now enacted 1% tax and whether or not you feel this is possibility being grandfathered on the previous system or if everybody has to pay this and if not what are the ways in which you think you can fight this?
Unidentified Company Representative:  Well, Patrick, I certainly, we believe and I think I can fairly speak for the other operators and the developers in Santa Cruz that this is not a tax that’s supportable under the law of Argentina and so we will be approaching or considering our options in terms of a legal challenge to that tax. Now, it has been enacted, but in a very broad based form and there is a lot of work that needs to be done to actually implement it, and during now and then, this one will be considering those legal options.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: I should say that there is a connection between the fact that we’ve shutdown exploration at Cerro Negro in the tax. I mean, there are several factors involved and certainly we are looking to defer in our necessary spending throughout the organization and we have many, many years, 9 years of solid reserve life already laid down in front of us at Cerro Negro. But if we’re going to be taxed on the value of our reserves, it doesn’t really make a lot of sense to add years to that reserve profile going forward.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Right, right. And as I understand, they’re proposing to charge 1% of the revenue potential, institute value of your reserves each year, is that right?
Lindsay Hall: That’s the reported system, yes.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Exactly, okay. And then just a small one here, that wasn’t a legal challenge or an issue at one of the Ejido’s at Peñasquito. I think last quarter, I just wanted to know more – outcome of that was come to an agreement and solved the problem or if it’s still an issue?
Charles A. Jeannes: It’s still outstanding. I can say that we’ve got a lot of folks working on it from a lot of different directions, and I feel confident that we’ll get to a situation where we can negotiate a fair settlement with the Ejido and that’s what we’re working towards, but there is legal matters pending and a lot of work going on, on that right now.
Patrick Chidley – HSBC Securities: Okay. Thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brian Yu with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question is on Peñasquito, I’m not sure if you guys have shared what the July milling rate is looking like? And then also with the expected decay and well output for the remainder of the year if you guys had an expectation what that’s going to look like and when it will stabilize?
Charles A. Jeannes: I can just give you a broad description and we’ve got additional wells planned, and our expectation for the second half is to have adequate water to average 105,000 tonnes a day. So there is going to be a movement from month-to-month depending on when wells come on stream and that decrease in water coming out of existing Well Field. And in terms of trying to predict month-by-month throughput, I’m not going to do that. I’ll just tell you, I’m confident we’re getting an average around 105,000 tonnes a day in the second half and expect it will be a bit lumpy month-to-month and its all about the water that’s available and wells that come on stream and this decay in flow rates.
Unidentified Company Representative: And just to clarify, Brian, that is well within our guidance for gold production that we’ve given you for the year. So we’re comfortable in reaffirming that guidance.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay. And how is July been working?
Charles A. Jeannes: July is on track with that.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay. And then this is a (inaudible) question, but with that 20% write-down in the Peñasquito carrying by, should we be modeling a proportionate drop in the DD&A going forward?
Charles A. Jeannes:  There will be a drop in the DD&A going forward, but not 20% drop. I am actually, I have to get back to you Brian, but as you know most of the impairment went against exploration potential. This doesn’t affect appreciation. On an allocation basis, we have to allocate some to the plant. But we don’t have an immediate impact this year, but in the future it might, it will.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay, guys. And just switching gears a little bit, on Cerro Negro, I heard Russell said, that you sent deferrals as for some fine grinding. Could you elaborate on other pieces of it that are being deferred, and if that has any impact on expected ramp of the production or cost?
Charles A. Jeannes: Yeah Brian, just to go back, it was the fine crushing circuit as we know areas 200. We have the equipment, but we are looking at running without that just to see the ramp up and conserving capital and then we’ll install it if and when we need it. As far as the other reductions, things like admin, warehouse, a maintenance shop somewhere in the order of $30 million to $50 million, we are still working through that analysis with the team, but it’s what I consider non-discretionary, and converting initial construction facilities into more permanent facilities and saving capital that way too.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Got it, the last one I got is with the sales and how we are half, nearly half it’s all in the month of June, is that normal or is there something else that occurred in the quarter.
Charles A. Jeannes: No, that’s actually pretty normal as you might expect, we kind of clean-up the circuits beyond each quarter, and then get a slow start to the year, and as the growth company and with our production growing through the year, and it also grows the quarter, so that tends to put most of the production later in the quarter, and just to anticipate a question, we do not do any kind of speculating or holding back inter-quarter hedging or anything like that, we sell the gold as it comes out.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse Please go ahead.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Hi good morning guys. My question is with regard to the NPI that’s being implemented at PV, how do you anticipate treating that once it comes into effect, will it come into all in sustaining cost number or...
Charles A. Jeannes: You are very hard to hear Anita.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: I’m sorry about that. So on the PV NPI once that comes into effect, and you finalize that, will that be, how do you intend on treating that, would that come into the all in costs or excluded from that.
Charles A. Jeannes: I think I won’t, I will say my opinion but my good friend of mine, will actually determine that part, I don’t think it will be an all in sustaining costs. The net profits, interest taxes kind of the form of royalty to me, but you better average.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Yeah, that’s why it’s up debate right, so I was a bit curious.
Charles A. Jeannes: That’s all right, I can debate with tomorrow.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Okay, you could follow-on other side of the fence to get to (inaudible). And then just in terms of Cerro Negro, would it be safe to assume that you might be more inclined to take write-down if you have been required to, given the new taxation regime in Santa Cruz?
Unidentified Company Representative: We’ll actually, Anita, when we, as you know we got to look at all our properties and we actually even though obviously as you’ve heard from Chuck, we were disputing that tax lead for account through that tax in, and even then, we had lost the head room at Cerro Negro. The Cerro Negro impairment really revolves around our assumption that there will be a devaluation in the peso, but that ore body is so large and high graded even when we threw the tax in for modelling assumption and it was just for modelling assumptions, still had headroom, lots of headroom.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: And two last questions, the first question was with regard to those production costs and leverages you provided, production costs are essentially just the operating cost right before the sustaining costs in your, so when you say something has to increase by 56%, we’re talking about the operating costs having to increase by 56%?
Unidentified Company Representative: Maybe, I’m confused, Anita, just to say your question a bit, Anita, whether you are you talking about the impairment or just the actual operating costs?
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: The impairments, the disclosure that provided, I think it’s on page five of the MD&A.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: And there is, like as an example, Red Lake staying 52% increase.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, yeah. That was – sorry, I’ll shut up for a second and let you ask your question.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Sorry, and so then when you’re saying the production costs, you’re talking about the production costs there is not the all-in sustaining costs?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, you are absolutely, correct, Anita. It’s just – we’re trying to give a hand on margin. How that…
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Yeah, and the last question also, because Tony, sort of said that something about the, sorry, guidance now as sort of reflecting higher cost assumptions. I guess, it was my understanding these are two separate issues that’s impairment charge doesn’t necessarily mean that you are using a lower gold price assumption for your byproduct credit guidance for this year, is that the case or?
Charles A. Jeannes: Well, yeah, I mean we are telling you that we believe our byproduct costs and our all end sustaining costs will meet the guidance that provided you at the beginning of the year. And obviously, there is risk in that if the byproduct metal prices go down very far. But where we are today, we’re still comfortable with that guidance. If the byproduct prices dropped meaningfully below where we are today, that would be a risk.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: All right. Thank you very much.
Charles A. Jeannes: Thanks, Soni.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Good morning, guys. I guess my question is maybe for Lindsay, could you specifically tell us what is the assumed Mexican resource tax that you’ve now baked in?
Lindsay Hall: Just a 5% profit tax on EBITDA, I’m sorry.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank: 5% EBITDA tax?
Lindsay Hall: Yeah.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Got it. And…
Charles A. Jeannes: Sorry I just want to interrupt. That hasn’t been determined for impairment testing. This is a number that was included in a law that was passed in one house of the Congress whether that exactly is what gets passed or when it gets passed we don’t know, but for impairment testing being conservative that’s what they put in. I wouldn’t want you to assume from that. We believe that 5% EBITDA tax is necessarily eminent.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Got it. And Lindsay, maybe if I could just prove a little more deeply on this write-down, can you just clarify, what was specifically the catalyst event? I know that you talk about lower commodity prices, but was it just playing in simply that, because typically these write-downs have been handled at the fourth quarter under IFRS as we’ve seen. So I just wanted to understand if there was anything more to it, if it was really the combination of the tax issue in Mexico and some other things? And then secondly, would there be anything that could lead to potential write-downs like this and other mines based on what the stress testing that you’ve already done or we’ve done with these kind of write-downs?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, first question is that we had the indicators we saw in the quarter was the commodity price decline plus we saw that the market cap of the company had dropped below our book value. So that gave us positive to the indicators that we had to test for impairments. So those are primarily two things. If I drove to something that would add color to that, certainly, what happened to June 30 is the price of the in-situ value of exploration properties, certainly, we’re much far below 25% to 35% below what we had this exploration potential on the balance sheet. So actually that’s why we stepped in indicators of impairment, took the impairment test, ran it and took the charge under IFRS, there’s nothing in the rule as far as we go forward, we wait for the fourth quarter to take charges. That’s when you have indicators of impairment you have to test. Then to your second question, we’ve tested all our assets and we’ve given lots of disclosures for headrooms of the other operations that we’ve tested for impairments, so it’s in the MD&A both in, as Anita said on just the previous question, even gave you some ideas on the cost structure of the various entities, to really say to the market where our headroom is with our other properties and capital projects.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. Mr. Jeannes, you may proceed, sir.
Charles A. Jeannes: Okay, thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I got to say, I’ve been quite gratified by the support and confidence of many of our shareholders during what’s been a pretty tough period in the gold market given this price volatility. And I think they continue to believe in our consistent long-term strategy. We have seen a partial rebound in the price of gold and other metals here recently, and I believe that the factors that are supported gold strong performance over the last decade will continue to feel a healthy market for our product. Yeah, I think, I said this last quarter, but I want to say it again. It has been said that you should never let a serious crisis go to waste, and I think this is important, because while this downturn has been painful, the changes that we are making in response to that, I think we’ll resolve in Goldcorp being an even stronger company going forward that is very well positioned for long-term success. So we look forward to taking on these challenges that we face and turn them into opportunities and certainly look forward to updating all of you in the third quarter on our progress. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. The conference call has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Incorporated 2013 First Quarter Conference Call for Thursday, May 2, 2013. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you, and welcome everyone to the Goldcorp first quarter conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; and George Burns, Chief Operating Officer. For those of you on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this afternoon’s discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes.
Charles A. Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are talking to you from Toronto where our management team and Board of Directors are gathered for our Annual General meeting to be held shortly after we do this call. We were pleased to begin 2013 on a positive note with gold production of 614,600 ounces in line with our expectations on track towards our production and cost guidance for the year. Revenues totalled about $1 billion with strong adjusted operating cash flow of $400 million. I recognized that our earnings were below consensus estimates for the quarter. As I said, we’re very comfortable with our guidance for the year, but we don’t provide quarterly guidance, and it’s clear that the quarter-to-quarter grade fluctuations, primarily around grade at Peñasquito can be hard for the market to anticipate. Mr. George will discuss the grade profile of Penasquito to give a little more insight into how the year will in full, significant, new subsequent for the end of the first quarter was the drop in gold prices in mid-April. So I want to spend a moment to address recent market dynamics and what lower metals prices may mean for the company. I believe what we’re seeing as a mid-cycle correction as opposed to a start of a bare market. And indeed the gold prices recaptured more than half of the $200 drop, were driven by significant physical buying and continued central bank [demand].
 : Our conservativism over the past years and how we financed our growth today provides us excellent flexibility in weathering lower gold prices. That flexibility means that we are not going to undertake major reactions to a short-term price move. That we run sensitivities as we always do, we are looking at spending priorities; determine where we would make reductions or deferrals in our spending programs in the event of a lower sustained price. We will continue to focus on our ongoing cost management initiatives, we see cautiously with respect to new capital visit. But our plans for the three growth projects under construction remain firmly in place. Total spending on Cerro Negro, Cochenour and Éléonore are now about 60% complete. And once in production, all three will bring high quality low cost production that will reduce our overall cost profile, that’s bringing down all in costs. These are projects that any prudent company would continue to build in this environment and we’re fortunate to have the employees to deliver value for our shareholders. Covering a few first quarter highlights, solid production drove revenues of $1 billion with operating cash flow $400 million and adjusted net earnings of $253 million. Beginning of the year, we increased the dividend again, $0.60 per share and we remain comfortable with our current dividend pay-out. We also added $1.5 billion in liquidity through the offering of five-year and ten-year unsecured notes at very attractive rates, demonstrating the financial strength of the company. Our total liquidity is now over $4 billion and our balance sheet leverage remains very conservative. Early in the year, but it’s important to confirm that we’re on track to meet our production guidance of between 2.55 million ounces to 2.8 million ounces this year with all in sustaining cost between $1,000 and $1,100. As stated in our January guidance release and again in our earnings release in February, our performance is weighted more heavily to the second half of the year. We’re maintaining our capital expenditure guidance of $2.8 billion and our exploration spend of $225 million also remains unchanged at this time. Regarding our cost guidance, we do expect cost to be higher this year than last due mostly to being in planned low-grade cycles of both Peñasquito and Alumbrera for most of the year. Those are temporary conditions. We fully expect our operating cost to improve significantly 2014 and for the rest of the five year plan. Over the longer term, our outstanding five year growth profile remains intact. Peñasquito and Pueblo Viejo will continue to contribute increasingly and new production from Cerro Negro, Éléonore and Cochenour will drive the 70% growth over the next five years. All the projects are advancing well through high quality assets that will deliver significant value to our company and our shareholders. And then beyond 2017, we have a number of advanced exploration projects including Camino Rojo near Peñasquito with the potential to become our next new growth projects. As I turn the call over to George for a review of the operations, I want to recognize the significant continued improvement of Red Lake where we’ve seen three consecutive quarters of very strong performance, and George over to you.

As I turn the call over to George for a review of the operations, I want to recognize the significant continued improvement of Red Lake where we’ve seen three consecutive quarters of very strong performance, and George over to you.
George R. Burns: Thanks, Chuck. Gold production in the first quarter totaled 614,600 ounces with Red Lake leading the way with production of 145,500 ounces. I’m happy with performance at mines which was as we expected and I’ll explain these results are expected to improve significantly over the year. At Red Lake, following the completion of the destressing work last year, we continue to have higher and greater flexibility in terms of stope availability, mine headings in the high grade zone. A single destressed slot is expected to be completed later this year with only about 5,000 ounces of 2013 production on its completion. We are off to a strong start at Red Lake. We have reaffirmed the production guidance of between 475,000 and 510,000 ounces. Exploration drilling continues on the newly discovered NXT zone which is adjacent to the High Grade Zone. The results indicate the zone remains open to the west and vertically. We have drills targeting this zone both from the 4199 exploration drift and from existing infrastructure at higher levels in the mine. Exploration development continues on the 47 level to provide closer drill access to this zone. At Peñasquito first quarter gold production totalled 60,100 ounces at a total cash cost of $611 per ounce. As expected, production decreased from the fourth quarter of 2012, as we were mining in the lower grade portion of the pit, which decreased our average grade from 0.55 gram per ton to 0.31 gram per ton. We’ll begin to mine higher grade in this new phase of the pit as the year progresses, with the result being increased gold production at declining cash cost. To give you a sense of the grade variability, we expect to see an increase throughout the year to approximately 0.6 grams per ton in the last quarter. Gold throughput in the quarter average to 103,660 tons per day remains on track to average 105,000 tons per day 2013, resulting in expected production of between 360,000 to 400,000 ounces for the year. Regarding the water supply at Peñasquito we are on schedule to complete the water and tailings studies in the first half of 2013. Studies are evaluating the development of new water sources as well as opportunities to reduce water consumption. I am happy to report that new water source has been identified within our current permitted basin with the potential to supply sufficient fresh water to continue ramp-up to full design capacity. On the longer-term, studies assessing the potential to source treated effluent water from the municipality of (inaudible) to help meet water demand both at Peñasquito and the potential new mining operations including Camino Rojo. The completed study is also expected to enable a decision on whether to perceive with the detailed feasibility study investigating the possibility of expanding and/or reconfiguring the existing tailings facility, in order to enhance water usage efficiency over the life of mine. At Camino Rojo, we are pleased to conclude negotiations and expand an agreement with Ejido San Tiburcio covering 2,500 hectares of land providing us with long-term surface rights, as well a five-year exploration agreement were also signed that provides permission to explore and drill on another 2,500 hectares of land. Exploration drilling is now resumed with six drills onsite performing infield growing of the West Extension. The bulk of the corp in these holes has been dedicated to metallurgical testing with sulfide and transition zones in the West Extension. During the second quarter, we’ll accelerate drilling of the West Extension with four additional drill rights. During the first quarter, our newest producing mine Pueblo Viejo produce 64,700 ounce of gold. The ramp up is progressing well towards full capacity in the second half of this year. The government of the Dominican Republic has asked Barrick on behalf of the Pueblo Viejo joint venture to accelerate and increase benefits that the government will derive from the mine. Barrick continues to engage in dialog with the government in an effort to achieve mutually acceptable outcomes. At Cerro Negro in Argentina, outstanding progress has been made on surface construction as well as ramp up of the underground. The Eureka decline has now advanced to over 2300 meters and the first drill production has commenced with the completion of the first (inaudible). The ore stockpile from Eureka now contains about 51,000 tons with expected grades of 11.7 gram per tonne and 220 gram per tonne of silver. Ramp development in the Mariana Central, Mariana Norte veins is also progressing on schedule. We expect to see ore production from Mariana Central in the second quarter from Mariana Norte in the third quarter. Detailed engineering is now at 92% of completion. Total EPCM is approximately 62%. The team is focused on meeting its schedule for first production late this year. However, we received the permit to commence construction of the power line that will buy into the grid later than expected. This delay could result in the first gold production being deferred into the first quarter of 2014. Here you can see the mill structure, which is taking shape quickly. At Éléonore (inaudible) activity continues to accelerate. The Gaumond’s exploration staff conversion from sinking to operating mode was completed, which has enabled mine development from the 650 meter level and the acceleration of diamond drilling activities at depth. The production staff has now reached a depth of 220 meters. The exploration ramp is now extended over 2,900 meters. The exploration of this quarter focused on in-fill drilling, the upper mine area, as will a total of 18,884 meters of diamond drilling was completed first strategic working platforms in the exploration ramp. Currently six drills are conducting definition and exploration drilling. Drilling has also begun on the lower portion of the mine. Here you can see a significant progress in construction of the mill building and its related infrastructure. Progress at Cochenour in the Red Lake district continues to progress. The haulage drift is now 71% complete with final completion expected by the end of this year. Two drills continue to work in the haulage drift to test the potential of the underexplored area above and below the drift. Underground exploration diamond drilling of the Bruce Channel Deposit will commence in the third quarter once the haulage drift is close enough and drilling platforms are excavated. With that, I will turn it over to Lindsay for a financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks George. Turning to the results of the quarter, I am really pleased with the financial performance of operating mines, financial disciplines we’re exhibiting around, building up our new mines. Before I get into the numbers, as we have previously mentioned on these calls and posted in our year-end statements of 2012, this quarter our financial statements and MD&A came references to non-GAAP disclosures, which in essence, contain the metrics of proportionately accounted for Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo, the details of which are outlined on Page 7 and Page 8 of our MD&A. We believe that in order to better assess the financial performance of the company, reviewing our financial results on a non-GAAP proportional basis rather than utilizing GAAP basis of equity accounting events is more relevant. First quarter in 2013 595,000 ounces of gold at an average realized price for ounce is $1622. The all-in sustaining costs $1,135 per gold out, resulting in the gross margin of some 30% versus 46% last quarter. The decline in our margin is due to primarily an increase in our all-in sustaining costs quarter-over-quarter. The costs are forecast to decrease throughout the remainder of the year, work through the planned lower grade material at Peñasquito and Alumbrera gets back on plan. By product cash cost were higher $565 per ounce compared to $360 per ounce in the prior quarter due to lower by-product revenues, planned lower production at Peñasquito, lower than expected performance at Alumbrera. Copper revenues were lower by some $56 million as a result of lower production in Alumbrera. Silver revenues decreased by $17 million due to reduced selling prices while zinc revenues decreased by $13 million primarily due to lower volumes sold in Peñasquito. On a coal product basis, cash cost increased to $710 per ounce a quarter compared to $621 prior quarter primarily due to lower ounces produced. All-in sustaining cash cost for Q1 2013 were $1,135 per gold ounce compared to $910 per gold ounce in the prior quarter. You are on track to meet the annual guidance of $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce. Details of this calculation were disclosed on Page 41 of our MD&A. Net earnings for the first quarter amounted to $309 million or $0.38 per share compared to $504 million or $0.66 per share in the prior quarter. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter amounted to $253 million or $0.31 per share compared to $465 million or $0.57 per share in the prior quarter. To calculate adjusted earnings, we adjusted our reported net earnings of $309 million by detecting this non-cash derivative gains of $41 million primarily associated with our convertible debt and removed the effect of the non-cash foreign-exchange gains, translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities $17 million book tax provision. Detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is posted on Page 42 of our MD&A. Consistent with previous quarters; we did not make any adjustment for non-cash share-based compensation expense which amounted to $18 million or $0.02 per share. The income tax provision included in our calculated adjusted earnings for the first quarter has an applied tax rate of 20%. Calculates the more meaningful effect rate one needs to have the book tax provision of $50 million for the quarter, foreign exchange gains on deferred taxes of $17 million, and income tax expense related to Alumbrera and PV $21 million. From the earnings before tax deduct $41 million of net mark-to-market gains from derivatives representing permanent differences as these items will never be taxable, this resulting in an effective tax rate of 45% for the quarter. The lower rate as compared to our guidance of 29% is due primarily to the positive tax impact that results Mexican inflation on tax guidance. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective rate would be 29%. Moving to provisional pricing, the impact of Peñasquito in the first quarter was a positive $2 million compared to a negative $20 million in the prior quarter reflecting a 1% increase in the realized prices to higher volume of sales at the end of fourth quarter of 2012 subject to pricing adjustments in the first quarter 2013. The end of the first quarter of 2013 Peñasquito provisional pricing volume will reflect 19,000 ounces of gold priced at $1598 per ounce, 1.4 million ounces of silver priced at $28.64 per ounce, 10.4 million pounds of lead price at $0.95 per pound, 31 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.85 per ounce. Alumbrera also benefited from positive provisional pricing impact of $4 million mainly due to higher realized copper prices. As at March 31, 2013 we have 27.6 million ton of copper to 25. During the quarter, the company generated adjusted operating cash flows of $400 million or $0.49 per share included as a reduction to those cash flows as this is usual in the first quarter, the true up of cash taxes at our Canadian mine on behalf of the 2012, 2013 next year amounting to $90 million or $0.11 per share. We invested $577 million at both of our operating mines and projects; hit a $122 million dividends. We’re ahead of where we expected to be in our financial plan for future, we under spent on our capital programs at the various mines, projects. However, we do expect to catch-up on the spend shortfall throughout the remainder of the year. As progressed at our capital projects continued to ramp up, made capital investments of some $322 million during the quarter at our growth projects, $255 million of sustaining capital at our operating mines. This year will be our peak year of new project capital spending Cerro Negro and Éléonore will have almost 75% of total capital spending relating to this project completed by the end of this year. Included in the $322 million spend with $152 million at Cerro Negro, $126 million at Éléonore. It is important that I point that we do have the ability to defer and reduce capital expenditures, explorations and G&A expenses for the year, get through was prolonged reduced coal price. With over $4 billion of liquidity, strong credit ratings of DDD+, DAA2, we are very comfortable we can fund our capital programs both at our operating mines and new projects and any foreseeable gold price scenario. It is prudent to have a strong balance sheet and a thoughtfully planned and flexible capital expenditure program that provides us the ability to manage the business with the optimal net of benefit of our shareholders. Lastly, we are comfortable with our guidance for 2013 we announced back on January 07. Gold production in 2.55 and 2.80 million ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $1,100 per ounce of gold, $525 to $575 per ounce of gold on a by-product basis, $700 to $750 per ounce of gold on a co-product basis. We also reconfirm the capital spending guidance $2.8 billion. We continue to believe that investing in our high growth projects, growing our production profile while at the same time ensuring we have the financial flexibility to maintain our strong balance sheet will provide the best return for our shareholders. With that, I’ll turn it back over to you operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Brian Yu from Citi. Please go ahead.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Thank you. Hi, Chuck, you guys had pretty good results as you highlighted. If you annualize a number, it seems like you have come in well below guidance. Can you discuss is there anticipated changes and great expectations contributing to that decline for the rest of the year or is somewhat related to destressed line that you are planning?
Charles A. Jeannes: I’m really sorry Brian. I don’t know whether it’s your phone or speakers here, we did not – I heard something at the end about destressed line of Red Lake. You would perhaps…
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Yeah, is this any better?
Charles A. Jeannes: A little better, yeah.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay. The Red Lake is outperforming for the year. So I am wondering what’s the factor that would attribute to equal results for the remainder relative to your full year guidance as it because of the distress slot that you are planning or something else.
George R. Burns:  No actually, this is George and actually the destress slot is really a minor issue in the year 2013. There is only 5000 ounces contingent on that destress slot. So, a good production in the first quarter as a result of the destress work we did last and it has given us much more flexibility in the high graded zone. In terms of the first quarter relative to our guidance for the year, its just normal fluctuations in the ore body in the mine plan.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Okay and my second question is you mentioned about the contingency plan there are any numbers that you do want to share with us behind that.
George R. Burns: Well not really, I mean we’ve run contingencies as we’ve always do during our budgeting process and we are going to dusted those off and looked at what we would do in a sustained $1,400 gold price environment, what we would do at $1,200 or below. And I can tell you, at 2014 none of our growth projects really changes, we certainly won’t miss this opportunity to look for some belt tightening around the organization in terms of G&A expenditures and looking at non-necessary projects around the organization. And I think there is some meaningful dollars that will come as result of that, but we have in mind what we would do in a contingency basis but we are not there, we are not – add a position with the gold price that we feel like we have to implement it.
Brian Yu – Citigroup: Thank you
Operator:  Thank you. The next question is from John Timothos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Timothos – John Tumazos Very Independent Research: I have two questions and thank you for taking me. First, in continuing you cost cuts at the stated by-product prices, should we infer that you expect silver to recover over $34 to average $34 and copper to recover over $350 to average $350, et cetera, et cetera. Or should we conclude that it’s just a line of word to start up the [Brazilian] mines and you haven’t read on your budget? Or thirdly, the ore grades or start up there are going to be so good in the second half to make up for the by-product crisis. And the second question, we calculated a 3.8% after tax return on assets in the first quarter. Marking them to last night’s metals prices and a normal tax rate, we got 1.5% return on assets. At today’s prices roughly what do you think your return on assets would be three years from now with all the mines built?
Charles A. Jeannes: Good morning, John. Let me refer with the first question. By confirming our cash cost guidance, you should infer primarily from that that our by- product production is going to increase significantly over the course of the year from where it was in the first quarter. When we talk about the grades of Peñasquito it’s not just gold grade, its silver, zinc and lead grade. And George went through the kind of increase we expect to see there over the course of the year and those proportions are roughly the same for what we see for the by-product. And as you know, those contribute a lot of revenue at Peñasquito. And similarly Alumbrera we are down in the first quarter and expect to recover and so we see significantly higher copper production later in the year. All of those things are taken into account in our by-product cost estimate and our sustaining cost estimate in total. In terms of the prices we assume, those are published to be have assume $30 silver not $34, $3.50 copper and $0.90 led and zinc. So we don’t think that there is any need to change our guidance based on current prices of those by-products. Second question, we would have to do some work to give you spot numbers in terms of our returns. But certainly we don’t look at returns on a quarter-by-quarter or day-by-day basis, because we make investments for long-term and it’s just not fair frankly to look at the performance this year or this quarter when we know we’re in a very low rate cycle at two of our mines, and then run that out for the light of the company and improve our rate of return that clearly wold be substantially lower than what we expect. Going forward, we target a pretax rate of return in excess of our cost of capital. So over 10% for our new investments and I think based on the numbers that have just been handed to me, the return on equity would be about 8% for the first quarter, if you look at our debt-to-equity ratio. Yeah, okay. Sorry, I’m getting into some of Lindsay’s numbers that he might want to talk to you. I hope that answered your question, John.
John Timothos – John Tumazos Very Independent Research: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Haughton from BMO. Please go ahead.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: 
 :
George R. Burns: So Q1 is definitely the low quarter for the year and in my prepared remarks the 0.6 approximate grade is the fourth quarter, middle of the year is going to be in between those two numbers is generally the guidance.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. So if I took a linear kind of view that sounds reasonable.
George R. Burns: Yes.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: And the other grade of course that were down were your bye product grades so that the silver, the lead and the zinc should we think about that having a similar percentage improvement over the course of the year nearly up more than 50% over the course of the year?
George R. Burns: Yes, generally the bye products are going to see the same sort of increase.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. You had also mentioned to the recovery issue and carbon content in particular. Am I correct in reading but it just happens to be the benches that you’re working through now and is a number that will go away business moving into deeper benches?
George R. Burns: Yeah if you take a look at our say last five quarters of production and take a look at head grade and recovery, you will see a pretty decent correlation between the recoveries in each metal, and the head grades in metal. So, yes in fact, in first quarter we’re mining the next phase of Peñasquito in top of the ore body, so we’ve done lower grade and lower recoveries going with those lower grades. On top of that, the carbon content was high in this area that also impacts recoveries, but as this push back gets deeper into the deposit, the head grade will increase significantly each quarter, and the recoveries will also increase.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets:  Okay. So it sounds like two items there, the fixed component and the carbon.
George R. Burns: That’s correct.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. Just switching to a different story now Cerro Negro had highlighted the potential with the start-up could slip out of 2013 into 2014, and that there may be additional pressure on the CapEx there, should we be thinking about this as a commercial start up more in the first or perhaps second quarter of 2014, or are you still comfortable with the earlier time in that?
Charles A. Jeannes: Hi Dave, this is Chuck. I guess two things there, one when we’ve been talking about all along first gold in late 2013, that wasn’t commercial production, always intended to take place in the first half of 2014, and we haven’t been more detailed in that in the guidance, because as you know there is accounting and completion tests that will need to be made and its hard to know today exactly when they will be. But more important point I think is that, what we tried to do is be very advanced in our guidance in terms of the fact that we still think that we hit first gold production in 2013 but there is a potential that we won’t because of things that are going on right now in terms of lining up contractor to complete the electrical installation there. As we said in the materials, the permit was issued later than expected and that has generated some question as to which contractor will do the work-in and when it will be completed. So, we’re just trying to be conservative here and let you know that there is the potential for it. But that’s not what we’re planning on today.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. And as far as the capital, I presume it is all tied up in that timeline as well, but should be we thinking that maybe it could be 10%, 15% higher than your 1.35?
Lindsay Hall:  While we don’t have a number for you because the primary impact is pushing expenditures into 2014 for which we haven’t made in an inflation as I said assumption. If you recall the, we talked a lot about this in our MD&A last quarter in Investor Day that we have assumed the 25% inflation rate in Argentina for 2013 with no corresponding devaluation of the peso. We think the devaluation is inevitable but there is no way of knowing when it will come so, we haven’t made those assumptions for 2014. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens, but if you push spending into 2014 and the inflation rate continues and there is no corresponding devaluation, we’re going to see a higher number.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from George Topping from Stifel. Please go ahead.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus:  Great, thanks and nicely coming on from that, given the peso inflation disconnected to mention. What cash cost per ton, are you suggesting for Cerro?
Charles A. Jeannes:  Papers are being slipped as we try to find that for you George. Yeah, these are current dollar estimates and so without trying to anticipate inflation or peso exchange rates for the rest of the mine life, I’ll give you to George?
George R. Burns: Yeah, so we’re looking at cost per ton mill of around $140 of ton.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, very good. And then on Peñasquito to the water study, the new water source, what timeline to access that would you think?
George R. Burns: So we’re actively completing those studies. We’re working on detailed engineering. I can’t give you a definite update. But I can tell you it’s in the same basin. We’ll be tieing into the existing well field infrastructure and so it’s a medium term type construction activity and we’ll have a lot more information on that next quarter.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus: It’s just to confirm that no new permits for it?
George R. Burns: No, we have the existing permits to meet our water needs within that basin and so this new well fields within our permitted area.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that’s good. And then just lastly, El Morro is featured in the MD&A and it looks like $17 million, which is spent on a ton, certainly what the budget for El Morro with this year is and whether it could be deferred?
Lindsay Hall:  Yeah, I can’t recall the exact budget. We’re looking that up for you George. It’s about $60 million with the original budget for the year and certainly that is one of the projects that you would look to should you want to defer some spending. And I think that’s far as I could go right now.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus: All right. The 60 million or so, do you know what is the – when is the baseline studies, or what security, or do what’s that relating to?
Lindsay Hall: It’s everything, it’s continuing the work to reinstate the permit, it’s engineering on looking for all of the optimization, add all of the optimization opportunities we have there, and it’s securing and maintenance of the site, there’s a lot that goes into that, no construction.
George Topping – Stifel Nicolaus: All right. Thanks, George. Thanks George.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jorge Mariano Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Good afternoon, guys. I guess my question is for Lindsay. Could you explain and talk to what led to the accounting treatment change at those two mines, and was there any particular trigger that changed the way you report them?
Lindsay Hall: No change in the way that as you would, to the agreements we have in running the mine, simply just change in accounting literature and IFRS has a view that you can’t proportionally consolidate. So nothing changed at (inaudible), but that accounting rules changed in 2013, we had to adopt that. And certainly with commercial operations at PV now, we had to adopt somewhere, but nothing has changed in the management agreements, just the accounting.
Jorge Mariano Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Right, and – but you guys have been on IFRS for over a year, so was that a change in the actual IFRS rules during 2013?
Lindsay Hall: That’s correct.
Jorge Mariano Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then may be my next question is for Chuck, could you, and again I don’t want to paint you into a corner here obviously but could you be a bit more specific about what you would consider, right now you are saying the gold collection is short-term in nature and a structural (inaudible) remains, but how many months or quarters would take of a low gold price for you to define that is being of a more permanent nature. In other words, would we expect perhaps 2013 to play out and then in 2014, if gold price is stable of 1,500 that you would affect some of these contingency cost cut plans.
Charles A. Jeannes:  That’s a good question Jorge. I don’t have a specific number of weeks or months in mind that you really have to look at all the facts and circumstances. And like we do all the time, try to do your best assessment of the market going forward on what we think it will be, but a couple of points. One, as I said, we never want to led a crisis go to waste and so there is an opportunity right now to do some belt-tightening around the organization and we are doing that and we are going to do it, and that’s kind of independent of gold price. Secondly, there is a series of actions that can be taken, first around deferral of capital spending and we look at it in terms of prioritization of – the first priority being things that won’t impact a five-year plan and the second priority being things that won’t impact the next two years and third priority being things that maybe will impact production as early as this year and next. And so as we look at those things, we look first at capital or not first, but add capital and then we also look at discretionary spending like exploration and further G&A reductions and the like. So there is a whole series of things that we’ll look at. I suspect if the gold price did not recover, it would be more of a continuum, I know it will be, more of a continuum than just deciding on a certain day that we are going to change everything because remember we do our long-term planning at a very low price to begin with, which is much lower than where we are today. So in terms of the long-term we’re very comfortable with our plans. So they be more of the shorter term deferrals to maximize cash and minimize the cash outlays.
Jorge Mariano Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Got it and so if you could remind me what gold price you run for your proven and probable reserves?
Lindsay Hall:  13.50
Jorge Mariano Beristain – Deutsche Bank: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Walker from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you, operator. Just a couple of questions, just on the earlier question on the water source for Peñasquito, my understanding is that drawn from the same aquifer that has been produced now which is a bedrock gravel aquifer, is that in fact the case?
Charles A. Jeannes:  Yeah we’re pumping out of alluvial aquifer in the Cedral space and mine and the new well field that I explored to is in the same basin on the north end of the valley.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: I guess the question is those aquifers are generally through rain water and recharge from surface or near surface waters. What is the – I don’t need another drought right, but I was curious what is the weather, the precipitations and like and the amount of rainfall, I know that we’re – too much of 2010, 2011, and 2012. I’m just curious how the recharge is going and whether do you feel that that is again going to be able to provide enough water for 130,000 tons a day over the next 12 to 24 months, 36 months.
Charles A. Jeannes: So I can’t tell you that the drought in the region is generally continuing, we haven’t seen rate increase and precipitation, but the existing well field which we currently rely upon have seen some drop down due to pumping, but the rest of the basin has not been impacted by our operations minimally impacted by the drop period. So the fact that we’ve got a new well field in another part of the basin gives us completely new place to rely on water is robust and its up and impacted with the operation today. So we’re feeling confident that this is going to be a good solution for sometime in the future, those studies as I mentioned aren’t complete we’ll have more details in next quarter.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks for that. It’s helpful. And just the detail feasibility study obviously is going to look at the reconfiguring of the existing tailings facilities, in order to have the water usage efficiency, can you explain what was – in the original design for the tailings is this an expansion of the tailings in anticipation of greater throughput is this just a reengineering of the retaining wells in the pumping system?
Lindsay Hall:  So the tailings pond goes to numerous expansions throughout the life of the Peñasquito operation. So that’s sort of normal. In the early design, in the plant that we’ve constructed, we have no thickeners in the tailings pond and the reason for that was the metallurgical work that was completed prior to production indicated that recoveries would suffer if water was recycled from thickeners right back into the plant.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Great.
Lindsay Hall:  So as the result of not putting in thickeners the water consumed by the tailings is significantly higher than it would be if we had thickeners. Now that we’ve been in operations for couple of years, we’ve done a lot of test for – that now shows that we would not have any kind of material impact on recovery we had a thickeners. The question is that we had thickeners then it changes the deposition methods of tailings that hasn’t impact on the design. So those are the things we’re working through. To understand, how do we optimize the use of thickeners and a new method to deploy tailings out into the pond? And so we’ll have a good idea in this, these studies that are being completed, what that looks like and whether or not we’re going to proceed more detail engineering on a tailings new design in order to reduce more consumption.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. And just one last question on Penasquito, you are commissioning the waste rock conveyor here into the second quarter. When do you expect it to be fully operational? And just as a follow-up to that, if you’re trailing three quarters, mining cost that Penasquito average to $1.19 a ton, what positive impact if any? Would you expect with that conveyor up and running on a per ton basis?
Charles A. Jeannes: So in terms of the ramp up, we’re fully commission and I expect that ramp up the full production happen in second and third quarter. In terms of the impact on cost, really what’s happening here is we’re – we put in the conveyor as the long-term investment in order to move waste, a long waste from the edge of the [mine] and outwards the tailings facility. So what that does is eliminates the requirement for us that add trucks throughout mine line. So I would describe it more as an investment to ensure cost don’t escalate over time, as we have to hauling further and further from the pit. So don’t expect our overall cost per ton to drop, but look at this as an investment to stop cost from increasing into the future.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Great.
Charles A. Jeannes: The real opportunity for our cost reductions really focused on our operating for excellence program and I can tell you we’ve got some really exciting things happening in Peñasquito in terms of focus on efficiencies and productivities in all phases of the operation but in particular, in the mining area.
Steven Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much for the details.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes – TD Securities: Yes, thanks operator. Chuck, rhetoric seem to be ramping up on behalf of the government. How do you see things evolving there? I understand this morning that the government may have halted shipments of gold from DR until there is an agreement.
Charles A. Jeannes: Well, Greg, I am unfortunately not able to go into any detail because there are as you can appreciate discussions ongoing almost as we speak and there has been a lot of back and forth and unfortunately there has been some public rhetoric around those discussions and – all I can say is I know Eric is the operator, he is working very hard on this. They’re working very closely with us and keeping us informed and we’re involved in the decision making around those discussions but until something gets to a point where there is definitive dews one way the other, there is really nothing more we can say.
Greg Barnes – TD Securities: Do you think it’s getting closer?
Charles A. Jeannes: I would assume the passage of time would get closer to some sort of resolution, yes.
Greg Barnes – TD Securities:  Okay, fair enough.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Good morning guys. So first question start with PV, the throughput there from quarter-over-quarter came down a little bit. Could you give me some insight into what happened there?
Lindsay Hall:  Yeah sure. As you know we had a number of retrofits we needed to implement in the autoclave circuits, and so we’ve now got three of the autoclave completed in the downtime was taken basically to make those retrofits. In fact, we have the fourth autoclave were retrofitted in the second quarter in the – in a really good position and continue to ramp up to full production in the second half.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: So I should have said the mining, the mining throughput tons of ore mined and I didn’t mean the plant is the process plant?
Lindsay Hall:  I mean that just a normal fluctuation in the ore body and the stripping, so nothing significant there.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then on grades and recovery at Marigold, I think you’ve talked about the leach pad and starting a new level on the leach pad, could you walk me through what’s going on there little confusing, I guess – around that?
Lindsay Hall:  Sorry I need Marigold is not one that we were prepared to...
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Nobody doing it.
Lindsay Hall:  Questions on. So give us just a moment.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Okay. So I’ll ask another question again then work as well the heat distribution issues that you had there with I guess with the solution there has that been resolved at this point?
Lindsay Hall:  Yeah, we have some issues with the distribution piping upon the leach pad and that has been fixed and we are on track there to hit our production for the year and back to Marigold, the ore closes with slightly up prior quarter more significantly the grades down and we’re in new fit in the top of the ore body with significantly ore grades and that really was the impact.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: Right, but I think in the first quarter, I mean if you look at the, I guess trying to back out what was going on in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, you’ve got, you hit around 55%, 56% heap leach recovery in 54%, and then you’re up above 110% in this quarter. So how should I think about recovery rates for rest of the year?
Lindsay Hall:  The recovery rates will be improving, and tied into our guidance for the year, we’re going to be on track.
Anita Soni – Credit Suisse: And then could you just I missed when you said the throughput of Penasquito, what you would get up to in terms of tons per day by the fourth quarter?
Lindsay Hall: Well, our current plan is sticking with the 105,000 tons a day. My comment was that with a new well field that we’ve found, we believe that’s going to allow us to get 130,000 tons a day, but it’ll only be once we get that new system constructed and tied into operation. That’s out into the future our guidance is still 105,000 tons for the year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Paretosh Misra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. First just going back to Penasquito, and what’s your throughput target rate for next year at Penasquito?
Charles A. Jeannes: Yeah we’re essentially sticking flat with that 105,000 tons a day to 110,000 tons a day into the future, until we complete the water studies and we understand the timing to implement those improvements.
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: And besides these improvements is there any other seasonality that we should be aware of looking on a quarterly basis?
Charles A. Jeannes: You’re talking Penasquito still?
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: Yeah.
Charles A. Jeannes: No really, it’s just head rate improving as the next phase, Phase 4 gets deeper into the ore body. We’ll see all the metal grades increase and recoveries improve throughout the year.
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: Got it; so no other maintenance outage other than some of the things that you described this year?
Lindsay Hall:  Correct
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: And one final question on Cerro Negro. In terms of labor force, are you almost at full capacity or there are more positions you need to fill?
Lindsay Hall:  No we’re still in the ramp up phase. We’ve got operators and we’re focused on getting into operating phase late in the quarter but we are still ramping up our work force both underground and for the plant.
Paretosh Misra – Morgan Stanley: Great thanks.
Lindsay Hall:  Yeah.
Operator:  Thank you, there are no further questions registered at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit:  Okay thanks operator and thanks everyone for joining us today. I do want to make one correction when I was asked about the moral capital spend for the year, the budget was actually 75 but the rest of my remarks would continue to apply. So thanks for joining in as I said at the outset, we are pleased with the start to the year. We do expect significant improvements in our production and cost and therefore financial results as the year progresses and we look forward to updating you in the second quarter. Thanks very much. 
Operator:  Thank you, the conference call has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Incorporated 2012 fourth quarter and year-end conference call for Friday, February 15, 2013. Please be advised this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations at Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you, and welcome everyone to the Goldcorp fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Among the senior management in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer, Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer, and George Burns, Chief Operating Officer. For those of you participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this morning's discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, and costs and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, CEO of Goldcorp.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks Jeff, and thanks everyone for joining us today. When we last spoke about five weeks ago in conjunction with the issuance of our guidance and fourth quarter production, I mentioned the strong finish we had in 2012 and indeed the fourth quarter saw a new record for gold production at 700,400 ounces. This led to quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion and operating cash flow before working capital of $721 million. This was a result strong effort from most of the mines and particularly both Red Lake and Penasquito. Gold grades at Red Lake drove a successful quarter and established a solid foundation for 2013. At Penasquito, all phases of the operation continued to improve and our confidence in the near-term water availability is increasing. We also believe that the water study underway will produce a solution that addresses our long-term needs for the Penasquito district. With the Pueblo Viejo joint venture achieving commercial production in January, the three linchpins of our 2013 performance are all headed in the right direction. Due to the board's confidence in the future of our business, we elected to increase the dividend for the fourth time in three years to $0.60 per share. So turning to the 2012 highlights. Production for the year was 2.4 million ounces at all-in sustaining cash cost of $874 an ounce. As I mentioned in January, all-in sustaining cash cost is a new metric we are adopting this year as are many of our peers in the industry. We believe this provides a more complete picture of the actual cost of producing an ounce of gold by including cash costs, sustaining thing capital corporate G&A, exploration expense and reclamation costs. Going forward, we will provide regular quarterly reporting on this metric in addition to our traditional reporting on cash costs as we transition to the new approach. As the World Gold Council continued its work toward adopting an all-in cost measure, we plan to conform to the industry standard. Turning to the growth projects, we are extremely well positioned with the portfolio of high return and low capital intensity projects that will add significant shareholder value. This portfolio is the product of several very good acquisitions and our longstanding commitment to financial discipline. All three projects remain on schedule and saw significant advancement throughout the year. So, as we start 2013, the growth is here. Pueblo Viejo drives approximately 10% production growth this year and Cerro Negro starts late this year and supplies additional growth in 2014. Then we round out with Eleonore starting late next year and Cochenour in the first half of 2015. The net result is outstanding 70% production growth over the five-year plan based on these well advanced construction projects. During the year, Goldcorp's commitment to creating sustainable value for all stakeholders was underscored by our addition to the Dow Jones sustainability index North America, and we are proud of track record of working safely and responsibly in the communities where we operate. As final highlight to 2012, we announced yesterday our ninth consecutive annual gold reserve increase driven by both, our newest and oldest asset. Drilling success throughout the year at Cerro Negro resulted in another significant increase in reserves, which have nearly tripled since the asset was purchased in 2010. We're early in the exploration efforts of this large land package and we expect significant additional reserve growth there for years to come. Positive reserve increases were also turned in Marigold in Nevada and Porcupine in Timmins. Uncovering new value at these more mature assets is a testament to the overall quality of our exploration programs. Increasing the amount of gold reserves that each of our shares represents is one of the most efficient ways of adding value for shareholders and we are proud of our track record of explorations success. On a per-share basis, proven and probable gold reserves increased another 3.5% this year. It's important to point out that only about 24% of the reserve increase was due to increasing the reserve calculation price with the rest coming through the discovery of new ounces. And equally important is that we added reserves while maintaining our overall reserve grade. Testament to the fact that we are focused on maximizing not the overall number of ounces in reserves, but the value and quality of those ounces. The 2015 guidance we presented in January shows double-digit increase in production, compared 2012 to between 2.55 million ounces to 2.8 million ounces of gold the somewhat wide production range based into account for ramp up at Pueblo Viejo in its first full year of production. This guidance reflects a rigorous risk management process implemented to more effectively assess the risks in our business. Risks are more fully quantified and probability weighted to derive a range. We believe the result of these efforts is a forecast that properly challenges are sized to be their best, but also provides them the framework to succeed. With this new framework comes a major opportunity for our mine leadership teams to pursuit improvements in their business that go well beyond simply producing ounces. This process, which we are calling Operating for Excellence sees to identify and unlock value that exist throughout the organization in the form of greater efficiency, productivity and ultimately cost management. We look forward to sharing our progress with all of you on this initiative throughout the year. The other point to be made with respect to our guidance on costs, we are most certainly looking at a high watermark our costs in 2013 compared to the rest of five-year plan due to both, Penasquito and Alumbrera working through planned low-grade cycles this year. With our three growth projects under construction making strong advances this year 2013 is also likely to be a high watermark in terms of capital spending at a forecast $2.8 billion. This spending plan places us on a clear path towards free cash flow in 2014 and beyond. The five-year guidance we presented in January shows our project pipeline is expected to drive an approximate 70% growth in production to between 4 million and 4.2 million ounces. These are quality ounces, the addition of which will lower our overall cash cost. As you can see our dividend has increased 233% from 2009 from an annual dividend of $0.18 per share to $0.60 per share. Our focus has always been on creating shareholder value and I believe we can continue to balance investing in our growth profile while at the same time providing a meaningful dividend to our shareholders. In closing, this call is necessarily about reporting on our 2012 performance but the real excitement lies ahead of us. We have worked out the challenges of 2012 and I am confident that our current path will lead us towards increasing shareholder value. Our long-term strategy remains sound combining current low-cost operations with new high quality growth projects supported by an outstanding net cash balance sheet and little overall geopolitical risk. So no revamping of our strategy is needed. Instead our focus is squarely on execution, delivering value by meeting forecasts, containing costs and delivering our growth projects as planned. That’s exactly what we plan to and I look forward to updating you on our success over the course of the year. With that I will turn the call over to George.
George Burns: The key takeaways from the fourth quarter from an operational perspective are that Red Lake and Penasquito finished strong and the work completed last year provides a solid foundation for the future. In addition, Pueblo Viejo is on track to meet our expectations in 2013. These developments, when coupled with the stable overall mine portfolio underscore our confidence in executing successfully to our plan. Working with our mining project teams, I am excited by the many opportunities we have to add value by focusing on innovation, automation, efficiency and productivity improvement. Our operating for excellence culture will reduce cost by harnessing our highly engaged workforce to identify and prioritize opportunities, plan the required changes and then execute and sustain the improvement. I am passionate about creating value from continuous improvement throughout my career and the increased focus of my operating team going forward has me confident and excited. Gold production in the fourth quarter reached a record 700,400 ounces, an increase of 18% over the third quarter driven by strength at most of our mines including Red Lake and Penasquito, Los Filos and Porcupine. At Porcupine, production was 74,100 ounces in the fourth quarter for a total of 262,800 ounces for the year. The increase was driven by higher grades over the prior quarter. Los Filos production for the quarter was 92,800 ounces which is led by a record year of production of 340,400 ounces. This resulted from higher ore process. Chuck has mentioned our success in growing gold reserves again this year and I will include some of the relevant information around continued exploration success as I review the portfolio in more detail. At Red Lake, fourth quarter production totaled 168,300 ounces and 507,700 ounces for the year. Following the completion of de-stressing the 45 level in the third quarter, stope availability and mine headings in the high grade zone resulted in particularly high grade in fourth quarter showing once again the exceptional strength of this ore body. During 2013, at Red Lake there is only one destress slot at the 46, 47 level, which is expected to be completed in the second half. The majority of the production forecast for 2013 is not contingent on the completion of this destress slot. Production for the year is expected between 475,000 to 510,000 ounces. On the exploration front, the NXT Zone discovery in 2012, also potential to enhance operational flexibility at Red Lake over the next several years. We reported a small initial gold resource this year and drilling in 2013 will focus on expanding this resource. Five drills will continue to define and extend the zone above into the West of the 54 level with the objective of this year of identifying the up-plunge extents. Construction is progressing on an exploration drift at the 47 level with expected completion by the end of the first quarter in 2013 that will provide a platform to increase drill density for conversion of resources to reserves. In addition to the NXT Zone drilling also confirmed the extension of our High Grade Zone between 52 and 57 levels. In 2013, the focus will be on infill drilling between 48 and 55 levels that convert resources to reserves. We will also follow up on a new discovered structure at the bottom of the 4699 ramp. At Penasquito, fourth quarter gold production totaled 112,900 ounces at a total cash cost of $17 per ounce. As expected, production decreased from the third quarter as we commenced mining in a lower grade portion of the pit which will continue through the first half of this year. Mill throughput averaged 99,000 tonnes per day during the quarter. Throughput is expected to increase to an average of the 105,000 tonnes per day in 2013 as we are bringing additional water wells in production within the Cedros Basin in addition to new dewatering wells within Chile Colorado pit. This is expected to result in gold production of between 360,000 to 400,000 ounces for the year. A water and tailings management studies are underway and on track for completion in the first half of 2013, a study is investigating a combination of new long-term water sources as well as opportunities to conserve water to determine the most cost-effective solution of all operating increase in design throughput. The study is advancing and we look forward to updating you in the near future. We also continue to look for ways to increase efficiencies and reduce costs at site. One such project has been the Waste Rock Overland Conveyor, where construction is now complete and we are in the pre-commissioning phase with ramp-up expected during the second half of 2013. The team has identified numerous other opportunities to enhance efficiencies at site. Reserves at Penasquito decreased to 15.7 million gold ounces consistent with depletion. With the core Penasquito deposit well defined, the exploration focus in 2013 is a on testing deep strong material relating to copper mineralization and adjacent to the current open pit, Preliminary results show that the sulfide horizons contained copper, zinc, gold and silver. Other field in the Penasquito district, Camino Rojo project saw the successful conversion of resources to reserves of 1.6 million ounces of gold. It is important to point out that these reserves comprised the oxide heap leach project only and do not take into account the growing sulfide opportunity at depth. Our newest producing asset, Pueblo Viejo produced 43,700 ounces to our account in quarter. The ramp up is progressing towards full capacity in the second half of this year. Following modifications to the first autoclave the team insiders commenced implementing modifications to remaining three autoclaves, which are expected to be complete in the first half of 2013. Production for the year is expected between 330,000 and 435,000 ounce on a 40% basis. The power plant which will provide a stable energy to the site is anticipated to commence operations in 2013 also. Turning to Cerro Negro, the future of this robust project is getting closer. Construction and development is advancing towards first gold at the end of this year, progress on planned construction included completing excavations, large concrete pours for building foundations, based and walls. I am really pleased by the underground operating team, which is consistently executing for underground development plans. The Eureka decline now has advanced to 2,100 meters out of a total of 3,900 meters. The ore stockpile from Eureka now contains 40,300 tonnes and an expected grade of 11.1 grams per tonne gold and 204 g per tonne silver with expected stope production in the first half of this year. Ramp development in Mariana Central and Mariana Norte veins is also progressing on schedule. I think the press release stated that detail engineering was 55% complete but it is actually 88% complete and the ball mill and related equipment are on site. We increased our reserves significantly and we will continue with another strong exploration program during 2013 that will focus on further extending the Mariana Central, Mariana Norte and San Marcos veins to the East and drill testing of other vein targets. Here you can see the first steel going up on the mill building a few weeks ago, which will advance quickly now that we have the majority of the key concrete work complete. At Eleonore, the Gaumond's exploration shaft was completed and is now going through the conversion from sinking to operating mode with completion expected this quarter. Once completed it will enable mine development from the 650 meter level and acceleration of diamond drilling activities at depth. Engineering, procurement and construction management is now at 44%. The exploration ramp has extended over 2,500 m with four drills conducting definition of exploration drilling from strategic working platforms in the ramp. Underground exploration drilling will accelerate in 2013, enabling further definition drilling of the deep portion of the Roberto deposit. Following completion of further work of mine planning and initial development, the capital estimate has been confirmed at $1.75 billion. Construction continues to advance at Cochenour in the Red Lake district. The haulage drift is now 68% complete and final completion is expected in the first quarter of 2014. First gold is expected in the first half of 2015 as a study of the overall project concluded that the Bruce channel ore body is lower than previously expected which will require the deepening of the shaft by an additional 245 meters. Overall I am pleased how we finished the year and confident about the year ahead. After five months in my new role, I am really excited about my team executing our business plan that is founded on are highly engaged employees, a strong foundation of operating mines and several high-quality, low-cost projects are advancing quickly towards production. With that I will now turn it over to Lindsay for the financial review.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks George. Building on the third quarter momentum, the fourth quarter closed with strong production of some 700,000 ounces of gold. We reported revenues of $1.4 billion during the quarter, resulting in full year 2012 revenues of over $5.4 billion of which 87% results form selling precious metals, 2.3 million ounces of gold and 31 million ounces of silver. Operating cash flow before working capital changes increased to $721 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in full year operating cash flows of some $2.4 billion. $719 million was invested in our operations and capital projects this quarter, resulting in a full year total investment in our operating and capital project of $2.6 billion, right in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of 2012. Our average realized price per ounce of gold sold in the fourth quarter was $1,692. While our all-in sustaining cash cost were $910 per gold ounce, resulting in all-in sustaining gross margin of 46%. On a full year basis, our average realized price per ounce of gold sold was $1,672. All-in sustaining cash cost were $874 resulting in all-in sustaining gross margin of 48%. By-product cash cost increased to $360 per ounce in Q4 from $220 per ounce in Q3, primarily due to lower by-product sales credits at Alumbrera as a result of a lower sales volume in Q4. As you will recall, during Q3, Alumbrera sold most of its Q2 production in Q3. On a full year basis, by-product cash cost increased to $300 per ounce compared to $223 per ounce in 2011, primarily due to increases in production cost experienced industry-wide. All-in, sustaining cash cost for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 were $910 and $874 per gold ounce, respectively, and include by-product cash cost sustaining capital, corporate administrative expenses, reclamation cost accretion and exploration expense. On the webcast slide, we have included some additional details as to the breakdown in 2012 operating cost per ounce of $300, which is included in the all-in sustaining cash cost number of $874. As you can see, labor cost is approximately 30% of the $300 per ounce. As the all-in sustaining cash cost measure seeks to reflect the total cost of gold production from current operations, new project capital is not included in the calculation. The details of this calculation are disclosed on page two of our NDA. Reported net earnings for the fourth quarter amounted to $504 million compared to $498 million in the prior quarter and for the full year $1.8 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2011. Our adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased to $465 million, or $0.57 per share compared to $441 million or $0.54 per share in the prior quarter. To calculate the adjusted net earnings, we adjusted our reported net earnings of $504 million by deducting the non-cash derivative gains $128 million, primarily associated with our convertible notes and adding back revisions in estimates on the reclamation and closure costs of the company's inactive and closed mine sites of $60 million. As always we also review the items the non-cash foreign exchange losses on the translation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $22 million from the booked tax provision. The detailed calculation of our adjusted net earnings is disclosed on pages 45 and 46 of our MD&A. Consistent with the previous quarters, we did not make any adjustment for non-cash share-based compensation expense which amounted to $10 million or $0.01 per share. The income tax provision included in our calculated adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter, an implied effective tax rate of 25%. For the most part, we calculate this effective rate, the book tax provision of 149 million for the quarter is adjusted for the foreign exchange losses on deferred taxes, 22 million as well as the tax impacted revisions in estimates on the reclamation and closure costs other index of sites of $24 million. The earnings before tax of $653 million is also adjusted to remove the impacts of the share-based compensation expense of $10 million, the 122 million of net mark-to-market gains, primarily from the convertible note, representing permanent differences as these items will never be taxable and $84 million related to the revision in estimates on the reclamation and closure cost of the company's inactive mine sites. Compared to our 2012 guidance of 28% the actual effective tax rate during quarter reflects the positive impact that Mexican inflation had our tax volumes. Adjusted net earnings for 2012 was $1.6 billion, or $2.03 per share compared to $1.8 billion, or $2.22 per share in 2011. Compared to 2011, adjusted net earnings were impacted by higher production cost, partially offset by higher by-product sales revenues, resulting from higher sales volumes. Turning to provisional pricing, the impact of Penasquito in the fourth quarter was a negative $20 million compared to a positive $4 million in the prior quarter, reflecting lower metal prices realized in the fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter 2012, and you've seen the provisional pricing volume will reflect 52,400 ounces of gold priced at $1,664 per ounce, 2.7 million ounces of silver priced at $29.95 per ounce $16.8 million pounds of lead price of $6 to account and 43.2 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.92 per pound subject to the two-month provisional pricing career. Alumbrera was also impacted by negative provisional pricing of 4 million compared to a positive $6 million in the prior quarter mainly due to lower realized copper prices and at the end of the fourth quarter we had 34.8 million pounds of copper priced at $3.50 per pound. The company generated operating cash flows before working capital in the fourth quarter of $721 million or $0.89 per share, an increase of $34 million when compared to $687 million or $0.85 per share in the third quarter. After changes on working capital amounts, operating cash flows are positively impact the settlement fourth quarter accounts receivable related to the resumption of sales in the third quarter at Alumbrera. As progress continued at our capital projects, we made capital investments of some $719 million during the quarter, approximately $228 million in our operating mines and $491 million at our growth projects. Included in the $491 million spend, is a $119 million at Pueblo Viejo, $134 million at Cerro Negro, $186 million at Eleonore and $28 million at El Morro and lastly $24 million at Cochenour. Lastly, I am happy to report that both year was $900 million in cash. This, in conjunction with our undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility provides us with great liquidity and supports our strong investment grade balance sheet. With that, I will turn it back over to the operator. John, for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) First question is from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Thanks, Chuck and everybody. Well, congratulations on the results there. It is quite difficult to find things to ask questions until last night. Everything look nice. But one thing was intriguing was the use of $1,350 gold price in your reserve calculation. I wonder if Charlie was holding something back there?
Charles Jeannes: Sorry, I didn’t understand.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: The gold prices that you used to calculate your results, $1,350? some of the other guys are using the maximum, the $1,500.
Charles Jeannes: Well, this is consistent with the way we are trying to run the business and being disciplined and not trying to maximize the last ounce we can, either in our reserve calculation or production but to go after calling ounces. So. I don’t think it's any differently if you look at the way we compared in terms of our long-term price assumptions in the past and actual spot prices. We are in right around the same range as have been. So for us, there hasn’t been any change there, John.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Okay, great, and then following on from that and topical for today. There is a little bearish commentary, Chuck around in the market. Just wondered if you could talk about contingency plans if gold were to fall off sharply. I know you guys have an ongoing contingency plan in having low-cost operations but what should we expect from the industry as low prices continue?
Charles Jeannes: Well, I can only speak for us. I could certainly tell you that we sensitize everything we do looking at what would be the impact of lower sustained prices. I think that’s the key. I said earlier this year a couple times that it wouldn’t surprise me to see some volatility in the gold price and to see some weakness in fact because I believe there is some ways some artificial exuberance about international economic activity right now that is not likely to last throughout the course of the year. For example, we look at our reserves down to $1,200 and you would see about 6% decrease only in reserves at $1,000. The go down around 15%. So certainly not something that’s significant. I think overall, as I said, I don’t expect this current weakness to continue. I am still very much a believer in the long term trend in the gold price and it seems to me that all of the macroeconomic factors that have supported that continue very much in place, if not even more so than they have been in the past in terms of the debt levels for countries around the world, the likelihood of inflation down the road or at a minimum of the base in currency. So, yes, I can't say what other folks would do but we are very comfortable that the business will run quite well even at lower prices although we don’t expect it to be sustained.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Well done, guys. Congratulations.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks, John
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Hi, guys. I guess my question is for Chuck. We have seen some notable announcements in the gold space and mining space in general about the potential for slimming down of portfolios and in that environment would we be right to consider Goldcorp a potential buyer of assets if in fact there is more willing sellers out there?
Charles Jeannes: While we are always on the lookout for opportunities as you know have a pretty active corporate development department and I think we've made, as I said during my prepared remarks, some pretty solid acquisitions that are now in the process of adding real value to us in terms of Cerro Negro and Eleonore and Cochenour, and so yeah we'll keep our eyes on things. I can say it's a general matter. The things that others tend to want to dispose on would probably not be realized on our list. There are things that we would like to buy, but we will look at opportunities that are presented.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Then just as a follow up to that, could you talk a little bit about the quality if you have noted that from your development department of the bid/ask spread out there it would seem that the market is not attributing a lot of value to companies that are now saying they might be selling assets and I am just trying to understand if you are seeing a real widening of the bid/ask spread there or if assets you said are maybe [what the is at high] quality to generate interest.
Charles Jeannes: Yes. It's hard for me to say, because I don't know what people are seeing in terms of the various bids for their assets. That is the process that to the extent we are involved, which is very limited, we are only seeing one side of that discussion, so you would have to ask that posters selling the asset.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Fair enough thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The question is from Patrick Chidley from HSBC Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Securities: Hi, everybody. Just a quick question on your developments down in Argentina, I was wondering what's impact you are having or seeing from inflation in Argentina there and why you see Argentinean inflation right now?
George Burns: Hi, Patrick, as we said in January, we were disappointed to have a pretty significant increase in capital cost at Cerro Negro and the large majority of that increase came from what we call Argentina factors or local factors that was the inflation rate and which was running in the range of 25% and the other side of it was the difficulty of importing equipment and materials into the country and the cost and times delay that that added to us, but the good news is that we've managed those issues and our numbers that we provided you assume continued inflation without any meaningful reduction in the exchange rate or adjustment in the exchange rate, so eventually there has got to be some corresponding devaluation of the peso and we haven't seen that yet. And otherwise the guys are doing a very good job of managing and advancing the project and things are going quite well, but it is a challenging environment.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Securities: Thanks. Any impact on Alumbrera?
Charles Jeannes: Yes, but it's the inflation rate and so you've seen some movement in the cost at Alumbrera. I do not actually have breakdown as to the difference between the inflationary factor in fact it is mind just getting deeper and that you got to move rock further than you did before, but as you can see Alumbrera continues to be a very strong cash going asset and so it as well has managed those impacts.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Alec Kodatsky from CIBC. Please go ahead.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just to fill in a few holes, a few questions, but just going back to I think good afternoon just weeks, pupils a few questions but am just going back to Cerro Negro you noted that you are still looking for government approval in the power line towards the end of March. Just sort of curious sort of the of genesis of that approval and does it require approval by March or is there a longer timeline behind that before you actually need the power?
George Burns: This is George. Yes. We've got a few months to get the power line started to be consistent with our start up at the end of the year. we are comfortable with the permit process, but that is going to be changed.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: I guess probably another question for George just maybe an update in terms of how the refurbishment of autoclaves are going at PV? I know its only been a month since we last talked but any insight there is helpful.
Charles Jeannes: Sure. The first autoclave, the retrofits are working well and that gives us confidence that our guidance and our plans for the years is intact. The second autoclave, the retrofits have been completed and that line will be starting up within a week. We are on track to get the last two autoclaves completed in the first half of the year. So things are looking well.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Then probably a question for Lindsay. It seems the number of different definitions for expenditures and just wanted to clarify where you are placing capitalized stripping and development? Would that be in a sustaining bucket? Or is that in the project capital and other bucket?
Lindsay Hall: In sustaining, Alec.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Okay. I would hope so but just wanted to check.
Lindsay Hall: It is like just following on that, Alec. I mean that’s one of our real reasons for adopting the all-in cost measure, is that stripping and development work at our mines is a real cash outlay every year and it should be counted, and it should be paid just as much attention to in our internal work and externally as the operating costs are. So, yes, they are definitely included.
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Okay, no, its just a clarification. I do appreciate that. Thanks.
Lindsay Hall: That's all?
Alec Kodatsky - CIBC: Yes, I am all done. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Steve Butler from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
Steve Butler - Canaccord Genuity: Hello, good afternoon, guys. It was a wonderful Q4 to see 27 odd grams per ton, Chuck. That annualized at ridiculous 670,000 ounces a year but question for you guys as to whether Q4 was a particularly obviously very heavy high-grade zone quarter and perhaps it was on a run rate overly influential in the quarter. Would that be a reasonable assumption?
Charles Jeannes: Perhaps I would let you talk to George in a minute but as you know, Red Lake has variability based on grade and at times you are in a low-grade area of the high-grade zone or lower grade. Other times you get into some really nice stopes. So that was the case in the fourth quarter which, as George said, continues to show what an outstanding deposit it is. But I will pass it to him.
George Burns: Hi, Steve. The first half of the year, one of the impact we have was the destress slot timing and our ability to get into some of these high grade stopes. So by getting all that work completed in the third quarter really opened up the mine in the high-grade zone and that flushed out some of the production in higher grade fourth quarter. So, yes, it was a really strong quarter. As I said, Red Lake is an exceptional mine and we expect to see quarters in the future like that again. We are comparable with our guidance for the year.
Steve Butler - Canaccord Genuity: All right, okay. That’s good, that’s fine. Then, Chuck on your opening remarks somewhat, you talked a bit about your confidence towards creating and finding long-term solutions to the water and tailings water program management, if you will. Maybe what gives you that confidence? I am assuming your studies are not, perhaps, even nearing completion, you talked about it being delivered by the first half and so maybe if you could give us a bit more color there, if you don’t mind, unless we have to wait for the study?
Charles Jeannes: Well, you do. The great thing about being CEO is I get to make broad statements about how things are going well and then George gets to explain them. So I am going to pass that over.
George Burns: Yes, Steve. I mean one of the confidence issues is that we have been expanding the well field on the property we control currently and as we have completed those wells and understand the water that will be delivered are confident and our guidance this year has increased. So I am feeling a lot better about things now than I was three months ago just due to that success. In terms of a longer-term plan, both the studies advancing, we are on track, in terms of timing and we will work on our way through finishing the study and drawing our conclusions. So for that you are going to have to stay tuned.
Steve Butler - Canaccord Genuity: Okay, thanks guys.
Charles Jeannes: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions. I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Jeff.
Jeff Wilhoit: Okay, thanks everyone. We certainly appreciate that we just spoke to you for a little while ago about these issues. So what thanks for the questions we did have and thanks for joining us today. As you heard from all of us, we are quite excited about the year ahead and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our first quarter conference call. So have a good weekend. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The conference call has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-02 13:00:00) =====
Executives: John Seaberg - Vice President of Investor Relations Richard T. O'Brien - Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director Russell D. Ball - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Gary J. Goldberg - President and Chief Operating Officer
Analysts: John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer; Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Operating Officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive leadership team. Turning to Slide 2. Before we get into the quarterly results, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. We'll begin our discussion on Slide 3. Q3 was another solid quarter of delivering balanced performance from our operating portfolio. For the quarter, we reported positive results in 2 regions: in Nevada, resulting from higher grades and higher leach tonnage; and at Yanacocha, where recoveries and grades were higher than expected. These positives were partially offset, as announced in October with our production and sales results, with some challenges in our APAC region, primarily at the Tanami mine and Boddington in Australia. Gary will discuss our operating results in greater detail a bit later. We remain on-track to meet full year production guidance for 2012, although likely at the low end of the 5 million to 5.1 million ounce range. Primarily due to the slightly lower estimated production levels, we've also narrowed our CAS outlook range for the year to between $650 and $675 per ounce, and it's likely we'll end up towards the higher end of that range. We continue to make progress on reducing our total cost, as we spoke with you about at our Investor Day in May. The value enhancement program is designed to identify and eliminate redundancies and efficiencies -- and inefficiencies, sorry, throughout our company to provide increased financial returns. We continue to focus not only on reducing the upward trend in our operating cost, but in all other areas of the business as well. While this focus is not new for us, we have several new and/or growing capabilities in this area. Recent advances in consolidating our existing ERP platforms into one platform will, over time, eliminate some of the current duplication we have in regional and corporate functional overheads. That consolidation will also allow us to move into a shared service environment for many of those functions, providing a highly leverage-able model that will increase how efficiently we can support our operating team. Gary Goldberg, our President and COO, has already brought a renewed effort into more effectively and efficiently delivering the substantial technical capabilities that reside in Newmont, while also demanding stronger technical foundations so that we can deliver more predictable mine planning models and more closely connect those models to expected cash flow from our business models. In our exploration area, we will continue to target annual reserve additions to offset depletion while spending less than we did in 2011 and improving our returns from that portion of the business. And finally, in our projects area, our value assurance group, under Russell Ball and Tom McCulley's leadership, is delivering new capabilities to evaluating our project portfolio, allowing us to cut out earlier projects that don't make economic sense, and to more fully evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of those projects where we continue to invest. Russell can talk some more about the progress we're making on reducing costs in a moment. While it's clearly a step in the right direction to reduce our capital spending, G&A, exploration and advanced project costs in 2012, as we're doing, we acknowledge this is just a start, and we will come out with additional cost savings targets next year. On to Slide 4. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average P.M. Gold Fix of $1,652 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of roughly 2.5%. So far this year, we've paid out approximately $520 million, which is 62% more than we did for the same period last year. So we are focused on profitable production, disciplined returns and returning capital to shareholders. And from a return of capital standpoint, our gold price-linked dividend provides leverage without the cost of holding physical gold or ETFs. And the payout structure benefits shareholders as the price of gold rises, providing additional leverage to the gold price without the cost of owning physical gold or ETFs. And we believe that the price of gold can and will go higher, which will lead to a greater payout for our shareholders. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Russell Ball.
Russell D. Ball: Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the third quarter details, I wanted to step back and take a couple minutes to give you our perspective on the gold market and how our thinking in that regard has shaped our view on the capital structure of the company and the related return of capital to shareholders. In early 2011, when we outlined our growth plan, we knew that 2012 and 2013 going to require significant CapEx, and that with the gold price-linked dividend, debt service obligations and the significantly lower cash flow out of Batu Hijau in 2012 and 2013, we fully expected to be in a negative free cash flow position for these years. A number of analysts have picked up on this and have commented on the sustainability of the dividend in light of this negative free cash flow in the short term. However, we have to manage this capital-intensive business for the long term. As we looked out beyond 2013, we saw significant free cash flow generation as production ramped up and CapEx decreased even at our conservative $1,500 an ounce gold price assumption. With now moderated growth plans due to the issues in Peru, reduced CapEx, an ongoing focus on total cost-reduction and a substantially higher than budgeted gold price, we're almost $1 billion ahead of where we expected to be on a free cash flow basis when compared to the 2012 budget. So in short, the strength of the balance sheet and our ability to sustain the current dividend is a function of the gold price, and we remain bullish for a number of reasons, a couple of which I want to touch on briefly. The chart on Slide 5 puts the current 10-year-old gold bull market in perspective and compares it to the last bull market in the '70s. I would submit that gold's run over the past decade, as represented by the red hash line on the chart, has been relatively pedestrian versus the last gold bull market represented by the gray line, especially in light of the broader macroeconomic challenges that we face in today's global economy. A classic bubble this bull is not. We think the gold price has a long way to run, especially if you take this analysis and look at it in real terms instead of nominal prices. Today's spot price of around $1,700 an ounce remains approximately 30% below the inflation-adjusted average, depending on which index you use as a measure of inflation, seen in 1980, the peak year of the previous bull market. Turning to Slide 6. We'll see the impact of just one of the broader macroeconomic factors, namely the collective monetary policy response to the global financial crisis that commenced in '08. The chart shows the rapid growth in central bank balance sheets as a percent of GDP in purple on the left-hand axis with the gold price in gray on the right-hand axis. The major central banks responded to crisis after crisis by providing essentially unlimited liquidity and almost 0 cost in nominal terms or significantly negative rates in real terms. Not surprisingly, we have seen asset prices from housing to farm land in Iowa to global equities to gold react in the way they have despite a very challenging global macro environment. That the price of gold, in particular, has responded by tracking global liquidity, shouldn't be a surprise since it is the one currency whose supply is limited and can't be created by electronic printing presses. For this and a number of other reasons we don't have the time to discuss on this call, but which include the inherent primary supply deficit of 1,800 tons a year, central banks returning as net buyers in size, the establishment of the gold ETF market and producers no longer selling forward, we are bullish on gold prices. It's our job as management to do a better job at delivering this gold price leverage to the bottom line, and we are focused on that. Shifting to the third quarter and year-to-date operating results on Slide 7. Attributable gold and copper production was down from the prior year quarter, largely due to the ongoing Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau and ongoing challenges at Tanami. The quarter production was also below budget as we did expect to mine high-grade Phase 5 ore from the bottom of the pits at Batu Hijau this quarter. However, due to the wall failure in April, we weren't able to access this material. We realized $1,659 an ounce with operating costs up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $693 an ounce, resulting in an operating margin of $967 an ounce or approximately $107 lower than the prior year quarter. We'll touch on the increase in operating costs shortly. In regards to copper, you see the clear impact of the reduced production from Batu Hijau, CAS more than doubling from the year-ago quarter. The Phase 6 stripping and processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue through the end of 2013. Moving to the waterfall chart on Slide 8. You'll see an 11% increase in operating costs on a per ounce basis made up of the following: Approximately $40 an ounce in lower volumes driven by the low-grade stockpile processing at Batu; lower mining in mill strip with the Tanami; lower ore grades at Ahafo. Approximately $26 an ounce in higher spending, largely due to high underground mining and backfill costs at Leeville in Nevada and at Tanami in Australia, a $4 million write-down of inventory at Tanami and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington. Gary will provide more color on the regional performance shortly. And finally, about $8 an ounce due to lower by-product credits. We do expect some of this to reverse in the fourth quarter as we delay the mining and processing of some high-grade copper ore at Phoenix and Nevada until we completed the floatation planned expansion. Turning to Slide 9. Financial results for the quarter included revenue of $2.5 billion; net income from continuing operations of $400 million, about $0.81 a share; adjusted net income of $426 million or $0.86 a share, some 33% lower than the prior year quarter; and cash flow from continuing operations of $578 million, slightly less than half the prior year quarter. I'll provide some additional color on the latter 2. Slide 10 provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted net income of $426 million for the quarter to the GAAP reported net income attributable to Newmont stockholders of $367 million. The loss from discontinued operations relates to a noncash mark-to-market increase on the accrual -- accrued royalty obligation related to St. Andrew's Goldfields, driven by a higher gold price assumption. The restructuring and other of $20 million represents the after-tax and minority interest share of severance-related costs, the majority of which were incurred again at Yanacocha in Peru. The expected 2012 savings related to the ongoing cost-reduction effort is now expected to be about $120 million, up from $120 million -- up from the $100 million, sorry, we communicated in July. Our focus is now on the cost-reduction efforts related to 2013 and beyond, which we will discuss with you during our year-end earnings call in February. The $142 million from the year-ago quarter was related to the noncash write-down of our investment in Paladin Resources, a uranium producer acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in the first half of 2011. And finally, on Slide 11, some more detail on quarterly operating cash flow. With the decrease mentioned previously largely attributable to increased tax payments with higher provisional payments in Australia accounting for the vast majority of this increase, along with a small increase in Peru, due to the recently enacted mining taxes that weren't payable in 2011. Lower gold and copper volumes, as previously discussed, increased operating costs as previously discussed, and finally, about $117 million in working capital increases spread evenly between accounts payable and inventory, which tend to be a timing issue. I'll now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the regional operating performance in more detail.
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, Russell, and good morning. Before we begin discussing the operating results for the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Allen Campbell, who was fatally injured at our Exodus underground mine in Nevada on August 31. Allen was 49 years old and had worked at Newmont for 24 years. Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife, Julie, and their 2 children, Levi and Jacob. We emphasize safety in everything we do at Newmont, at all of our operations every day. This was an unfortunate accident that we are learning from and we are taking the steps to help prevent similar events from happening again. Our goal at Newmont is to create a 0-harm workplace. We are not there yet, but remain committed to that goal every day. Now turning to Slide 12. As Richard mentioned, you'll see that the lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts were also reflected in our CAS, with the Australia Pacific region incurring the largest increase in CAS year-over-year as we spread higher Phase 6 stripping costs at Batu Hijau across a lower production base. Our third quarter gold production and CAS were also impacted by unplanned maintenance at Boddington and lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia. While our third quarter CAS of $693 per ounce was above the upper end of the 2012 outlook, our year-to-date CAS of $664 per ounce is within the revised range of $650 million to $675 per ounce. As Richard mentioned, we expect to end the year at the high end of that range. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect slightly higher production from North America and Asia Pacific to offset slightly lower production from South America and relatively flat production from Africa. As a result, we plan to end the year at the low end of our 2012 outlook of 5 million to 5.1 million ounces of production. I want to emphasize that this is not an effort to boost quarter 4 at the expense of early 2013 results. Rather, it reflects where we are today in the various mine plans. Turning to Slide 13. You'll see that our North American region continues to be a cornerstone for our company and a remarkable story of longevity, contributing approximately 41% of our production in the third quarter. The repairs that took place at the Leeville vent shaft in the second quarter had a slight impact to production and CAS in the third quarter as it took a little time to get caught up but at the end of the quarter, it was back at normal run rates. Q3 CAS also reflected some lower grades at Midas in Nevada, as well as at La Herradura in Mexico. We are pleased to announce that our Emigrant mine achieved commercial production in September. This new leach operation is expected to contribute between 80,000 and 90,000 ounces annually to North America's production. We've also been successful in reporting record throughput in Mill 6 for 3 consecutive months, achieving levels exceeding 10,500 tons per day. This was the result of a business excellence program where folks looked at alternatives to the grind of the ore feed that allowed them to increase throughput without sacrificing recovery. Our Nevada team deserves a lot of credit for this achievement and this is a good example of the benefits from combining the technical and business improvement talent on the opportunities in the business. We continue to have some good exploration and development outcomes in Nevada. For example, construction is on schedule at the Phoenix copper leach project and in October, work began on the first freeze ring as we prepare to sink our third vent shaft at Leeville. We're still receiving good news out of Long Canyon as the exploration team is reporting good drill results, and we continue to expect to declare first NRM when we report our year-end results next February. We are still evaluating various processing options as we continue to improve our knowledge of the ore body. Turning to our South America region on Slide 14. Q3 attributable production was 196,000 ounces, representing about 16% of our total for the quarter. Production results were higher than a year ago as higher mill throughput and leach pad recoveries partially offset lower leach placement. The higher production and recoveries favorably impacted CAS relative to the prior year quarter. As some of you may have read, as part of our cost-reduction efforts and to align our staffing levels with Yanacocha's mine plan, we recently engaged in a reduction in force of approximately 800 employees. We're consolidating several of our functions previously located in Lima to Cajamarca to support future development in the region. There are also some leadership changes under way in South America. Carlos Santa Cruz, who joined Newmont 20 years ago and has led our business in South America since 2001 has been appointed Senior Vice President for Australia Pacific region effective February 1, 2013. His experience and steady hand in leading our regional operations through a variety of complex business situations, political and social challenges has also earned him the respect of his employees and peers at Newmont. Carlos is transitioning to our APAC region as Jeff Huspeni, Senior Vice President in Asia Pacific, has announced that he will retire in March 2013 after 30 years with Newmont. Jeff has been an outstanding leader in the areas of safety, integrity and driving continuous improvement in our operations in both Asia Pacific and Africa. Todd White is being promoted to Senior Vice President, South America effective November 5. Todd will be based in Cajamarca with responsibility for our business in Yanacocha and developing strategy to support future development in the region. Todd has been with Newmont for 18 years, most recently leading our global business improvement efforts, and led our ESR and operations teams in Peru in the past. Javier Velarde, Associate General Counsel, has been appointed as the Interim General Manager for Corporate Affairs also effective November 5 and reporting to me. Javier will be based in Lima with the responsibility for strengthening relationships with the government and community stakeholders. Javier joined Newmont in 2001 and led our legal efforts in the region from 2001 to 2011. Javier's government relations capabilities and knowledge of Peru's complex political and social landscape will help build the support necessary for Newmont's future developments in the region. Both Todd and Javier will work closely together as we make the changes to reflect and support our evolving needs, while maintaining our strong commitment to operating safely, profitably and creating a foundation for future growth. Note that our full year outlook for Yanacocha remains unchanged. Thus, we still expect about 685,000 ounces of attributable gold production for 2012. This means that the fourth quarter production at Yanacocha will likely be closer to 100,000 ounces rather than the nearly 200,000-ounce run rate we've see in the first 3 quarters of the year, as this year's mine plan calls for less mill ore and more leach material in the fourth quarter. With respect to Conga, we are moving ahead with the "Water First" approach, constructing reservoirs before building production facilities or beginning mining. At the same time, we're making efforts to enhance our credibility in the urban and rural community in order to contribute to the improvement of social conditions necessary to move forward with the project. Moving to Slide 15. Our Asia Pacific region, which contributed about 32% of our production this quarter, was impacted by the previously mentioned lower tons mined at Tanami, lower grades at Batu as we process stockpiles and a longer-than-expected mill time at Boddington. Continued issues at Tanami are related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned higher-grade stopes. These issues are being partially mitigated through rescheduling mining into new mining areas and ramping up paced backfilling to higher levels. That is -- I talked about last quarter, these issues will take some time to address. While the team is working through the backfill issues, we have decided to defer further development work on the Tanami shaft project, as we focus on improving the execution and delivery at the existing operation and to better understand the impact of the near-surface, underground Auron discovery on the overall life of mine plan. This provides flexibility related to the timing of the shaft development. We expect to reassess the restart date of the Tanami shaft project in 2015. The unplanned mill downtime at Boddington was primarily due to conveyor pulley bearing failures with the primary feed conveyors, and this issue is being addressed. We acknowledge that Boddington will have to operate safely and without interruption this quarter to deliver on its revised production guidance of 725,000 to 750,000 ounces. That said, with the 72,000-ounce month in October, we are tracking in line with this guidance for the year. Batu Hijau production was impacted by processing lower-grade stockpile material, throughput and recovery due to delayed access of higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit due to an April high wall failure. The lower production rates at Batu Hijau were already reflected in our production outlook that was revised in Q2. APAC CAS was impacted by lower production levels I just discussed and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, as well as waste stripping costs at Batu Hijau. Just a quick update regarding the divestiture process at Batu Hijau. Our current economic interest is 48.5% and efforts continue to divest the final 7%. The fourth extension of the closing deadline was signed in October, extending the deadline now to January 31, 2013. Our effective economic interest will be 44.56% once the divestment is complete. We will keep you informed as we advance on this revised schedule. We also begin negotiations with the unions at Batu Hijau for a new collective labor bargaining agreement in November. This week, there was a 3-day illegal strike at Batu Hijau involving our haulage truck drivers. This action was not sanctioned by their union, and the employees returned to work on Thursday. Processing continued uninterrupted during this time. We've committed to continue our dialogue with this group's representatives regarding their concerns, and also like to thank our employees for remaining focused on performing their jobs safely over the last few days whilst this activity has been occurring at the mine. On Slide 16, we've summarized third quarter performance at Ahafo in Ghana, which contributed about 11% of our Q3 production. Ahafo's production of 131,000 ounces in the third quarter was down 10% from last year's quarter due to expected lower ore grade. The higher-grade Apensu pit, which contributed significantly to 2011 production, is now mined out, but we are seeing encouraging exploration results from Apensu South. Our full year production outlook for the region remains unchanged. CAS was $561 per ounce, up from a year ago due to the lower production, longer hauls and higher labor costs. Africa production is expected to grow over the next few years, primarily through the development of Akyem, which is progressing very well. With respect to the development of the Subika underground mine, we've slowed down the development schedule as we work to obtain the necessary permits and to optimize the overall Ahafo water balance and to most importantly, determine the most economic sequence for the development of the greater Ahafo district. Looking at Slide 17, the Akyem project is approximately 65% complete, tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013, followed by a 3- to 6-month ramp-up to full production. In terms of the progress made, 11 carbon and leach tank shells have been completed and are shown in the lower right picture. The tanks commenced water filling in early September for hydro testing, which has just recently been completed. The primary crusher is 85% complete, and we continue with the commissioning and testing of the water treatment plant. Akyem is really taking shape. The grinding mill shells, both sag and ball mill have both been erected, and you can see those in the upper right-hand picture, and the mine maintenance workshop is nearly complete. If you recall, we shared first mining pictures at Akyem with you back at the Denver Gold Show, and I'm happy to report mining continues at Akyem and is slightly ahead of schedule. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, Gary and Russell. Turning to the final slide, our operating team remains focused on the safety of our people, delivering operational performance within our 2012 outlook and on improving the efficiency of our mines. At the same time, we're continuing to optimize and refine our project development efforts and plans to ensure that we're building profitable mines that generate real returns and free cash flow. As Gary mentioned earlier, our Akyem project in Ghana is an excellent example of the kind of project execution and quality we're striving for throughout our portfolio. Akyem continues to progress well and is expected to be a cornerstone in our growing business presence in Ghana. We also remain focused on leading the industry in generating returns and returning capital back to where it belongs, with our shareholders, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Our leadership in these areas is a testament to the quality of our people, and I'd like to thank each one of them for their tireless commitment to our business. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Bridges.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm pleased to see you've got a new mine in Nevada. I just wondered if you could give us a very broad outline as to what to expect from Nevada. It remains very much a black box, and I just wanted to get a sense as to what sort of production level we could expect from there and for how long? I recognize it's a very broad brush thing, but if you could give us a bit of guidance, I would appreciate it.
Richard T. O'Brien: Maybe I'll ask Gary to start out and see if anybody else wants to add to that. Gary?
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, John. I think Nevada, as I said in the presentation, has been really the cornerstone for our business. We continue to make investments. We've got the development of the shaft at Leeville, which will allow us -- basically it's a ventilation shaft that allows us to extend access into different parts of the ore body and to slightly increase production over time. We're making the investment in the Phoenix copper leach. And then I mentioned also, Long Canyon and the future that, that represents. That's out a bit in time as we've presented in the past in different meetings, but still see Nevada as a major part of our overall portfolio going forward.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: At current -- holding current production levels or improving?
Gary J. Goldberg: I see, at this stage and we'll run through details, obviously, early next year as we look at outlook for '13 and then talk further beyond that. But in the 1.5 million to 2 million ounce range going forward out through 2020.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And there's a lot of difference in the way that cash costs are reported throughout the industry at the moment. Because you guys don't use, aren't allowed to use deferred stripping but a lot of your competition are. I just wondered how your costs would compare if you were on an apples-to-apples basis.
Richard T. O'Brien: Russell, do you want to take that one?
Russell D. Ball: Yes, sure, Richard. John, it's an interesting question, and when we -- we do tend to look at, you're right, we can't adopt IFRS and that makes, I guess, us and Freeport a little different to some of our peers in the business. We do look at it, and it depends where you are in the mine, so it's very difficult to put one number. But think somewhere around $30 to $50 an ounce from a CAS perspective. And if we just look at Batu Hijau for this quarter, we would've seen about a $140 million to $150 million increase in operating cash flow. That would have obviously been offset against higher capital as we move it over from the income statement essentially to the -- or from working capital, up into capital. So at the end of the day, there is no free lunch and the accounting does create some noise, certainly from an income statement perspective and that's why we or at least I tend to focus a little bit more maybe on the cash flow than the income statement. But at the end of the day, it's in the total costs of production. And as we talked about with you all in May, the focus for us is really on total cost of production. So whether it shows up in CAS or deferred stripping or sustaining capital, it gets in the total cost of production. So you're right, there is some noise on an income statement. Think about it as $30 to $50 an ounce higher than where we would be under an IFRS environment. But that does move depending on the type of ore bodies here and obviously, a bigger issue for open pits. So yes, $30 and $50 and for this quarter at Batu Hijau alone, $140-odd million have ended up higher operating cash flow under that reporting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: My question is for Richard and just how should we kind of conceptualize the big spending buckets that you have in your control for 2013, namely, maintenance CapEx. We've already heard some of your competitors talk about paring back the maintenance a little bit. So if you could talk about that. Do you feel that your maintenance capital could come down? Your growth CapEx, broad brush, could you give us an idea of what you're generally expecting for 2013? And then your exploration expense has grown quite a bit in the past few years and I'm wondering if in this environment where you're managing more for cash flow, is exploration a bit more of a discretionary expense right now?
Richard T. O'Brien: What I would say is a couple things. First, we are, as Russell has already said and as we said in our May Investor Day, we are managing towards total cost. We've already announced, Jorge, that we're going to take this year alone, out of our exploration budget, probably $30 million. I think taking that for really, half a year and thinking about next year, I think you could anticipate a further reduction in exploration spending. But as I said, Grigore is our exploration head. He's really focused on continuing to offset depletion through additional discoveries near mine and then looking still long term for other development properties through greenfield. So we're still going to be in the exploration business, but we're going to be able to do it with less money. In particular, eliminating some of our higher cost opportunities, both higher cost for exploration, as well as higher total cost. So I would say we will see a cutback in exploration in 2013 and probably in the order of $50 million to $75 million just depending on where we end up with the cash flow estimates for the entire business. On sustaining capital, I can put that one over to Gary and Randy in a minute, but it is something that we actually started focusing on about 2 years ago, when we saw a significant increase in our own estimates of sustaining capital in our business plan. And I can tell you each one of our regions is focused on their sustaining capital and on bringing it down. So this year, for example, our sustaining capital has been probably in the order of $250 or $225 an ounce just depending on where you are in the portfolio. With that, we continue to look at the balance for next year between wanting to sustain the productive capacity but also focusing more on returns. I would say there's going to be the capability to reduce sustaining capital some next year but I know Gary is really trying to tear into this, and I would say when we get to 2013 numbers, Gary will have more detail for you on those areas where we are spending sustaining capital that we feel can be cut in the next few years and where we're going to continue to reinvest in the business. On development capital, obviously, when we talk about our gold-linked dividend and in 2011 Investor Day, we talked about 2 years, 2012 and '13, which were going to be cash flow negative, as Russell talked about upfront, and a large piece of that was related to develop to capital to actually, develop new business. And for this year, for example, we probably will look at development capital of probably $300 million to $500 million less than where we started the year. And that's really coming from the reductions at Conga, as well as some reductions at Tanami, as Gary mentioned. Tanami now being slipped out 'til 2015 for a re-evaluation, Conga being further reduced. We're actually, as Russ said, going to be substantially more free cash flow generating than we thought. I think the same is going to happen in 2014, while we continue to look at the portfolio. So while I can't give you precise numbers for '13 and '14, what I can tell you is, I think, less exploration, less overhead, less in advanced projects, as we are able to move projects along, I think, with less overhead, as well as cutting those projects that don't make sense and I think sustaining and development capital are going through a continued, focused reductions, while at the same time, allowing us to invest. So we are going to finish Akyem next year. It will come into commercial production. I think Ghana does represent a great place for us to invest additional capital and we will expand our opportunities there. And then as we mentioned in Suriname and other places where we have opportunities, we will put capital to work. So we're not afraid to put capital to work. We just want to make sure it has the right returns. I don't know, Gary or Randy, do you want to add to that on sustaining capital or any other area?
Gary J. Goldberg: No, I think, Richard, you've covered the overall picture quite well. I think the focus that we're taking out in the operations is to look at total cost, a little bit what Russell said before and re-emphasize the points that we made from our May Investor Day. It's not just looking at CAS or looking at sustaining capital, you've got to look at the whole picture and you got to look at getting effective and efficient returns from that capital. So we're going through that process in detail with each of the regions going through what their plans are, understanding what's in there. There is an -- you can make some cuts today and that will hurt you tomorrow if you don't make sure you do the right investments. So I think it's important, I mean, not just randomly cut, that we go through in detail in the process that we're going through to make sure we're making the right investments.
Operator: Next question comes from David Haughton with BMO.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Having a look at your guidance for this year, very strong quarter required here. I know that Gary gave some indications that at least at Boddington, October is looking very good, but still quite a big requirement off Nevada. Can you just explain why you're confident of meeting that strong fourth quarter?
Richard T. O'Brien: Gary?
Gary J. Goldberg: Sure thing. The team and I have been through this with Tom Kerr and the team as they put their plans together. Some of it is related to grade and timing of when the grade is and some of the throughput. I mentioned the additional throughput that we're getting, the business excellence program that, that's delivered, and that's looking very sustainable. So while they know it's a stretch, they also are committed to achieving those targets. And they've explained to me where they see that they can achieve that.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Just specifically on where that throughput would be. Are we talking here about roaster throughput or heap leach, or can you just give us a little bit more of an idea where?
Gary J. Goldberg: It's really out of both. I could -- without going into all the specifics of the plant sites, I think Russell mentioned even some of the higher-grade ores that we held back at Phoenix that will be coming through as we've got that copper circuit online there. So it's really in all the places. Midas would be probably the one place we'd probably see a little bit of a downturn, but in the overall scheme of things, it's not a large contributor.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And Emigrant coming online, is that going to be an incremental 80,000 to 90,000 ounces to the heap leach?
Gary J. Goldberg: That's correct. As we -- and that will be in 2013.
Russell D. Ball: So Dave, it's Russ. If you think about it, we still had some of the spillover impact from the vent shaft repairs this quarter and we just had the Emigrant go into commercial production at the end of August, if memory serves. So you're going to see that run out. And as I mentioned, we do see some good grades sitting ahead of the crusher at Phoenix. So Nevada has historically delivered on their portfolio and we have no reason to believe that the numbers we put in front of you are not going to deliver on this quarter.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. And just going to Boddington, you gave us an idea that October looked pretty good at over 70,000 ounces. Are you suggesting that we should be thinking 200,000 ounces plus out of Boddington for fourth quarter?
Gary J. Goldberg: Yes, that's what we're targeting, and that's a combination, sustained mill throughput, obviously, through the quarter. But we're seeing higher grades as we expected to come into higher grades here in the fourth quarter. So both of those will contribute to achieving that.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. And also Gary, on your run through, you spoke about the sell-down of that last tranche I think it is of Batu. Can you just explain what's the next step there?
Russell D. Ball: Dave, it's Russell. Maybe I'll take that one. We have been in negotiations for a protracted time on the 7% with an agency of the government. We have a price agreed, I think $245 million-odd. We continue to work through that. I don't see that closing anytime soon for a number of reasons. So I suspect we will be at the 48.5% for most of 2013, quite frankly. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the government of Indonesia, but there hasn't been a lot of progress. And as you've seen, we've extended it for the fourth time, if memory serves, and I suspect there'll be a fifth.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. So you're the willing seller, but you haven't got a willing buyer yet? Or a capable buyer?
Russell D. Ball: That may be an oversimplification, but we haven't been able to conclude the transaction, yes, Dave.
Richard T. O'Brien: I would just add to that, we had a constitutional court case where the Minister of Finance who was trying to secure the right through, as Russell mentioned, a government agency under the finance group to buy this for the central government. And that constitutional case went against the Minister of Finance and the President, suggesting that he needed to get approval from Parliament to allow that purchase. So we were waiting patiently for that constitutional court to take place. It did. And now, the Minister of Finance and his team have asked for an extension to consider their next steps, which could include seeking approval from Parliament or some other agency making the purchase or some other way. And as Russ said, we're just going to continue to work through it.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Just last question, if I may. Subika underground, you mentioned that there might be some timing delays there. Can you just explain what the situation is and when do you think it may come online?
Gary J. Goldberg: Sure thing. I'll take that one, David. Subika underground, we had a couple things there. One is making sure we get the appropriate exploration permits. That hasn't been an issue, we've got those permits now, but also understanding the water balance. And as we develop an underground mine that draws down more of the water resource and just understanding completely what the effects are in the region and how we're going to process and handle that water is a critical piece in this stage. So those are some things we're working on. More importantly though is how does it fit into the overall regional expansion. We've got the Ahafo 2x plus mill expansion. Basically putting in an additional 1 or 2 sag mills. We're still going through accessing what's the right sequence to bring that on. But that looks to be like the next most attractive way of expanding our production at Ahafo. So it's really making sure we've got the right sequence. The other piece, and I didn't really talk about it, is how Ahafo North fits into that and whether we fit that in and process it through our existing mill facilities or the facilities there at Ahafo or whether we develop facilities right near the deposit at Ahafo North. So a lot of options that we're looking at, we want to make sure that we've really gone through, done the exercise and work to bring it forward. And then when is the right time to bring Subika underground in? Clearly, higher grade but also higher cost when you go underground. So we want to make sure we get the balance right as we bring that into the portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Gallo [ph] with Calvert Investment.
Unknown Analyst: I have a quick regulatory question. And it's about the tax and royalty payment disclosure part of the Dodd-Frank law. I think, Russell, when the law was originally passed, you mentioned that Newmont had welcomed it and felt like the costs were pretty de minimis. And this past week, or actually, I think it was a couple weeks ago, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce filed a challenge to the law. And I'm curious to -- I'm wondering if Newmont supports that challenge or do you still sort of see the implementation of this as pretty easy?
Richard T. O'Brien: Let me take that and Russ, you can jump in. So Newmont has been and will continue to be responsive to EITI, as well as the GRI. So we are a company which already reports our royalties and taxes. And so we just didn't have a big issue with this one. And I don't know, I can't speak for those people that do, but we are committed to being fully transparent in disclosing our tax and royalty payments to governments around the world, something that we've done without the insistence of Dodd-Frank and something we'll continue to do. Russ, you want to add?
Russell D. Ball: Yes. The suit -- and we're not a party to the suit. I've read some of the documentation around it. We aren't caught up in some of the more onerous provisions that this group is objecting to. We have a small, very small part of our business that is impacted by that regulation or requirements and we feel, to the discussion we had the last time this issue came up, it's really a de minimis requirement for us. We intend to comply. It's not a big onerous requirement and we will be reporting, as Richard said, based on the new regulations, which come into effect, I think, for the year ended '13.
Operator: Our next question from Adam Graf with Dahlman Rose.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: I guess, an overarching question maybe for Russell is on a global basis, what are you guys seeing on a forward-looking for capital and labor costs, especially in Australia, given the falloff in the coal market there and potentially the availability for additional labor or pressure on labor costs?
Russell D. Ball: Yes, Adam, I'll take a stab at that. Clearly, we've seen a pullback there and I think, Western Australia, in particularly, was probably the hardest region around the world so they have maybe, the most opportunity to come back to where the rest of the field is. We have not seen this slowdown impact, for example, commodity spend yet. And I say yet and there is a big question mark, whether it's on China or on Europe, what the global macro picture is going to be. But our biggest commodity cost outside of labor is diesel fuel. We'll spend about $700 million a year on diesel and you can see that picture pretty readily. The labor component for us is around 50%, depending on which region you're in. And I'll say that the pressure is still upward, and maybe at slightly lower rates than we have seen over the last 4, 5 years. I don't believe that you'll see labor rates stay flat or come down, quite frankly, in this environment. So I think our planning assumption across the portfolio is around 5% to 7%. That will give you an indication of how we think about that labor cost pressure, certainly less than it was 1 year or 2 years ago, but still challenged in a number of regions where we operate.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And are you guys -- what would you estimate the labor inflation rate is that you guys are seeing in Nevada?
Russell D. Ball: Nevada is actually one of the more benign locations, and I think that's a function of the U.S. economy in general and the particular situation in Nevada, but somewhere around 3% to 4%.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And then on the capital cost side, are you seeing any stabilization there from major equipment?
Russell D. Ball: We just had some discussions with some of our larger vendors and I'll say their perspective is still in the 5% to 10% range.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: On a global basis, would you say that's pretty consistent?
Russell D. Ball: It varies certainly by region but for the portfolio, somewhere between 5% and 10%. Again, you have to get into some of the details around which pieces of equipment. You're talking about tires, for example, so we're seeing a lot of pressure through the price of rubber. Cyanide, another example where it's a derivative of the ag industry. So when corn prices are up, we tend to pay more for some of those inputs. So you really have to dig into the granularity, but 5% to 7% is a reasonable number.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And then if you don't mind, maybe some more specific questions. I noticed on Yanacocha, in the third quarter, the tonnage for leach ore was sharply down. Was that -- what was behind that? And I apologize if I missed the answer before.
Gary J. Goldberg: That's fine, Adam. It's just really more a matter of timing. We had more mill ore and less leach ore during the quarter and we're going to see that reverse here in the fourth quarter.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And then maybe again, a question for Russell is, I know there's this carbon tax in Australia that seems to have kicked in for everybody. Can maybe you guys tell us a bit more about that?
Russell D. Ball: Yes. And if you look at our operations in Australia, the biggest impact of that is felt at Boddington, just given the nature of some of the smaller underground mines. Somewhere around $40 an ounce increase in CAS for this year as a result of that carbon tax. So we do feel it, like the other competitors in Australia. Boddington is really the 800-pound gorilla from our perspective when you look at our assets down there, somewhere around $40 an ounce at current pricing.
Adam P. Graf - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And that's something that's just going to stay flat on a per ounce basis?
Gary J. Goldberg: It basically stays flat, Adam, through the next 3 years. There's some other mechanisms that kick in. We also have to keep an eye on what happens with the Australian political situation because the opposition party there has a different view on that. So that's another one to keep an eye on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions. First on Suriname, any thoughts on how your discussions with the government are progressing? What's been the focus recently?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, I would say discussions with the government are progressing and the focus is continuing to be on trying to finalize the terms and conditions around the mineral agreement and the amount of property that goes -- that, that mineral agreement covers. And I would say that the discussions are proceeding. That's really where we are right now.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. Is there any chance that those may finalize by fourth quarter?
Richard T. O'Brien: We'll have to see. I think that the government is focused on this, as are we. But as you can imagine, there's any number of things that the government has to face in their daily lives as do we, so we'll just see how it goes and how terms and conditions work out.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Sounds good. Then on Long Canyon, what are your most recent thoughts on the scale of the project? Is 200,000 to 300,000 ounces per year still sound like the right target?
Richard T. O'Brien: Gary, do you want to take that?
Gary J. Goldberg: Sure thing, Richard. Yes, we're looking at a variety of options both mill and leach, as we start the project up. As I said, the drilling continues to confirm what we expected there for potential for the ore body but still more drilling to go through. And current estimates have us in the 200,000 to 300,000 ounce per year range in the first 5 years of production.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And one final question on Yanacocha. You talked about fourth quarter. Any thoughts on next year or how production and cost may look like?
Gary J. Goldberg: We'll give more detail early next year when we give the guidance but part of the reduction in force that we went through is really resetting and looking at levelizing the production out for the next 3 to 4 years if you look at what the remaining reserve is at Yanacocha. So we'll get into the details on that when we give guidance early next year.
John Seaberg: Richard, any closing comments?
Richard T. O'Brien: I'd just like to thank everyone for attending today, and your continued and ongoing interest in Newmont, and we look forward to talking to you after the fourth quarter. So thanks, everyone, for attending, and thanks to the team for delivering.
John Seaberg: With that, we can end the call, operator. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont Mining's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer; Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Operating officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive leadership team. Turning to Slide 2. Before we discuss the quarterly results, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks, as further described on our -- in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, John. Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to recruit Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business, opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. As a reminder, today Gary is responsible for worldwide operations; projects of safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation; and business excellence. Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry-leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary, some at our recent Investor Day, and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better. This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise, as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa. I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country. Now turning to Slide 3. As we talked about in May at our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirmed our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price-linked dividend. Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year. As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 to 5.1 million ounces, while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We've also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga in Peru. We expect our advanced projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012, primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru, as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A: so $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A. We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advanced projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations. We also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%. Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advance-stage development opportunities, such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years, depending on future events in Peru as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress and evaluation of our earlier-stage projects, including Subika, the Ahafo Mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon, as well as various regional expansion opportunities. Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans, but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment, while at the same time working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe environmentally and socially acceptable manner. In support of this effort for 2012 and 2013, we have, as we've communicated previously, revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012 we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities. Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the government of Peru and the local communities, as well as with the regional government, through the mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government, with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President Humala's social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part. As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results.
Russell D. Ball: Thanks, Richard. Good day, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled roster maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception. Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective, we're on budget for the first 6 months and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown in Conga. Reading the sales coverage this morning provided some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely, and I quote, "Earnings missed not as bad as it looks," as did John Bridges at JPMorgan: "Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm." I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results. Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget although significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously, you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore, currently scheduled for early 2014. Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely in line with budget, but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes stepping you through 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3/4 of that shortfall. We incurred approximately $52 million in care and maintenance costs at Hope Bay as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer at the year end, but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we were not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance costs, so we have to expense these as incurred, going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian-sourced income, we also have to raise the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, so pre- and post-tax numbers on Hope Bay are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share. Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure costs at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013. We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrates that resulted in an inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward, to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be significant, are more visible and less of a surprise when we report earnings. Operating costs for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at $681 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 delta above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of $625 to $675 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at the Tanami. I suspect we will end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range for we still have 2 quarters to go. $18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper provisional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year. So clearly, a lot of noise this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days. Slide 7. As noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold costs applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted costs in Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi, offset by a strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will spend some time covering the operating results in more detail, shortly. Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price-linked dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked the dividend to our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment and refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustments on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend, although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval. Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, Russell, and good morning. Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call. I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth and sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations and what I have seen only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people. From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. Newmont's gold price-linked dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic directions, and we are all focused on executing the plan in driving value for our shareholders. To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges, including rising total costs and increasing political and social pressures, we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth. As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have our regional operating teams and corporate teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned. And we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013. I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come. And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Trio underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand, which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi. Turning to Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts are reflected in our costs, with Asia Pacific incurring the largest increase in costs as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance costs at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi, across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance. Turning to Slide 11. In North America, we had a good quarter relative to last year, looking at production. That said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada's lowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April -- late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete and operations are back on track. We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, "Engaging the public early will help us to ensure our high standards meet community expectations." We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon. Turning to our South America region, on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we processed higher-grade material and achieved higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance. Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address. Shaft development is progressing, albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly. Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhauls -- overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement, as well as the related downtime. Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the central government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012. On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production and a higher direct mining costs. The Akyem project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013. I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, Gary. As we've said for a number of years, execution matters. We must do what we say we will do, and for 2012 that means deliver on our 2012 plans. We're halfway through 2012 and we're well positioned to do just that: deliver on our plans for 2012. For the future, we remain focused on delivering profitable growth, realizing exploration potential and ensuring competitive project returns on capital. Recognizing that, when things change with respect to potential social, political and other risks, we will incorporate those changes and risks into our project claims and returns and ensure that our projects continue to remain viable. We don't believe that growth in any cost is a winning strategy. We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, which affords us the flexibility to be selective on the projects we develop, while continuing to reward our shareholders with one of the best dividends in the industry. We will maintain that strong balance sheet. And finally, we're focused on reducing our total costs, not just operating costs and not just capital costs, but all of our costs right through the portfolio, from the exploration stage all the way through closure. And we'll do so while ensuring we maintain focus on delivering longer-term value in accordance with the strategy we discussed with you at Investor Day. Thank you for listening into our call. And operator, we'll now open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question’s from John Bridges, JPMC.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: John Bridges. So I was just wondering -- a lot of the adjustments that are, of course, perfectly normal seem to have gone negative this quarter. I just wondered if there's not a better way of giving us some guidance so we don't get the negative surprises.
Russell D. Ball: John, it's Russ. A fair comment, and you're right, this quarter they did negative. Clearly, with us releasing production and sales numbers we’ll be able to address the inventory issue upfront. We do have a lot going on in the portfolio. And you're right, this quarter, most did go against us. I’ll work with John's group in particular and we'll figure out a mechanism how we can, if there are events that -- Hope Bay may be the best example in this quarter. I think most people had assumed, and maybe that's shame on me, that the accrual at the end of the year took care of Hope Bay going forward. Unfortunately, we can't accrue for those costs, and that's why on the call I tried to provide some perspective on it going forward, so I take your point. And John and I will sit down and figure out what we need to do, obviously bearing in mind we got regulatory issues we will just need to work through. But your comment’s valid and we certainly take it on-board.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, it’s a shame when Gary's mines are ticking along quite nicely to have a result, which looks -- which is giving the wrong impression. And then, Gary, I wondered if -- we had a nice chat at Investor Day. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the potential you see to work on costs. I suppose you will need a new truck at Waihi. But I just wondered what -- if you can give us some guidance on where you see costs going.
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, John. I appreciate it. Yes, of course, the new truck at Waihi. But when you look across the portfolio, and as Richard and Russell also mentioned, we've got a process going on where we're taking a look at really the whole portfolio: looking at our operating costs, looking at our sustaining capital, looking at our project execution costs, and ultimately you’ve got to go right back to the mine plans and the details that sit behind that. So making sure I bring maybe a little bit different background coming from base metals and some different things, that we are putting the rigor around some of the planning processes and the reconciliation processes to make sure that we're able to deliver what we say we're going to deliver, that we fully understand the variability around that and that, and that, that shows up into our plans. The teams definitely have done a great job over the years of delivering against targets, when you look at our performance, but want to continue to do that, but also make sure we've got a good eye towards costs. So we'll be in a position later this year, as we pull together our 2013 plans, to deliver that information in terms of the details around guidance for the plan for 2013 and going forward. So there's opportunities there clearly that I'm focused on, and I look forward to sharing with those -- those with you in the future.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: In terms of time frame, you've given maintained guidance for costs, which maybe that's an element of efforts that you're putting in already. But are we talking about benefits that can come through next year or in a 3-year time frame? What sort of time frame do you see?
Russell D. Ball: So John, it's Russ. Maybe I can just add a little to Gary's commentary. As Richard spoke to in the analyst conference, we all focused on total cost of ownership. We have engaged an outside group to come in and challenge us, and we're working through that process right now. We gave you a little bit of an indication around 2012. We're still in the middle of the budget process for 2013, but it's fair to say, across the entire organization, folks are involved and focused on eliminating total cost. It's too early to give you numbers. We have to work through the steps internally and then with our board, but we will make this public when we announce not only '13 numbers but some indication of the 2014 and beyond run rate, because I think the run rate's probably the most important thing. We've all been involved with cost reduction exercises that take cost out, but they manage to somehow find them -- their way back into the organization. And the key for us is putting in place the process and the reporting and the mechanism to ensure that the cost we take out stay out, quite frankly. So that's where we're focused a little bit in the short term but significant opportunity above that, both on the capital and operating cost side, as we look at our first look at 2013. So towards the end of the year, John, we will, as Gary said, share that with you.
Richard T. O'Brien: And John, it's Richard. As I said on the call and I maintain, the management team here is focused on more efficient delivery of the same strategy that we've talked about. So we're still focused on developing our exploration potential right on through into the portfolio, executing our projects more efficiently and more effectively and delivering on our operations more effectively and more efficiently. So I look at this as continued refinement of the strategy that we have but delivering it better and more efficiently. And I know Gary's going to be a great partner in helping that to happen.
Operator: Our next question from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: My -- Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. My question is, I guess, for Richard. Just noticed the strong uptick in the net debt position in the second quarter. You're up about 70% year-on-year to over $4 billion. And I was wondering how we should think about your CapEx prioritization going forward given that, if we do get a change in the gold price because of your dividend policy, we could start to see roughly 1/2 of the incremental change in the gold price be paid out in dividends, and so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash cost. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is. And then, if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense and if you could give us an idea of maybe rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013. Do you think 2012 is really a lumpy year in terms of CapEx and things will smooth off going forward?
Richard T. O'Brien: Okay, so obviously a multipart question there, so let me take part of it. So how sacrosanct is the dividend? Look, we set the dividend policy. And we've been very clear about this since we set it: We set the dividend policy in ways that we think are sustainable over the longer term. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a policy, it would just be a moment. And so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does in fact enforce, and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember, when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been, I think, clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 to 7 million ounce delivery in 2017, with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years -- sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that. Although, with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year, less after-tax. So Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending, and we will. And we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet.
Russell D. Ball: Yes, Jorge, Russ. We obviously look at that. I will say that our net debt position is ahead of what we had budgeted. We're very comfortable with it. We've spent a fair amount of time with a rating agency discussing that capital profile and the lumpiness thereof. We've also -- as we look at the balance sheet, we have $1 billion-plus in short-term marketable securities that we have been very clear about with the market we consider as cash. So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again, part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation. And you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company of this size is appropriate and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off. We've said all along investment grade rating is a key fundamental of the company and we intend to preserve it. So you should look for us to balance, as Richard said, our desire to return capital to shareholders with the long-term financial strength of the balance sheet.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, such a great point about the extra cash and marketable securities. Is there any kind of metric for your investment grade rating in terms of net debt to EBITDA or debt to EBITDA that we should keep in mind?
Russell D. Ball: Yes. We look at all the usual metrics, and you've hit on 2 of them. We look forward-looking versus some of the agencies which are obviously looking at more backward-looking information, but we continue to evaluate all of those. In light of the fact that we are an unhedged company, we will have a conservative balance sheet because we do take more financial risks to metal prices, being unhedged.
Operator: Our next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Market.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Just on the topic of the build-up of inventory and timing of sales. Can you see that unwinding for the balance of the year? Or should we be thinking about this as a reasonable level to carry forward?
Russell D. Ball: Yes, David, Russ. We added about 240 million to the quarter to stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Some of the issues with the ore on leach pads is we're building higher pads and it's taking longer to get the ore out. In Nevada and at Boddington and Batu, we continue to -- not Batu, at Boddington we continue to build stockpiles as we look at optimizing cash flow, ounce productions and NAV. It was a little higher this quarter. I haven't looked at the detail around that for the rest of the year but we will -- we did also have included in that number the increase in finished goods inventory, the 40,000 ounces and the 9 million pounds, so that's obviously out the door subsequent to that quarter end. So yes, a little higher this quarter, around numbers about 100 million.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. Well, also, that build-up of inventory on the pads, as you described, together with the delays in recording the sales on the shipping of inventory would also help from improving your working cap position going into the balance of year too, I would expect.
Russell D. Ball: Correct. And also, just an observation on working capital: Q2, we tend to pay more taxes than the other quarters. So the tax run rate tends to pop up and in this quarter it was about $150 million higher than -- if you take the annual and divide by 4, we just have a number of payments due in the second quarter. So you're seeing that in the working capital and operating cash flow.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Just back to Batu. There had been a comment there that the sell-down of the last stench (sic) [tranche] might be imminent. Can you remind the -- us of the pricing of that last stench?
Richard T. O'Brien: The last tranche...
Russell D. Ball: David, it's Russ. I -- if memory serves, it was 2 49 [ph], but we'll get back to you. It's been so long. And there are some dividend adjustments related to the drop, I guess, sale and purchase agreements. So I'll get John to send you that. But if memory serves, it was 2 49 [ph], less dividends, from when we signed that agreement. And roughly 1/2 of that would come to us.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And is there any implication on your ability to consolidate Batu Hijau going forward compared to simply equity accounting with the dilution of your equity stake?
Russell D. Ball: No, David. Due to the accounting provisions around these variable interest entities, the VIEs, we share a disproportionate amount and we have the ability to control it. So we see at least for the foreseeable future that we will continue to consolidate that. If and when we think that may change, we’ll certainly give you a heads-up as soon as we know.
Richard T. O'Brien: And just to be clear, David, what we said is that there would be a readout of the decision from the Constitutional Court about the 7% and the central government's authority to buy that 7%. What we didn't say is that that's going to lead to an immediate closing. We don't know what the outcome's going to be. We just know that there's going to be a reading, because that was announced publicly. So when that happens, we'll inform you all as to what that means, so look for that in the coming weeks.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Is there a possibility that you'd end up with a vendo financing of it so that's -- you don't actually get the cash?
Richard T. O'Brien: That's not the intent of the current purchase and sale agreement.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. Last question. Finished copper, it sounds like you're making some good progress there. I just find that the way that your numbers are reporting Phoenix, although a separate entity in milling, is completely lost within the broader Nevada. Would you be separating those numbers out to give us a little bit more clarity about how that copper is progressing in the success or otherwise of the leach program?
Russell D. Ball: Dave, Russ. I'll add -- or I'll start and I'll ask Gary to add. It's a good question, it's one that Gary has asked since he's been here. As you know, historically we've reported Nevada as one unit as that's how we manage it. We are looking, as we drill down into costs, to getting a better understanding of the costs at each location. And we'll come back to you. I hear your point and I take it. Phoenix certainly has and continues to do very nicely relative to where it was historically. But I understand your issue and your desire to understand on a more asset specific. I'll ask Gary to give you his perspective, because at the end of the day, he owns these assets.
Gary J. Goldberg: No, thanks, Russ, and thanks, David. I think the key is we do have the information internally. It doesn't get reported externally in a way that you've just asked for, and we'll take a look at what we might be able to do it. But we do have the information, I see the details on how that and each part of the operation in Nevada is going. So we'll take a look at what we might do, especially as we get the copper leach on as well, to give you a little bit more information.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question, Patrick Chidley, HSBC.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Everybody, just coming back to the free cash flow aspects of the quarter. Can you break down the $412 million of net change in operating assets and liabilities just a -- I take it that would include the $240 million that you just mentioned.
Russell D. Ball: Yes. Patrick, it's Russ. I think there's detail in Note 23, if memory serves, on the 10-Q, which went in last night. It's on Page 29.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Okay. But basically, that stockpile and leach pad inventory bill -- is that the kind of rate that you'd expect long term as well? Or is this a special quarter?
Russell D. Ball: No, no. This is a -- and like I said, the second quarter had a little higher build to it than what we had anticipated. And included in that number that you see on that Note 29, the $443 million, is those -- or are those 40,000 ounces and 9 million pounds. So I'd say it's just a timing issue.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: And then the higher taxes.
Russell D. Ball: Yes, higher taxes, and you see that in the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities coming down, $227 million. Ignore the EGR refinery liabilities, the $406 million, that's noise.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: And then just also in terms of generating cash flow from the business, it seems if -- we saw Barrick yesterday. A lot of the bigger gold mining companies in particular are basically trying to prevent themselves from investing in lower-return projects and therefore shelving a lot of projects. And unfortunately, that comes with a lot of costs, such as we're seeing with Hope Bay this quarter. And I'm wondering if it's not better just to find an appropriate buyer for those assets and just get them out the door and then save the cash flow, because I can see that going on for quite some time at some of these things, Conga, Hope Bay, where you've got significant outgoings and not much coming in and a lot of delays, at the best-est case.
Randy Engel: Yes, Patrick, it's Randy. We have -- indeed, there are potential assets that we would love to divest if they don't meet our criteria and if there's a reasonable buyer out there.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Because, I mean, I just think there's -- a lot of people in the market, a lot of investors, they just look at your free cash flow numbers and a lot of the cash flow or significant chunks of the cash flow are going to projects that you don't necessarily think are the highest-return projects, let's put it that way.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, I think, Patrick, we're pretty careful to make sure that we are investing our capital in those projects which are the highest return. And you'll note that we're not calling what we're spending at Hope Bay, even capital. We know it's an expense. We know we have to shut that mine down in -- or that exploration property down in a way which is sustainable. That was our commitment when we took the license on. That will not go on forever. And with respect to Conga, I think we've been very clear that, that project must have an economic return or we won't go forward, but it also has to have the support of the community. And we can't make that happen overnight. So I think it's a balance between spending the right amount of money in the right way to keep the option open, but not spending so much that we are not managing the project closely, something that I know Gary and his team do every day to make sure we're trying to make sure that we're as efficient as possible. But I take the point, as Randy said, just because we'd like to sell it doesn't mean somebody else wants to buy it, particularly at a price that we think or -- that we think is acceptable or one that would allow somebody to take on the obligations that we have in a way which we think is responsible. We've got to do both of those.
Randy Engel: And Patrick, I think we just re-implied, reinforced what Richard said earlier, which is, obviously what we're trying to do is make sure that we take a hard look at those projects that are marginal, but at the same time develop those projects that provide investors with upside gold price exposure and some free cash flow.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Right, right. And then just a final question, just a broad-brush question on how you think the landscape is right now in terms of building projects, new projects, with seemingly ever-increasing capital expenditures versus just going and buying competitors.
Richard T. O'Brien: No, I -- thanks, Patrick. Obviously, you've got to look at both the challenges that we face on the project execution side are no different than our competitors' face with labor cost issues in certain parts of the world. You look to the short to medium term, maybe some parts of the commodities world backing off might be an opportunity in there. And we are looking through that as part of our costs where you looking at all the cost for executing on our projects. And we've got to make sure we build that into our look forward and our opportunities as well. But, I agree, we're no -- we're not immune to the same things our competitors are seeing in some of the costs.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Right. But in terms of buying a competitor with a gold mine that's producing that you can actually buy the whole thing for less than building your own project, I mean, there must be opportunities like that, surely.
Randy Engel: As far as the producing targets go, Patrick, I think, once you've put on some sort of change in control premium, it gets pretty tight-defined targets that are better and cheaper than building them...
Richard T. O'Brien: But again, we look at efficient utilization of capital, and Randy's rating-and-ranking portfolio of external opportunities sits right next to Gary's rating and ranking of internal properties. And we do try to balance that and to the extent that -- it was Randy who says we can find something in the market that actually adds to our portfolio, both with respect to sustainability and return. I think that's something that we would take a look at, but it's got to have the same kind of return. We don't want to dilute shareholders or delude them by issuing a bunch of shares to buy something that might bring that same exact issues that we see that somebody else is having with development of their properties or running of their properties. So yes, I think it's always an opportunity we evaluate. It's a trade-off and it's one that we watch, again, pretty much every day.
Randy Engel: Yes. And there are a handful of targets that we've got prioritized, but again, you just -- you've got to wait for the right opportunity and you've got to weight that up against everything else you have inside.
Operator: Our next question from Brian MacArthur, UBS.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I was wondering if you can just give me some guidance going forward on Yanacocha as it looks like, as you’ve talked about, Conga may get pushed out. And you do have a good guidance in your chart, taking down production from 700,000 ounces in South America to 400, but can you -- or to -- can you just give me some guidance on what the cost structure would look like that goes along with that? If we don't get Conga going forward, as Yanacocha runs down over the next 3 or 4 years, what sort of the cost structure would look like vis-a-vis today?
Gary J. Goldberg: Brian, I'll go ahead and start, and then maybe Russ can add to that. We've got Carlos and the team down there taking a look. With obviously Conga rescheduled and some of the other early development projects like Quilish and some of the outside projects pushed off for right now, and rescheduling production over the next, especially 3, 4 to 5 years to see if we can smooth out that production profile, which will actually help from a cost standpoint and be more consistent over the next 3 years. We've got some work we're doing on water treatment that's coming in here in the next year or so to meet some of the higher end to -- for regulations that are being implemented in Peru. So that'll show up maybe early in the '13, '14 time frame. But right now, as we've got them -- we've got them looking at alternatives to really smooth out the production profile over the next 3 to 4 years before we go into decline.
Russell D. Ball: And Brian, Russ, just adding to that. We will be moving less tonnage, which clearly means that we will have less equipment and less people in those equipment moving that tonnage. That's part of the exercise Gary and his region working on. The challenge for us will be, can we reduce the costs by at least as much as the ounces to get to your per ounce number? We're still working through that exercise, but it would not surprise me to see reductions just given the change in the mine plan in the not-too-distant future.
Randy Engel: Brian, it's Randy. If you take the guidance that we've got, you've got about $350 million of operating costs attributable to Newmont there specific to Yanacocha base operations. I think, if you think about it in those terms and then you take into consideration what Russ described, you could see a reasonably stable total cost base for the next couple of years until it starts to come off harder in, say, the '15, '16 time frame.
Operator: Our next question from Michael Dudas, Sterne Agee.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Sterne Agee. Oh yes, regarding Conga, could -- can you maybe share, Richard, maybe some milestones or timing or when we might see a bit more clarity in the situation as you're modeling it out, say, for the next 6 to 12 months?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes. So our major milestone is to ensure that the first thing we do is keep our project people and the community safe. And as long as that's happening, the milestone is, continue to build the reservoirs on the schedule that we have. And on most days, Gary's project team is able to continue to move that forward smoothly. A lot of what you read about in the press is actually outside of ring [ph] 2 and, in some cases, even outside of ring [ph] 3 in demonstrations around Conga and around other issues in the community. So the milestones unfortunately in that area, political, social, community, I think are milestones which unfortunately we don't get to drive. But what I would say is that the President of Peru and his Prime Minister, we know -- even his new Prime Minister, who we've not had the opportunity to meet yet but hope to soon, will continue to foster a dialogue table, a listening table in some respects, to provide hopeful outcomes for mediation. And I would expect that, that will continue over the next weeks and hopefully in the next month and we'll see if we can get some outcomes of that. To date, that has not happened, but we have been able to continue -- as I said, on almost all days to continue to work on the reservoir construction. And we're hopeful that, that reservoir construction will generate the water that people apparently are more worried about than we believe they should be because that water delivery system, we know, will work and be better than what's there existing and that, as we do that, hopefully we'll earn credibility with the local community, for sure, and hopefully outside of that. And we just want to be mindful that the milestones that are out there are milestones that are, one, achievable and, two, we can drive. Unfortunately, with respect to the regional government and the central government, a lot of what's happening there is more on the political and government side and we just -- we don't know how to help in that other than participate in the dialogue table. And we're hopeful that those will continue to be sponsored by the right people and that we'll get the right discussion going.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I appreciate that answer, Richard. And a follow-up, maybe, I think, another political aspect towards -- turning to Ghana. With the untimely death of the President, as you mentioned earlier in the call, and with the transition there and with, I guess, elections coming up, any issues regarding transition or laws or legislations that would impede or maybe support or help your opportunities with the development of Ghana?
Richard T. O'Brien: The short answer is we don't see anything that's going to change that current environment in Ghana. I think, as President Obama has said historically, Ghana really is the shining light of democracy in West Africa. And it is that way because, even as the -- President Mills' election showed with less than 2% in terms of his voting in the last election, he came in smoothly with support of the Ghanaian people and really no issues in transition. We would expect that, that would continue to be the case in Ghana, which is 50-plus years into democracy. Our agreement, just to be clear, is one which has been approved by Parliament if for -- that covers both Akyem and Ahafo. On the other hand, that agreement is only as good as our continued commitment and the government's continued commitment to stay in dialogue about issues. And under Atta Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and, I would suggest, will continue to go on. And I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of the long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects. So Ghana continues to be not just a shining light for democracy but, I think, a shining light for Newmont. Okay. So that's the extent of our time today. Really appreciate your listening to our call and attending. And thanks for continued attention as we continue to deliver ongoing performance under our plan.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Executives: John Seaberg - Vice President of Investor Relations Richard T. O'Brien - Chief Executive Officer, President and Executive Director Russell D. Ball - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Gary J. Goldberg - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President Grigore Simon - Senior Vice President of Exploration
Analysts: John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont Mining First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Goldberg; Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive leadership team.  Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks as further described in our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.  And now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year during our Investor Day in New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders.  Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter; operating margins, up 29% on a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production, costs applicable to sales and capital spending.  Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and to provide additional financial flexibility. We recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments. Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana where construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga project and other projects in Peru.  As most of you have heard, the Conga project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010 after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the Perol waste dump in order to try to preserve the Azul and Chica lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics. Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users.  Conga's development would be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years, and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining. If Conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results.
Russell D. Ball: Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs.  Adjusted net income of $578 million, or $1.17 a share, was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million, for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the Holt property royalty. More detail on this can be found in Note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales. Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly. Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with a year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $620 an ounce, while up 11% from the year-ago quarter, were approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce on a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $1,684 an ounce.  Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we benefited by almost $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stockpile and leach pad inventory on hand and a similar increase in doré and concentrate receivables on hand at quarter end. And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million in early 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in Note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q. Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce due to highest [ph] workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and the higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we allocate operating costs on a coproduct basis. Higher spending added $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce lower, largely due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Higher-than-assumed diesel costs added $9 an ounce, with a stronger-than-assumed Australian dollar adding $7 an ounce net of hedge credits. And finally, lower sales volumes due to the lower production at Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce. You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them across the entire product life cycle, from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details on our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23. Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price-linked dividend policy. Based on a realized gold price of $1,684 for the quarter, the board approved a second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on June 28 to holders of record at the close of business on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter and a resulting yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price. Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 8 5/8% debentures and completed the Fronteer acquisition for cash outlay of approximately $2.1 billion. The first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada.  With interest rates at near record lows, we decided to access the debt capital markets to refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years, and at the same time, to term out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 at a pretax cost of 4 7/8%. The debt raising provides significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver on our growth profile through a combination of strong operating cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update.
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce. On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America, while Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower-grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts were reflected in our CAS, with APAC incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base. Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mined less material than in 2012.  Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter, and it will be again this year, due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roaster in Nevada, which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces. Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track, and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix Copper Leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro-winning plant is scheduled to begin in late 2012. Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3x to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a plan view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along strike which, when you look on the slide, is in the northeast, southwest, upper-right, lower-left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012.  For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated pre-feasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting. Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project, representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations. Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we processed some higher-grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also in alignment with our mine plan, which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits. Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed, and combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned. At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material, so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year. At the Tanami shaft project in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract. Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, up from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices. Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the ball mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We've recently poured first concrete at the primary crusher, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured the final floor sections of the mine services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnel slab core. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area. I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, Gary, and thanks, Russell. I'll wrap up by reiterating that execution has been and will continue to be job #1 at Newmont. And what do we mean by execution? We mean delivering safely on our goals for production, costs and capital. We also mean bringing projects into production effectively and efficiently. We believe firmly that our commitment to execution, paired with an emphasis on capital returns, both of and on capital, sets us apart in the industry, and we absolutely expect this focus to continue.  Thanks for listening to the call. And operator, we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from John Bridges, JPMorgan.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of guidance as to what sort of the changes in the plan in Peru at Conga could -- how big a change in cost could that have?
Richard T. O'Brien: John, that's precisely what we're evaluating. Just to put it in the context, as we are going through this review, which I expect will take a bit of time, we're evaluating both the technical aspects. And as I said, the first thing to recognize is that the EIA that we did, did meet all the technical requirements for its approval and did conform to both international and Peruvian standards. So we will continue to evaluate the recommendations around things that we should consider. When we evaluate that, we'll look at 2 things, both how it impacts the timing of the Conga project, as well as the cost. So that's something that we're in the process of evaluating. And recognizing that we just received the report last week, we're still in process on that. But I guarantee you, John, when we go through this, when we get to the point where we know what the cost structure would be, we are going to look at the economics of this project, just as we've said, and we feel that we have other options in the portfolio should those economics turn out to not be favorable and that's something that we could not go forward with. That said, that's not where we are today. We continue to evaluate.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And you've got a dividend to maintain as well?
Richard T. O'Brien: We do, and we feel absolutely good about maintaining that dividend with or without Conga.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And further on that, on the cost side, I see you've made a bit of progress there. Any areas that you feel you can focus on to better control costs?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, I think as Russell said, we have a number of areas where we are going to focus, and I think it goes right on through, as we look at the opportunities that we have in the world today, I think one of the things you're going to see is us focus more on select opportunities and really continue to build the early stage of the pipeline. But looking at exploration of the advanced projects, we probably will have some opportunities in that as we go forward even this year to reduce capital, yet not impact the plans that we have, and I'd say right on through project construction, where we are going to be looking in particular at our overheads, as well as the project teams that we have in place. And then right on through in the G&A, and when I say G&A, I mean the corporate-wide structure both in Denver and around the world to see where we have duplication. We have been investing, as we have talked about, in new systems. Our SAP rollout will be completed by the end of the year. We will be incorporating savings going forward from that as we look into our 2013 budget process and cycle. And in that plan, I fully expect that we will see costs come down across the company.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just finally, with this change to some of the Canadian reporting companies to IFSR (sic) [IFRS], then they seem to have more flexibility now on how they report costs. Would it be possible to get a bit more information on strip ratio so we can sort of better compare your costs with some of those guys?
Russell D. Ball: John, it's Russ. Yes, clearly, under U.S. GAAP, we have, as you, I think, alluded to, less flexibility around that reporting. We are looking at providing more information around an equivalent to a 43-101. We're working through some of the legal issues related there, too. We will endeavor, and John's group has been working on this to provide more of that color to let you guys do a better job modeling perhaps at our Investor Day on May 23. So you should look for more granularity around the projects on May 23. It probably won't get us all the way to where you'd like to be, but it'll certainly get us further than where we are today.
Operator: Our next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Yanacocha had a pretty good result going through the mill. The milling rate was well above what we thought on the grades. What should we be thinking about that going forward?
Gary J. Goldberg: Yes, David. It's Gary Goldberg here. We had higher grades in particular in the first quarter, and that was expected. Little better results and what might have been modeled at the one pit, but right now, we're still looking at staying within the guidance that we provided.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And the nameplate of the mill was around about 6 million tons per annum, but it seems to be overachieving. Should we -- is that just the softness of the ore at the moment? Or is that, that you've de-bottlenecked it so that we can see sustained good throughput?
Richard T. O'Brien: It's Richard, David. We have had success at that mill from really the day we started it to actually get over nameplate and maintain it there. And I think it's a combination of both the ore quality, but also, we have done a significant study over the last year or 2 on a business excellence study to get more throughput. And that's true of our mills around the world, but this is one where we actually see it in practice every day.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And I guess philosophically from the point of view of Conga, one of the appeals, I guess, of Conga was that it's like a trial mine of potential sulfides below Yanacocha. Where does the Yanacocha sulfides fit in all of this? Is it just still too nebulous for you to be thinking about it?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, so let me take that. Actually, what we said about the Conga project was that it was going to help get us more into copper, and it does have the quality of both copper and gold in a larger porphyry. It is a different deposit though than Yanacocha. This is a typical sulfide deposit -- or copper porphyry, rather. And when we're talking about the deposits below Yanacocha, it's significantly different in that it is a deposit which is going to require more technical work for us to assess the commercial practicability of actually producing that. And what I would say is, as we review Conga, we are reviewing all of our investments in Peru, including those potential deposits. So all of that is something that we're looking at, at the moment. And as we get to Investor Day and beyond, we'll keep you informed as to what we think of the prospects of those. So I think it's both timing and, as we've said, technical feasibility for those, so we'll keep you informed.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Switching back to Nevada, most of the work appears to be focused on Long Canyon. Has there been any work undertaken on Sandman or Northumberland that was also picked up with the Fronteer package?
Grigore Simon: Yes, this is Grigore Simon. Most of the focus is correct to – is at Long Canyon. At Sandman, what we are doing, we are moving the project into the pre-scoping and scoping phase, so we will be spending a bit more time there. As far as Northumberland is concerned, we are evaluating options in terms of further exploration progress, but we really didn't spend a lot of time there last year. And this year, it's a pretty small program overall.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Given the work on Sandman, is it -- is there potential for it to be brought on stream before Long Canyon?
Grigore Simon: Right now, honestly, I don't see how that one would happen because Long Canyon, it's -- looks much more prospective. So we will -- in the portfolio context, we will be pushing Long Canyon faster than Sandman at this stage. But again, it doesn't mean that we are not going to move along Sandman. It's just that it's not going to move at the same pace.
Operator: Our next question from George Topping, Stifel, Nicolaus.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Boddington was a little bit worse than we were expecting. And it looks like the grades fell 10% from Q4. Can you talk about where you see grades and production for Boddington through the remainder of the year, please?
Gary J. Goldberg: Yes, we do -- this is Gary again. George, we do see grades down from last year to this year, and that was built into our forecast for the full year production at Boddington. The challenge this past quarter was really mill throughput. We do a combination of some stockpiling there to ensure we get the good grades through the mill. But really, the issue this quarter was around an extended mill shut that went longer by 2 days than what we expected and the conveyor failure that we had with the motors. So don't expect that to continue. And actually, there's been quite an effort going on there, as Richard mentioned, in terms of the mill capacity work that's been done around the group. A lot of work has been done at Boddington to focus on making sure we get that whole mill production process up to speed, and we're really trying to push to make sure we can achieve what we believe is nameplate or maybe a little bit beyond here through the rest of this year.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. Are you looking at not having bounced back so far in Q2?
Gary J. Goldberg: I'm sorry, a what spike?
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Are you looking at Boddington production improving through the month of -- has it improved in April?
Gary J. Goldberg: I'm sorry, yes. We look at Boddington's production without the mill shutdown in place getting back in line with what we'd expect for the full year.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right, good. And then another question is on -- this is more -- this for financial, it's the dividends to noncontrolling shareholders. There's none in the Q1. Is one being made subsequent to the quarter, or was there none required to be paid?
Russell D. Ball: No, George, this is Russ. Yes, those -- that line that you see reflected in the financials is largely the dividend paid out of Batu Hijau. We have not declared one. We generally do it annually and do it towards the end of the year, so you shouldn't expect to see something until probably the fourth quarter.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. This is the noncontrolling interest?
Russell D. Ball: Yes, that's for the, effectively half of that project that we don't own.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right, yes, okay. And then just while we're on Indonesia, if you could fill us in on the -- how the political risk is evolving there. Because I noticed that's one of the areas where you are considering to invest more.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, I'll start. It's Richard. So I think the political risk in Indonesia -- we've been operating in Indonesia for quite some time. As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years. And as a result of that, we have almost continuous interaction with both the local community, who have an interest in the current shares that have been divested, as well as an interest in the potential shares. The central government, who is the buyer at least at the moment for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues and then solidly into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it along, which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, twice as big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe that the political situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract of work, and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions of that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process is full. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next. If that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct a refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue. But I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues. We've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government, and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time, of any mining company in Peru -- so I think -- or sorry, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia. No question, we've got to keep an eye on what's happening there, and elections are going to be coming up there in the next couple years as well.
Russell D. Ball: And George, just adding to Richard's comment, the additional investment we've contemplated on and off over the last decade is around a third SAG, so a mill expansion at the existing operation in Indonesia. And then just further on the exploration, we approved yesterday an unbudgeted request for $20 million for helicopter-supported drilling at Elang, which will give you an indication of our perspective on that risk profile.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO, for closing comments.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, everybody, for taking some time Friday morning to attend our call. And if you have questions, I know John and his team would be more than willing to take them, and we look forward to seeing all of you and even some people who aren't on the call at our Investor Day. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now I'd like to turn today's conference over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our executive leadership team.  Before we begin this morning, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2 as we will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.  And now I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold-linked dividend.  And while strategy sets the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment.  Also in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction at Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive returns do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation.  With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 million ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, one of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily.  I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia, where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already and we're adding a third. This is a longer-term prospective opportunity for Newmont, which is a large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And it's projects like Long Canyon and like Elang that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drill bit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont.  We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet.  In 2011, through our gold-linked dividend, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold-linked dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold price, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold-linked dividend, Newmont's share performance has more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers.  By delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well.  And I would just like to acknowledge one example of that in Gary Goldberg, who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the National Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come.  Turning to Slide 4. You'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North America and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth, while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth.  You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga project in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party re-review Conga's Environmental Impact Assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway, and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future.  However, as we stated back in November, should we be unable to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to reprioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives, with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia.  Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results.
Russell D. Ball: Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business.  For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion; adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share; and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs.  As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business through aggressive development of our project pipeline and through the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will add significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near-mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price-linked dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year.  In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011, and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure. And with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment-grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment.  Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations although, as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference, and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business, and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces aren't uncommon for us, especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to doré.  In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted, and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus, I think, the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrate sales shipments, which effectively price over a rolling 3-month period from shipment as opposed to doré, which essentially prices overnight.  Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less Phase 5 ore mined at Batu Hijau, resulting in the treatment of lower-grade stockpiles and also lower leach ore placement at Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa.  Gold cost applicable to sales of $591 an ounce was $1 above the high end of our original outlook, and I will go into that in a little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which will continue until the end of 2013.  Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $572 an ounce to the reported $591 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in Aussie dollar currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau.  The higher-than-budgeted realized gold price added $7 an ounce in higher royalties and workers participation. As I've commented on previous calls, we're more than happy to pay these incremental costs, given the significant related margin expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher by-product credits, primarily silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce, and a reallocation of certain mining-related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line reduced CAS by a further $7 an ounce.  Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price resulted in adjusted cost applicable to sales of $573 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mind that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar costs calculated under IFRS, due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping and stockpiles in particular.  Looking at the table on the right on Slide 7, net income for the year of $366 million was impacted by the following: a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis, or $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis, related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to place Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted-average cost of capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher-returning projects in the portfolio. The write-down had no effect on cash flow or reserves, and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January.  The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition; favorable tax planning opportunities which, by definition, are hard to predict added $65 million to the bottom line; and the loss from discontinued operations that arose during the fourth quarter on a royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking the above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share.  Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January. Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industry-wide inflation pressures, I would just note the following: the increase in Asia Pacific costs reflects the higher allocation of cost to gold through by-product accounting; higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms; the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012; and a higher Australian dollar assumption. Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and bulks drove most of that increase.  Moving to Slide 9. As we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago, is in line with our gold price-linked dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year on the S&P 500, the yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF.  And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business. And in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds.  I will now call -- turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results.
Gary J. Goldberg: Thanks, Russell. I'm really excited to be here. I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe, and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety, which is shared across the business.  Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their life in 2011 and clearly, this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012.  On Slide 11. Comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia Pacific.  From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts were also felt in our South America and Asia Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions. And in particular, we expected Asia Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpiled ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping Phase 6 and processing lower-grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013.  For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011.  Turning to Slide 12. Our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of slope remediation work at Gold Quarry, which is partially offset by lower production from our underground mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver by-product credits.  In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roster, as was the case in 2011.  Moving to Slide 13. Our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to lower leach pad ore placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver by-product credits.  Turning now to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 14. The year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs.  Turning to Slide 15. To shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013, and we expect to be back in the higher grade ores in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was just taken last week, we're looking towards the south, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north. That's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up at the top, and we'll be working our way down over the next couple of years to uncover the higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit.  I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio was greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, and was partially offset by higher production.  I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results.
Guy Lansdown: Thank you, Gary, and good day. Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011, while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper.  2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada. Supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America, we are conducting extensive development infill drilling at the Merian project in Suriname, with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby Sabajo project are coming up with promising results.  In the Asia Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Callie underground mine in the Tanami and at KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill programs should continue to add new underground mine life from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these sites have great exploration potential that we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012.  Meanwhile, in Africa, drill programs successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization, and we began drilling extensions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around Ahafo North demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs at Akyem suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with these programs in 2012 as we expand our exploration efforts in Ghana.  Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including ore exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion.  On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on copper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada.  Turning to Slide 19. We have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year, and we are very encouraged at the progress that we have made to-date. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the known mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of the slide, we have encouraging grade and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, expansion and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012.  From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects, which are currently in execution and were approved by our Board of Directors last year.  Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with civil and concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded, while the shaft pilot hole drilling is in progress.  Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, Guy. I'll conclude by reiterating our commitment to delivering shareholder value through execution on the 5 components of our strategy. We will pursue growth but not growth at any cost, and it will be growth that delivers competitive returns. Our 2011 performance affirms that Newmont will continue to execute on its operating base, continue to realize its exploration potential and continue to build competitive projects that deliver competitive returns.  And finally, by maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating robust operating cash flows, we will remain a unique investment platform because we can return capital to shareholders while providing competitive growth, delivering ounces which produce current cash flow and allow us to continue to drive the business forward, both for today and for the future. So combined, these components provide a powerful and compelling value proposition that we believe truly differentiate this company and position us for the future.  So with that, we'll be happy to take your questions and thanks for listening.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from John Bridges, JPMorgan.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wondered, the cash has gone down this year. You've got this commitment to a dividend now, which is obviously working very well for you. I just wondered if Russ was going to duck into his piggy bank to maintain it going forward.
Russell D. Ball: John, it's Russ. Yes, the cash was down. And I'd just like to remind people, we did pay cash for the Fronteer acquisition in April, $2.2 billion, because we didn't want to dilute our shareholders, knowing this was a long-term exploration plan. And as I mentioned earlier, we have deleveraged the balance sheet significantly over the last couple of years. And in today's interest rate environment, we are looking at an opportunity to answer at some [ph] long-term debt. And we are pretty conservatively geared, if you look at the financial metrics, and have plenty of flexibility. But you've seen the cash flow generation capacity of the existing assets. And in this gold price environment, we're blessed with that attribute. As Richard said, strong balance sheet, strong operating cash flows, we can fund the growth, the dividend and continue the investment in exploration off of our current business plans. So a great position to be in, John.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, so you're confident and that's nice to hear. And then maybe an operating question. It's probably a bit unfair given your short tenure there, but Boddington is on a run rate for 800,000 ounces a year. Could you talk a little bit about the progress with fixing up the plant and what you think it's capable of now?
Gary J. Goldberg: Gary here. John, the guidance is for 750,000, just to be clear, looking out for the next couple of years. And having visited there just 1.5 weeks ago, the work that's been done to upgrade and improve the conveyors, which was one of the bottlenecks that we had, is going to be completed later this quarter. And the team there and the work that's been done all looks in line to be able to achieve the 750,000 guidance that we've given.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Did you say -- I thought it was 750,000 to 800,000?
Gary J. Goldberg: I'm sorry. 750,000 to 800,000.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. Okay, cool. And if I might slip one last little one in, maybe. I see you've got a big inferred number there for Yanacocha now. Is that the sulfides that are beginning to come into play?
Guy Lansdown: John, this is Guy. Yes, I believe that's where the bulk of the inferred material will be coming in.
Operator: Next question from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Jorge with Deutsche Bank. I guess my first question is for Richard. Again, just following up on the Conga update that you gave us. What is the next key date as to when you expect that sign-off from the committee on the EIS?
Richard T. O'Brien: So Jorge, what we've been told is that from the time that the committee began its work was going to be 40 days for them to conclude their work. What we don't know is, at the time when that comes out, how long the government is going to want to review that outcome and when we'll find that out. So I would expect it's going to be at least 40 days from the time period when that was announced. We're hopeful that it's not an extended period beyond that 40 days, but we don't really know. So in the meantime, we continue to work at the site with the government just to ensure that things are maintained throughout the wet period as best we can. We continue to work on engineering and we continue to keep our project team together, while at the same time, Ramzi and Guy have worked hard to reduce current costs at Conga. So I think the best that we can do at this point is do everything we can to be flexible, be ready to go and be responsive to the government when the results of that EIA review come out.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. But some of the nature of the opposition to the project seems to be grassroots and related to -- I mean, could there be a worse-case scenario where you do get a clean bill of health on the EIS and the government signs off quickly, but then there's still another local round of opposition?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, so remember, I'm the CEO of a mining company. I'm not a politician, so what I have to say is just from my standpoint. But the Conga Project, I believe, is a well positioned, well studied project with a well-thought-out and, I believe, well planned EIA. I think we are doing everything we can to ensure that, that project moves forward. What happens in Peru, I really can't tell you what's going to happen in Peru. All I can tell you is that the president has spoken about the government support for Conga. And as you point out, there are regional politicians who have been opposed to Conga. How they settle that dispute, I don't know. All I can tell you is we commit that around the communities most closely to Conga, we're working very closely with those people. We want to embrace the fact that if there are reasonable changes that need to be made, we will make those, to make sure that we try as best we can to respond to any community concerns. We can't settle political disputes, but we will work hard to do everything in our power to make this go forward.
Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And if I can just squeeze a second quick question in to Guy. Just at Long Canyon, you said you'll have an NRM by the end of this year. Could you just kind of update us as to what you're looking at in terms of a conceptual resource size there at this point?
Guy Lansdown: If you'll recall, the target case was of the order of 2 million ounces. And we're obviously hoping to achieve as much of that as we can. We still got drilling underway. We still got steady work underway. We still got modeling we've got to do, but that's what we will be targeting.
Operator: Our next question from Patrick Chidley, HSBC.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on Long Canyon. Guy, did you say 2 million ounces or 10 million ounces?
Guy Lansdown: I wish it was 10 million ounces, Patrick. Sorry, the targets that we hedged at the time of doing the acquisition, the base case was 2 million ounces. The drilling work that we've done, the study work that we've done, that we will undertake, we'll be targeting 2 million ounces -- up to 2 million ounces for conversion to NRM later this year. So that is 2 million ounces.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, just to be clear on that, Patrick, what Guy said is 2 million ounces for NRM. That was the original plan that we saw at the time of acquisition. We also mentioned, though, that we saw a considerable upside over time. And at the time, we talked about the potential for up to 8 million ounces. What Guy is saying is not all of that is going to come in this year. We're going to continue that drilling program, and this is step one and in Phase 1 of what we expect to be a long-term development option here, which will provide us with considerable upside. That's what we said at the time of the acquisition. We still believe that, through all the exploration results we have today.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: All right. But Fronteer had already outlined 2.3 million ounces, I think. Is that in addition to the 2 million ounces, you mean?
Guy Lansdown: No, Pat, that's just 2 million ounces total of NRM that we'd be looking at bringing in. The numbers that were around or of the order of 2 million, I think, the Fronteer number was 2.3 million. We saw...
Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: So it would be a confirmation of their numbers?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that's correct.
Randy Engel: Patrick, it's Randy. I think that's absolutely what we're trying to say, the confirmation in the year 2012 of what was originally in the Fronteer numbers. And then, as Richard pointed out, we -- when we made the acquisition, we had anticipated considerably greater than that total amount over time. But what our question was trying to address was what we expect in 2012.
Richard T. O'Brien: So basically trying to take what was a potential resource that was working for Fronteer, and they had not yet declared yet to NRM a higher standard of potential definition throughout 2011. And the work we're doing in 2012, bring what they had as a hope to the reality of NRM, and we're doing that throughout 2012. And then we'll continue to bring that into reserve, as well as bring what we see as potential resource into NRM in future years. And with that, we still have the full expectation that we'll see 8 million ounces. That's what we see today. It's still early days, but confirmatory drilling continues to keep that right in front of us. So I'd say the acquisition case is good or better than what we had in place at the time.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: And then just a follow-ups also on your exploration programs. Can you outline what work went on last year in Nevada at Mike and Fiberline and the Greater Gold Quarry, and how that might play out this year?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, Patrick, what I'm going to do is ask Grigore Simon, our Vice President of Exploration, to talk a bit about that. And I did want him to address the question from John Bridges earlier around the inferred material at Yanacocha.
Grigore Simon: So I am going to address first John's question then. Most of the inferred material that the question referred to is coming from Conga, to be precise. To follow up on the question on Long Canyon, Patrick, that you had and the rest of Nevada, at Long Canyon, I think, you got the message that we are confident that we will deliver on the target case that we mentioned and look at this NRM as the very first step to get there. Going to Mike and Fiberline, what we have done is, we are still in the scoping study there, so we have done quite a lot of drilling in preparation for moving and advancing actually these ounces to an NRM category. So the programs remain on track. We are spending money on both, and we are dealing them both. And they look actually quite good. As far as Gold Quarry is concerned, Gold Quarry is going to deliver ounces for years to come. Just to give you an example, in the reserves program this year, Gold Quarry had the significant contribution again. It's almost 800,000 ounces just from pit expansions. If you look into the NRM, again, Gold Quarry came with significant ounces as part of the Phase 8. We expect to bring more reserves next year. So I will say that overall, all Nevada programs actually are very vibrant.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division: Very good. I hope to continue to hear more about those programs through the year and what the progress is toward that scoping study on Mike, in particular. And then one final thing, I just wanted to ask if -- is the appropriate strip ratios for the new reserves, is that available in the 10-Q? Or if not, will you provide it, please?
Russell D. Ball: Yes, it's in the reserve -- Patrick, it's Russ. It's in the reserve table in the 10-K. You can see the ore and the recovery and the strip ratio.
Operator: Next question from Mike Jalonen with Bank of America.
Michael Jalonen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, not to beat a dead horse, just on Long Canyon, Guy, what's the strike extent that you'll have there for that 2 million ounce target? And then a second question I'll have, what's the long-term plan for Hope Bay? Is that going to be vented out eventually?
Guy Lansdown: Let me talk about Hope Bay, while Grigore sorts through the extension question. At Hope Bay, what we're doing right now is putting it on care and maintenance, working with the local community and the government. And while we have some other potential options, we're not ready to talk about them at this time. What I would say, Mike, is that it's clear that there is gold at Hope Bay. How to recover it in an economic project is something that we believe, over time, could happen, and we'll continue to hold that possibility for us. As Russ said, though, to be precise where we are today, it's not in our development project pipeline. And with that, then we've taken off the amounts on the books so that we have some flexibility going forward, and we'll keep you posted as to what we do. So Grigore?
Grigore Simon: Thank you, Richard. The current footprint of the mineralization at Long Canyon is somewhere in the range of 800 meters to 1,000 meters. And as you -- as we have already mentioned, we managed to extend the footprint of that mineralization overall by about 25%. So to give you a sense in meters, it's about 450 meters extension to the north. And to the south, actually we are adding again about a few hundred meters. But please keep in mind that we are still early stage here. We have been there for almost a year now, and we really try to confirm the resource first before we were actually able to do any expansion drilling. At the same time, as you are probably aware, we had some permit limitations there in terms of the amount of exploration that we can do in the district, pending the extensions. Now we have secured these permits last year, and we expect this year to show much more district exploration.
Richard T. O'Brien: And just to build on that, one way to look at the confidence we have in the Hope Bay or -- sorry, in Long Canyon, is that we've actually -- as Guy said, we're getting ready to file our plan of operations. We've moved that up in our time frame by about 3 to 6 months, and that plan of operations is the first step in getting our permit to actually mine there. So we're actually moving very quickly to put this into both operations, while we continue to explore in the district. And what that says is that we're confident that we have enough material through our existing exploration program to go put a plan of operation in place, to get ready to permit that while at the same time, as Grigore said, moving outside, looking at extensions and seeing how far it goes. So I think what you can read into that is that we're pretty, pretty positive about where things stand at Long Canyon.
Russell D. Ball: Patrick, it's Russ. I just wanted to go back and correct. We have the tons -- ore tons and recovery. I'll ask John's group and I'll work with them to get the strip ratios up, and we'll put it on the website so that people can go in there and model it, to the best of our knowledge anyway.
Operator: Our next question from Paretosh Misra, Morgan Stanley.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you mentioned capital discipline as a central part of your strategy. So could putting some sort of maximum limit on CapEx be also considered?
Russell D. Ball: Sorry, I think the question was, would we consider putting a maximum limit on CapEx? And we consider, obviously, our ability to fund ongoing exploration. And capital does come in 2 forms in the sense of new projects, expansion capital and also sustaining capital. And we balance that investment with our expectations around gold price and the balance sheet strength. I'll say that if a project is delivering strong economic returns, we will find a way to fund it. Probably more of an issue for us, quite frankly, in this environment is finding the human capital to build it. So the balance sheet is obviously something we do spend a lot of time looking at. But in this positive environment, we can fund a number of projects. Getting the people and keeping the people to fund and to build those projects is probably the biggest challenge right now.
Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Understood. And then maybe just one more. How much of this Conga CapEx you will need to spend, should you decide to not proceed with the project this year?
Richard T. O'Brien: If we don't get the positive nod from the EIA, we have probably $600 million of capital right now that's planned, and I think we'll look at every dollar of that if we don't proceed with this, this year. There will be some ongoing remediation at the site when the dry season comes on us and we'll continue to work through that, but that will be a small portion of that capital. So we'll just keep you apprised as we see, going forward. In the meantime, we'll complete engineering. That's the only thing we really have planned at the moment as we were already demobilizing a lot of the other equipment at the site, preparing to come back when we hear about the EIA, so trying to minimize those costs but be ready to go. As I said, be flexible, be ready to go.
Operator: Our next question from Dave Hove, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Dave Hove - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Richard, just wanted to ask you, recently, we've seen on the news on Ghana that they're starting to review stabilization agreements. And also in Indonesia, that they are -- that in Indonesia that they're going to start to review your contract of work. What sort of impact do you think it would have on Newmont?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, it's a great question. And what I would say is that we have really been on notification in both countries for some time that the governments want to renegotiate. In both countries, we have -- in the one, Ghana, we have a parliamentarily approved, if that's such a word, stabilization agreement. And in the other, Indonesia, we have a contract to work. And we have indicated to both governments that, of course, we'll be flexible within reason. And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of a renegotiation, which are things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place in both of those countries, or taxes. But I would expect that on balance, it will not be material to the company, and that as we find anything out in those -- which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either one, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have one. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment -- and you see it across the world. It's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana. I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects, particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive. We have to be responsible, but what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need. It's a combination to make sure that we can continue to sustain the business, and that's the way we address these negotiations. We have certain rights, but we also have certain obligations in every one of these countries.
Dave Hove - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. And as a follow-up question on that, you saw that Elang is one of the projects which you talked about obviously [ph] . And with Indonesia planning on banning the exporting of unprocessed ore in 2014, they say, so what are the impacts on your plans with Elang based on that?
Richard T. O'Brien: That's also a good question. And again, I would suggest to you that my recent discussions with the government of Indonesia, prior discussions, I think Indonesia is trying to ensure, like a lot of countries, that they get the most out of not just the mining but also the mining and beneficiation of the resources owned by the country. How to get the most out of that, I think, is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they are still working through, and we're trying to help them work through, what the exact impact of that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with the Indonesian government, because we're going to need to get permits. And we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do, putting money in the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations -- before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you does the government. So what I would say is, while they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia -- they have to have that to support their growth, I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need. So at this point, what I'd tell you is, we have good exploration potential in front of us. We have some negotiations in front of us, and we'll see how things come out.
Operator: Our last question from John Tumazos, Independent Research.
John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC: I may be confused by some reports in the press, and forgive me for expressing the concern. I believe it was Mineweb that reported that part of the negotiation for Conga was a commitment that Newmont would guarantee a minimum of $2 billion in tax revenues. Was that report correct? And if you have to guarantee a certain threshold of tax payments before you earn the money, under U.S. accounting, would that show up on commitments and contingencies on the balance sheet?
Richard T. O'Brien: Let me take that, John. I'll start with the second question, which is we didn't commit to anything, so we're not going to report anything. I don't know what the standard is. But I'm pretty sure if we committed it, we would have to disclose that kind of contingency. But there's no way, if there was such a report, that, that's true. Obviously, we will pay the taxes that are due when they're due, and we'll pay them under the current regulations or how they change over time. But there are no minimums that we would commit to, nor have we committed to anything. So sorry you read that, but it didn't come from us.
John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC: If I could follow up. In addition to the NGOs, a particular issue -- and your guys have been working there 20 years, they're well aware, some of the indigenous people in northern Peru don't accept the government in Lima as legitimate. Now they think they were there before Pizarro. So if you encounter these local issues like roadblocks, et cetera, how do you work around the diversity of political opinion in the country?
Richard T. O'Brien: Well, as I said, John, I think that we're not politicians, but what we are is we have a lot of relations with people in the community. We have been working in that community since really early exploration activities took place in Conga, probably 10 years ago. As a result of that, we do try to stay plugged into what's important to those people. It's an agrarian community. As you point out, there's a lot of history there. I think the roadblocks come from a number of different parameters. They come from politicians. They come from local citizens who are concerned about water and jobs. And I think with respect to each of those categories, we provide what we provide, which is we provide a resource base. We can develop it. We can put people to work. We can provide taxes. And in this case, we can take water, which at the moment is not consumable, and we can turn it into something which is and which is more sustainable over time and which is more predictable, less seasonal. So I think we can provide what the community needs. And how politicians and others accept that is up to them. We can only do what we can do.  Well, with that, John, thanks for your questions, and thanks to everybody else for your attendance on the call. We really appreciate your attendance and interest, and thanks for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Again, today's conference has concluded. Please disconnect at this time, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on Newmont's third quarter 2011 earnings call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our executive leadership team.  Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2 as we will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, John. Those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we continued to advance our strategic growth plans. We achieved several key project milestones, including initiation of earthworks at Conga in Peru, and our first concrete pour at Akyem in Ghana.  Across our wider project pipeline, we have advanced approximately 20 earlier-stage development assets through our project pipeline in each of our 4 operating regions thus far in 2011. Our investment-grade balance sheet continues to strengthen as we delivered our 11th straight quarter of increase in gross margin, while generating quarterly records of revenue at $2.7 billion, operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and net income of $635 million adjusted. We also ended the quarter with over $3 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also continued to explore one of the most extensive land positions in the gold industry. Across our exploration portfolio, we are currently operating 100 drill rigs around the globe in over 40 locations, spanning greenfields and brownfields projects, as well as surface and underground opportunities.  And as we announced on Wednesday, we increased our dividend again for the sixth straight quarter to $0.35 per share based on our average realized gold sales price for the third quarter of $1,695. This is a 133% increase over the year-ago quarter. On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend stands at a yield of over 2%, which is higher than the current S&P 500 average yield and certainly the highest in the gold industry. And finally, thanks to the continued focus of our employees on disciplined execution, we are maintaining our outlook for production, operating costs and capital expenditures, as described further in our press release. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, to discuss our third quarter results.
Russell D. Ball: Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. As illustrated on Slide 4, I'm pleased to be able to talk to you this morning about another strong quarter of operating and financial results. Clearly, we benefited from a 39% increase in the gold price, realizing $1,695 an ounce, which was $7 or approximately 0.4% lower than the average of the daily fix. This was due to the timing of doré sales, concentrated shipments and mark-to-market adjustments at quarter end in what was a very volatile quarter. Details of the realized gold price calculation for the quarter and year-to-date are included in our 10-Q on Page 49.  Net income from continuing operations of $493 million was impacted by a noncash impairment charge of approximately $152 million on an after-tax basis. And this is related to marketable securities of Paladin Energy Limited, a uranium producer, and Pilot Gold, both acquired on April 6, 2011, as part of the acquisition of Fronteer. These charges were offset by a $10 million after-tax gain realized on the sale of a minority position in Lydian Resources. The net noncash impairment of $142 million equates to $0.29 a share on an after-tax basis and results in adjusted net income for the quarter of $1.29 a share.  Net income for the quarter was also adversely impacted by an effective tax rate of 36% due to some timing issues and a valuation allowance on certain capital losses. In comparison with the quarter, the effective tax rate for the first 9 months of the year was 30% and our estimated effective tax rate for the year remains somewhere around 30%. The standout number for the quarter was a continued strong operating cash flow generation of almost $1.3 billion, a 48% increase from the year-ago quarter. The portfolio continues to deliver on what we consider to be the most important determinant of long-term value, operating cash flow per share.  Moving to Slide 5. Gold production was down by about 7% from a year ago due to the transition from Phase 5 ore production to largely Phase 6 waste stripping at Batu Hijau in Indonesia and lower grades in mill throughput in Nevada. Gold cost applicable to sales of $622 an ounce was up 32% versus the prior year quarter due to a combination of lower production, higher input costs and a higher coproduct allocation of operating cost to gold from copper as a result of the relative outperformance of gold in the quarter. The coproduct accounting issue is, of course, just a geography issue on the income statement and has no bottom line impact.  Gold CAS on a net attributable basis was $556 an ounce, again up significantly as a function of lower copper production from Batu Hijau and a lower realized copper price. The realized copper price for the quarter of $2.94 a pound was 20% lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting both the weaker spot market during the quarter and a provisional pricing mark-to-market loss for the quarter of $74 million or $0.80 a pound. At the end of the third quarter, we had 102 million pounds of copper, provisionally priced at $3.24 a pound.  Slide 6 provides a little more detail on the increase in our cost applicable to sales. Increased operating costs, including unscheduled maintenance, higher labor and contracted services costs increased CAS by about $45 an ounce. Lower production at all of our assets, excluding Batu Hijau, at least on a portfolio basis, increased CAS by $36 an ounce. Lower production at Batu Hijau and the coproduct accounting issue discussed earlier increased gold CAS by about $27 an ounce. The balances of the factors on the chart are largely self-explanatory, with a stronger Aussie dollar, a higher gold price, higher fuel costs and lower byproduct, copper and silver revenues collectively adding $45 an ounce. However, with a strong fourth quarter expected, particularly for our Nevada operations as Pete Bajo, Exodus, Chukar and Gold Quarry add significant ounces compared to the third quarter. As such, our 2011 outlook for CAS remains unchanged at between $560 and $590 an ounce, although likely to be towards the upper end of the range. Remember that these numbers are calculated under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar cost calculated under IFRS.  On Slide 7, you'll see how are gold margins have expanded over time versus the gold price, as our disciplined focus on execution has yielded consistent margin growth despite industry-wide cost pressures. Based on current spot prices and assuming the top end of our CAS outlook for 2011, we expect our gold margin for the year to be in excess of $1,100 or approximately 65%, a healthy margin by any measure.  Turning to Slide 8 and our gold price-linked dividend policy. I wanted to take just a couple of minutes to explain the mechanics of the policy we originally announced in April, and then subsequently enhanced in September. Firstly, the amounts on the slide reflect annual dividend estimates. And since we pay a quarterly dividend, we need to divide the annual amounts by 4 to get the quarterly equivalent. The amount of the quarterly dividend payable is determined by the trailing quarters realized gold price, which can be found in our Form 10-Q and 10-K filings as discussed earlier.  The dividend payable in December announced earlier this week of $0.35 a share reflects the realized gold price of $1,695 an ounce for the third quarter. Based on a $65 share price, this results in an effective annual yield of approximately 2.1% or approximately double that of our peers. At gold prices between $1,100 and $1,699 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.20 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. At Gold price is between $1,700 and $1,999 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.30 a share for every $100 change in the gold price. And then at gold prices between $2,000 and $2,599 an ounce, the dividend increases or decreases by $0.40 a share for every $100 change in the gold price.  The result of this formula is that our shareholders will see an increasing share of incremental operating cash flows as the gold price increases. We are able to share these incremental cash flows based on the fact that we have the highest leverage to gold prices through the highest gold production per share outstanding. This allows us to pay the highest dividend per share while still investing organically to grow the business at the top line level.  We have been consistent in our belief that at the end of the day, per share metrics has to matter. I believe this commitment to returning capital to our shareholders distinguishes us from our peers and the gold ETF in particular, and provides a compelling investment thesis, especially in the current interest rate environment. With that, I'll turn the call back to Richard.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thanks, Russell. An overview of our attributable Q3 results by region can be found on Slide 9, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell has already discussed the key production and cost variances from Q3. And full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can also be found in the release, or in our 10-Q. So rather than restate what's already been written, I'll discuss some relevant updates from our operations, and then we can devote a bit more time to your specific questions.  We recently announced some organizational changes, which will further strengthen Newmont's leadership team. Gary Goldberg will join Newmont on December 5 as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And Brian Hill will be taking on a new leadership role as our Executive Vice President for Sustainability and External Affairs. Gary joins us from Rio Tinto, where he spent approximately 30 years, and he will be responsible for our worldwide operations, business excellence, health, safety and loss prevention and security. Since joining Newmont, Brian has been instrumental in leading strong and consistent performance from our operating portfolio, and in addition, has built a world-class operations leadership team and has assisted invisibly leading Newmont's culture shift. In his new role, Brian will help Newmont stay at the forefront of sustainability and stakeholder alignment on a global basis. We believe that bringing ESR and Government Relations under the same leadership will enhance Newmont's effectiveness in each of these disciplines at a time when our industry is facing growing challenges to access and government approvals.  Turning to Slide 10. Our North American Q3 results were down from last year's third quarter due to lower than expected grades, as well as mine sequencing changes. At Leeville, we had a slight movement in our ventilation/backfill shaft, which impacted planned stope sequencing. The shift is being repaired -- the shaft is being repaired and we are utilizing a secondary backfill delivery system in order to safely maintain our Q4 production level and into 2012. Since completing our remediation work at Gold Quarry this quarter, the pit has been resequenced and we are encountering higher grade mill feed, which should continue throughout Q4. We have also successfully ramped up the Exodus mine and expect to continue to produce at targeted tonnages. Slightly lower grades are reflected in the revised outlook, and we are ahead of schedule with the development of a Pete Bajo underground mine, as we are producing more tons at higher grades than anticipated.  And while as Russell stated, we're expecting a strong fourth quarter in Nevada, I can tell you that those plans showing that strength do not put at risk our performance in 2012. The team in Nevada feels confident in its capabilities to deliver this quarter and continuing into 2012 and beyond. In Mexico at La Herradura, quarterly and year-to-date attributable production reached record levels due to increased ore placements at La Herradura and higher ore grade at Soledad and Dipolos. Construction of the Noche Buena mine remains on schedule for completion in the first half of 2012. We are also supporting our partner as they embark on the construction of a gold mill that will have capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis.  Moving to Slide 11. As you've probably read, recent roadblock activity has intermittently affected access to our Yanacocha mine and the Conga and Western Oxides projects this month. Mining operations in the pits were temporarily suspended but are now back to full operation. We continue to engage with central and regional government and community leaders to understand and address the concerns of our stakeholders in that region. Our team in Peru continues to do a very commendable job of working with local authorities for the safety of our people and the public.  Turning to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 12. Regional volumes and costs in the third quarter were impacted, as Russell said, by the planned Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, work continues on optimizing the dry plant conveyor circuit to improve availability. Also at Boddington, CAS increased by $102 per ounce, driven mainly by lower tons mined at lower grade, 7 days of unscheduled downtime, mostly related to the conveyor issues, higher coproduct allocation of cost to gold, higher operating costs, and other gold-related costs such as royalties, partially offset by a favorable A dollar exchange rate variance net of hedges. Meanwhile at Jundee, we've increased exploration programs to expand mineralization and we are adding mineral inventory in new areas, reporting an extended mine life.  I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 13 with Africa. Ahafo's production was down slightly versus the prior year quarter due to lower mill grade, which impacted CAS, as well as higher labor, diesel and royalty costs. In Q3, we successfully completed our AKOBEN audit. This is Ghana's annual EPA review, and Ahafo achieved a blue rating for 2010 performance, 1 of only 2 mines in Ghana to receive that high rating. The Ghana region continues to be our highest growth portfolio region in our portfolio, and we continue to see numerous opportunities around the Ahafo mine for expansion.  Concluding on Slide 14. As I noted earlier, we continue to make good progress in advancing our strategic growth plans in each of our 4 regions. And I'd like to close today's call by noting some of the key milestones we've achieved across our development portfolio. At Akyem, since full funding approval in March 2011, the project has continued to advance with confirmation of the main civil and mechanical construction contracts, commencement of bulk earthworks and civil activities, the first structural concrete pour and the establishment of the first set of resettlement villages.  At Conga, following the full funding approval, the project has continued to progress: infrastructure works, earthworks construction, drilling, detailed engineering, procurement of materials and equipment and securing remaining permits for construction. At Tanami, following full funding approval in July, the development efforts have progressed according to plans. The pilot hole for the shaft has been completed and the contractor is mobilized. The project will support underground expansion at the Callie and Auron ore bodies, reduce cutoff grade, enhance productivity and facilitate additional mine expansion. The project is expected to add average annual attributable gold production of approximately 60,000 to 90,000 ounces during the first 5 years of production, while also lowering costs applicable to sales for the first 5 years by approximately $100 per ounce.  And at Long Canyon in Nevada, drilling is focusing on infill, mineralized extensions and district exploration. Extension drilling continues to highlight growth potential. We have advanced our studies and are on track to submit our plan of operations to begin the permitting process in the first half of 2012. Also in Nevada, we continue to work on several projects, including Pete Bajo, which achieved commercial production last month and is performing above our expectations with better grade and higher tonnage. At our Emigrant project, which is on schedule and on budget, we expect to start mining in the second quarter of 2012, with the first ounces expected to come off the leach pads later next year.  At Twin Creeks, we received regulatory approval to commence mining at Vista 7 and we initiated stripping. And at our Phoenix operation, we're preparing to construct a copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year, beginning in the second half of 2013, which should reduce our CAS in Nevada. We're also studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase Phoenix's copper and gold production.  Meanwhile, in addition to the projects receiving full funding decisions in 2011, as I've just described, we're continuing to evaluate longer-term opportunities within the portfolio, such as the Sleeping Giants, Elang, Hope Bay, Cerro Quilish and others. We will keep you up to date on our key decisions and milestones on each of these opportunities as we reach and push through them.  Finally, as I've said recently, our company is well positioned, with the right teams in place, a robust portfolio of development projects, the financial strength and flexibility to fund growth, internal growth, and generate economic returns for our shareholders. And as Russ described, we believe we have an industry-leading and unique dividend linked to the gold price. So taken in combination, and as you can see in the record earnings and margins that we continue to earn in this business, we believe that we offer both gold and generalist investors one of the most compelling investment opportunities available, particularly in the current economic environment where world instability and currency continues to build what we believe is a very attractive market for the gold price. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from John Bridges, JPMorgan Chase.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was just wondering you mentioned the problems at Conga, but it seems as if the problems have changed. They've changed, I understand, from people being unhappy about mining to people being interested in how they can benefit from it. I just wondered if you could fill us in a little bit on that.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, John, I think it's fair to say that Conga has been the best of community engagement in getting our permits and the not-so-best in terms of when we're actually in the field and beginning construction. And how does that arise? The permit that we received in support with 3,000-plus members from the community involved a lot of one-on-one engagement of our team in Peru with all of the regional authorities, as well as all the people who live in the region. And as a consequence of that, we've got a big push and support and no one showed up at that initial permitting hearing in anything other than a supportive position. So we started from a very great position. And I think what's happening now, John, is probably as we should expect over the next year or 2 as we continue in construction, we will see this intermittently from time to time. As people, I believe, first, they recognize that we have a lot of people out in the field now actually beginning construction rather than just talking about it. Second, I think they are interested in making sure that their land and water are taken care of and that's something we are absolutely committed to. And thirdly, as you know, we can't every offer everybody a job in the community, but we are really trying to involve the local, local contractors and their employees in participating in what we're doing in the region so that they, too, share in the economics. And I think it's that balance that we will have to continue to explain to people that we are both up for the environmental and social challenges and we want to meet those in ways which are responsive to the community. We're also up for making sure that we provide a long-term basis upon which we can operate in the region, which means we're just going to have to continue to engage with the regional authorities, the people who live in the region. And even as we're seeing here, people from outside the region who are using this as a platform for whatever ill they see in either the country or Peru or related to mining.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then on a happier note, people seemed to be very interested in your dividend. I just wondered whether you might consider putting it onto a sort of variable schedule rather than a step change to avoid missing the step by $5.
Russell D. Ball: John, it's Russ. I'd just go back to the last quarter where we made that step by $1 and we didn't hear a lot of noise at $1,501 and we seemed to have heard an incredible amount of noise at $1,695 wherever we are. John, I think at the end of the day, we'll just stick with the policy. We have tried to make it as clear as possible. And in the event we want to revisit that, we'll let you know, if and when we decide to. But for now, we're holding a course on the adjusted policy, which shares, quite frankly, a significant amount of those operating cash flows and the higher metal prices with our shareholders.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, we're thinking about handing out gold calculators to calculate our gold-linked dividend.
Operator: Our next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I've got a question for Batu Hijau. Third quarter, you're usually at the bottom of the pit with the dry season. How is the current quarter looking? Have you had to retreat out of the bottom of the pit? Or are you still in the higher-grade material?
Russell D. Ball: Dave, it's Russ. The third quarter at least for us is a bit of an anomaly. We have effectively mined out all of the Phase 5 ore. There was a little bit left behind from last year, so we are now in the heart of Phase 6 stripping, the wet season is approaching and we will be producing largely from stockpiles until towards the very end of 2013 when we get back into Phase 6 ore.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, I'd like to think of it as we were in bonus time in Batu Hijau Phase 5. We actually thought we were closed out last year, but had a little better weather. And as Russ said, we were able to take advantage of that.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay, so tons up and grade down maybe for the next year in a bit. All right. At Yanacocha, I noticed the costs moving up. One of the commentary that we had seen in your report was that there was worker participation, royalties, high diesel. What should we be thinking about for the cost base going forward there?
Russell D. Ball: Dave, for the year, we have provided in the appendix the updated guidance ranges for the regions. You should look to that. We have had some short-term geotech around El Tapado, which is a deposit that was going to deliver a significant proportion of our ounces this year. So we're working around that and we're working around that in a safe manner, and safety above production as always. So we're addressing that issue and that will really be a function of how and when we can access that ore and how much we have to lay back that slope. So you have the guidance for the year. We'll be somewhere between $560 and $600 for the year.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: I was thinking further a feel than just this year, Russ.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, as we go forward, David, what I was going to say is I think at Yanacocha, you can continue to expect some labor escalation. I think we're going to see that throughout the portfolio next year. And in addition to that, at Yanacocha, as the mine gets older, we have less flexibility between pits. And so as Russ mentioned, if we continue to see geotechnical issues at Yanacocha, you can expect to see both positives and negatives, depending on where we are going forward with that. In general, I think that we should expect industry kind of wide inflation numbers to impact us at Yanacocha similarly, whether that's around 10% or so from year-to-year or slightly higher, depending on where exactly we end up with some of the grade and other issues at Yanacocha.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. To Boddington, grade off this quarter, saw some of the commentary and listened to what you were seeing. What should we be thinking about into next year? Should we be looking at getting back into the blue grade [ph] material through 2012?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, we'll provide some more precision around guidance for 2012 later in the year. So we'll be able to give you a more of a heads-up on that. I would just say we continue to shake Boddington out on the operational basis. As I mentioned, we had some issues with the conveyor this year. We also had one of our rope shovels that was not available for parts of the quarter. And we're seeing a little bit more rehandling this quarter than we would like to see. So I would hope in a steady-state basis, that we are going to see even though the grades may not change significantly, I think we are going to expect to see a higher ore production rates going forward, hopefully more consistency in the dry plant and particularly in the conveyor part of the dry plant. And the wet plant continues to operate very well. So I think we have capacity and we just have to figure out how to use it. As I look at this, I think Boddington is a place where, much like we've seen at Ahafo, at Leeville, at Phoenix over time, we will certainly improve the performance out of Boddington as we continue to shake it out.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And for the balance of the year, it looks like a bit of a challenge to get to the guidance level. So are you expecting to pull something off in the fourth quarter or more of the same?
Richard T. O'Brien: And there, are you speaking specifically, David, at the portfolio level or at Boddington?
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Boddington.
Richard T. O'Brien: At Boddington. Yes, I think what we're expecting is to not have some of the downtime that we've had, mining more ore tons. I think the team has a plan in place and I'd say for the first month or so, we feel like we're kind of on that plan. So hopefully more of that and less than the unplanned downtime.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Right. For both Boddington and Batu, you'd mentioned also on the commentary that there was a higher coproduct cost allocation to gold. Just what do you mean by that? Is that just on the basis of the gold-to-copper ratio or what else is at play?
Russell D. Ball: Yes. So Dave, the ounces and pounds are obviously constant. But it's the relative performance of the gold price versus the copper price that determines how we allocate operating costs to the gold ounces or to copper pounds. So what we saw this quarter, significant outperformance in gold relative to copper. And what that does is drag ounces from copper pounds to gold ounces. And at the portfolio level, somewhere between $10 and $15 an ounce. Remember, most of our copper is coming out of Indonesia, and to a lesser degree, out of Boddington.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Last question, you've had Fronteer assets for a little while now. I didn't see an update on what you're current thinking is. Have you had a chance to had a look at what you've got there, particularly at Long Canyon?
Richard T. O'Brien: David, what I would say is we have. We continue to pretty aggressively drill that up. And as I mentioned, we are getting prepared to file a permit application in the first half of next year. And as we do that, we'll be able to give you a much more current information on some of the drill results. What I'd say is we continue to see very positive implications of what we see out in the field. And I know most of my team was out in Nevada a couple of weeks ago and had a chance to visit the site. And I'd say to date, it's right on what we thought we were going to get out of this. And we'll continue to keep you informed.
Operator: Our next question from Brian MacArthur, UBS Security.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just want to go back to the dividend. And as you pointed out, last quarter was a plus, this quarter was a minus. But can you just go through exactly how the realized price is calculated? I know there's Page 49. But can you clarify, when you have concentrate sales -- because obviously as we get around quarter end, this could be important and as that Batu Hijau ramps up later, 2 years from now and produces more, is it priced to your concentrate at the time it sailed [ph] for this pricing calculation? Or is it actually the sales when you realize it from the refinery at the end, i.e. what I'm trying to get a bit is does it both move over quarter-end or whatever? It could move like the price couple of bucks, which obviously makes a difference in this whole calculation.
Russell D. Ball: Sure, Brian, it's Russ. There's a couple of things. The biggest determinant is the timing of when we actually sell our doré, and especially in a volatile quarter like this, what we saw is we generally do a flat -- we try and flatten that sales profile. And we just didn't hit the peak, so to speak, for the quarter. The issue on concentrate, and to answer your question directly, is both. When we sell, we declare and we recognize provisional revenue based on the spot price the day of sale. We only get paid somewhere around 97.5% of that because the smelters take that as a discount, and that's pretty standard terms. Then at the end of the quarter, we are forced to mark-to-market. And then in a down quarter, obviously, we saw that on the copper side. We saw a slightly positive adjustment as you'll see on Page 49. So there's a number of factors moving around. The provisional pricing is much less of an issue in my mind than the volatility in this quarter. So really it was question of timing. And when you see a $100 swing, that could make a big difference in your realized price for the quarter.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: No, I get all that. I'm just worried about the situation, as you tons go [ph] up in the future, whether that's theoretically can move it by $2 at quarter end or something. Because if you come out like at $1,699 at sometime, you're going to get even more questions because of that as opposed to just volatility on the gold price. So that's why I just wanted to clarify that. The other thing it's done on consolidated, right, the sales?
Russell D. Ball: Correct.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And again, as you buy or sell them, to Batu Hijau, again, that will change the whole -- that won't change the calculation then, I guess?
Russell D. Ball: No, it won't because again the numbers in the Q and the K are all consolidated. And that's what we tied back. The key issue for us was providing a transparent link into the mechanics, which we hope that the table on Page 49 would guide people to and at least let them understand the mechanics and see them from quarter-to-quarter.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: No, that's very helpful. I'm not trying to be nuisance. I just want to clarify it exactly because it's obviously going to be important when you look at, as you said, this quarter, you had a 20% -- the $5 cost you 20% in the dividends.
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes, Brian, it's Richard. I think unintended consequences, trying to get people focused on a gold-linked dividend. We had to focus to something, we wanted it to be transparent. Look, we don't call our people up out in the field and say, "Move the shipments around a little bit so that we can adjust the price." We're also not hedging into a quarter. We're really just trying to let this be an effective price. I think it is so interesting that with that link now, I've heard more talk about average effective gold price with all the gold companies. I think it's great. Just keep asking everybody about how that ties to their dividend policy and we'll be in great shape.
Operator: Our next question from George Topping, Stifel.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: See, I noticed there was no cash payments to minorities in Q3. Was none all due to CapEx or is something carried forward?
Russell D. Ball: George, it's Russ. We actually declared a dividend in early October out of Indonesia, so you'll see that in the fourth quarter.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you tell us how much that is or...
Russell D. Ball: It was $200 million.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. Moving onto Boddington's Q3 grade. Did that reconcile to the block model? Was that as you were expecting for Q3?
Guy Lansdown: This is Guy. The block model that we've got at present is performing well. The grades that we are mining do reconcile back to the block model, so we feel pretty confident with where we are in regard to the grades the block model does have itself. One of the challenges is mining at the rate that we're meant to. We mined at a bit of lower rates than we had planned for the quarter. And as Richard said and Russell said, we are having challenges on the dry plants, but we have a team that is getting on top of this. We've got a project in place to upgrade those conveyors as we speak. And in addition, we're looking at some debottlenecking projects to further debottleneck the dry plant because that's where our bottleneck is. Our opportunity to increase production is in the dry plant. Our wet plant is operating much better than performance. So I would expect that once we get our mining rates up to where they are planned to be, our grade will come along with it.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. And then finally just on Yanacocha. We were anticipating more tons being placed on the heap leach. How are things shaping up there for the expansion for going into Q4?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes. I'd say at this point, we look to be on plan for Q4 at Yanacocha, really don't anticipate any issues. And part of the cost structure in -- or sorry, this last quarter having to do with an adjustment on the heap leach, we're not expecting any of that in the Q4 at the current moment.
Russell D. Ball: And George, it's Russ. Just adding to that, we have seen as we step out onto the margin of these deposits more transitional materials and the paleosoil material, which we are stockpiling. And we're referring [ph] at when that goes in either through the mill or on a dedicated leach pad. So we have seen more of that material and that's going into inventory, as opposed to going on the heap today because of obvious concerns around recovery.
Operator: Our next question from Mike Dudas, Sterne Agee.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: First question is, one, could you maybe characterize how the labor contractor, equipment rig markets are relative to what your near-term plans are? And also, as you're ramping up the capital spending, are things getting pushed out as it gets more difficult to find the quality people contractors and getting first in line for equipment?
Guy Lansdown: Mike, it's Guy. This is obviously a challenge for everybody, capital cost inflation. The approach that we've taken is on our major projects, we've got our EPCM contractors locked in place. We've got good teams, not only from our perspective but also from our EPCM teams. We are locking in contracts, the construction contracts as we speak. As we said at Akyem, we have all of the major construction contracts in place except for one. And at Conga, we continue to bid out the work. But we have the earthworks construction package in place, and we're bidding the remainder as we speak. So we feel pretty confident that we've got an approach that will address that risk. In addition to that, our equipment, we have placed purchase orders and the like for long-lead equipment such as mills and mining equipment. So we feel relatively confident that we've got good plans in place. In addition, we've allowed metal ounces for escalation in line with industry escalation rates that we can expect. So we feel relatively confident going forward.
Russell D. Ball: Mike, it's interesting -- it's Russ. When you look at the portfolio, North America now for us is one of the more cost-competitive environments to do construction and projects. And to Guy's point, if you look at the Western Australia, in particular, and South America, whether it's Peru or Chile, those are probably the more challenging. So you have look at it on a regional basis. It's not a one size fits all as we see this sort of to speed recovery in the world today.
Guy Lansdown: Yes, Russell is absolutely right. So in North America, we're going to have -- our projects are not going to face as a big challenge as they would, to Russell's point, in Chile and Australia. Peru is hotting up a bit, but we feel we're ahead of the markets and ahead of the projects that are likely to come out. And in Africa, we're in a good position with regard to where we are with contracts and the like. So we feel confident with our path forward.
Richard T. O'Brien: And Mike, it's Richard. I'd just say that one of the benefits of the portfolio projects we have is it's diversified across the regions. It's not one all big project. We have a number of different-sized projects, and I think that allows us to see the whole portfolio. In some places, we'll have more escalation. In others, there'll be less. So I think that's one of the great things about having a larger portfolio and then certainly, we had several years ago.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Yes, definitely we're going to get some more credit for your U.S. operations and valuation going forward. My second is, I guess, maybe if Randy's there. When you're looking at -- given your pipeline of projects and the advance that you've made over the past couple of years, how do you characterize -- are you changing the return requirements? Or how you look at what's important to Newmont when you're looking at potential acquisitions, either in size or in adding balance to the company going forward?
Randy Engel: Mike, really, it's the 5 main criteria that we keep talking about. We're looking for anything that helps us enhance the combination of competitive growth. On returns, we look for returns usually in that kind of mid-teen level at a relatively conservative metal price, which isn't the easiest thing to do when you burden up acquisitions with premium. We also look at, number three, at opportunities that enhance our exploration position. We obviously try to balance out by keeping our balance sheet intact. As we've talked before, as Richard and Russ both mentioned, we have a bias toward keeping our share count down. We just put all of those into the mix and those criteria continued to be at the forefront of our thinking on M&A as well.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: So no real changes given the structure and the shape of the market?
Randy Engel: No, not really.
Richard T. O'Brien: I would say just one thing that Randy and the team have been working on is pretty specific country-level cost-to-capital reconciliation in terms of where we see risk, how that risk portfolio is looking, which allows us, again, to look into that entire portfolio and rate and rank our properties and projects across the risk spectrum. So I think a little more precision with that is helping us well.
Randy Engel: Yes. Mike, I think is rather than change our criteria, what we're is we're seeing perhaps more favorable opportunities as our currency rises.
Operator: Our next question from George Topping, Stifel.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just a quick follow-up. I was interested in Conga in Peru, the role of the new Humala government, have they been in contact with you or talked to you, pressurize perhaps? Any information you can give us on that?
Richard T. O'Brien: Yes. This is just my impression after talking with Carlos Santa Cruz, who is our Regional Vice President. And if you look at the outcome of what's happened since President Humala has been elected, first, throughout his campaign, he was very clear that there was going to be a mining tax put in place shortly after his administration came into office. And when he was elected, shortly after he came into office, he called the mining companies just as he said he would. We engaged in discussions with them. And I think in a relatively short period of time, the mining companies working together and together with the government came up, I think, with something which will be implemented here shortly. But I think something that works for the country, works for us, I think, recognizes that mining is an important and integral part of the economy in Peru. And I think as a result of that, we feel like we were included in the discussion. He gave us a heads-up on what he was going to do, and then it got down to the specifics and we got through it. As we get into Conga, I think that is more of a regional issue than a central government issue. But I would say, again, between ourselves and Buenaventura, I think working closely with central and regional governments, because the central government obviously helps to set the pace for the country and I think can influence the regions in the right way. And I think when we are sitting down with them in the last -- when we have been in the last couple of weeks, we see the kind of support that we would hope for and the kind of leadership that we would hope for. So what I would say is so far, our experience has been very good. We continue to hope that if we engage, they will support and engage back. And so far, that seems to be the case. I think as we get down into the regions and in particular -- these are not what they're called, but what I think of them, the micro regions of the various mayoral districts around Conga, that is really an individual to individual kind of approach. And I think those are more complicated because each of those has their own kinds of outcomes that they're looking for, their own set of priorities and those are not necessarily set with or in conjunction with the central government. So it's kind of piece by piece, which is why if you ever go out our Conga site, you'll see we have a fairly big environmental and community responsibility team. That team is out engaged with the community to make sure we do know what the issues are. And I think even in this period over the last month, we knew there was activity coming. We're pretty well plugged in. What we're trying to do is to respond to those things and let people know that we will listen and that they don't need to stand in the road to protest because that's what leads to people either being in an area where there might get hurt, luckily, that's not happened. But we do have lots of equipment and people out there, and we're just going to ensure that we do everything possible to keep the community, our contractors and our employees safe, while we continue to build the project.
Operator: Our last question from John Tumazos, Independent Research.
John Tumazos - Independent Research: I pay great attention to the successor companies. After a team of geologists find something like Long Canyon and sell it to a good company like Newmont. And maybe, Richard, to Newmont Mining, such people not on your payroll, outside your company are just as important as your own exploration department. While GAAP accounting requires you to write down Pilot Gold because its stock price fell this past quarter, it surprised me that we didn't hear you say that we bought x million shares of Pilot Gold in the open market because it was a good investment or something like that. Or the other successor to the other half of the team, Renaissance gold. Do you pay particular attention to these project generator companies?
Richard T. O'Brien: Let me start and then Randy can jump in. John, we've got plenty to do here. And really, we are not trying to build value for shareholders through investing in other companies. Our job is to invest in our assets, our people, the projects that we have. And look, with Pilot, we actually -- well, with both of these securities, as we took them in, we actually had some restrictions on our ability to sell them for the first 4 months. We're just now into that period of deciding what we're going to do with the securities. But we don't really watch successor companies. We've got plenty to do on our own.
Randy Engel: John, it's Randy. We held on to 19% of Pilot. We felt that, that was a prudent level to hold onto. We tried to keep a good connection with each of those companies and it fits into the portfolio. Our sense is that we've got a good balance of those, and we will keep an eye on them going forward.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard O'Brien. Thank you, sir.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thank you very much. And thanks to all of you for attending our conference call today, and we'll look forward to seeing some of you between now and February when we have our next. Thanks a lot.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Randy Engel - Executive Vice President of Strategic Development Richard O'Brien - Chief Executive Officer, President and Executive Director John Seaberg - Vice President of Investor Relations Guy Lansdown - Executive Vice President of Development Brian Hill - Executive Vice President of Operations Russell Ball - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co Patrick Chidley - HSBC Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to turn today's conference over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you, sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2011 earnings call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brian Hill; Executive Vice President, Operations; Guy Lansdown, Executive Vice President, Discovery and Development ; Randy Engel, Executive Vice President, Strategic Development; and other members of our management team who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2 as we will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we continue to focus on delivering growth, generating profits and returning capital to shareholders. On April 6, we closed the Fronteer Gold acquisition and began our drilling program at Long Canyon, Nevada. We've now completed over 20,000 meters of drilling at Long Canyon, some encouraging initial intercepts identified earlier this month. At the same time, our discovery and development team remains focused on advancing several key projects in our growth plan as evidenced by Wednesday's announcement of full funds approval for our Conga and Tanami projects. As you may remember, we also announced full funds approval for our Akyem project in March. Collectively, those projects, Conga, Tanami, Akyem and Long Canyon will deliver over 1 million ounces of annual gold production when completed. Meanwhile, our existing top rating teams continue to focus on execution and cost control, providing our shareholders with continuing margin expansion in a rising gold price environment. Our second quarter highlights included an average realized gold sales price of 1501, allowing us to boost our dividend to $0.30 per share for the third quarter. This is a 100% increase over our third quarter 2010 dividend. On an annualized basis, Newmont's dividend yield is now an industry leading over 2%. This is higher also than the current S&P 500 average yield. We're also maintaining our outlook for production and cost attributable to sales and capital expenditures. And although capital spending through the first half of 2011 has been lower than expected across the portfolio, we do expect to accelerate capital spending in the second half of the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Russell, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our second quarter results.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Richard. Turning to Slide 4, you will see our second quarter operating results, which benefit from continued strong metal prices, solid production that was slightly ahead of budget and good cost containment across the portfolio. As Richard mentioned, we're maintaining our full year 2011 outlook, and we're on track to meet our goal of 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces and attributable copper production of between 190 million and 220 million pounds. We're also maintaining our outlook for costs. Despite upward pressure from assumption changes we made in respect of the gold price, the Aussie dollar exchange rate and the oil price, which are key drivers of our costs. So we had a very good first half, maintaining cost pressures, and we think we're on line to deliver for the balance of the year. Focusing on Q2 operating costs, we did see pressure from a weaker U.S. dollar and higher labor commodity and royalty costs, partially offset by higher by-product credits. As expected, our second quarter costs applicable to sales of gold are towards the higher end of our annual outlook due to a combination of scheduled roaster maintenance in Nevada, which required a shutdown of approximately 30 days, and processing of lower grades in Nevada as a function of mine sequencing and the final remediation of the Gold Quarry slide that occurred in December 2009. Copper cost applicable to sales for the second quarter were higher than last year as expected due to higher waste stripping related to Phase 6 at Batu Hijau and an extended mill maintenance shutdown at Batu. In order to provide better comparability with our peers, last quarter, we also began reporting costs applicable to sales on an attributable and net attributable basis. Second quarter costs applicable to sales on a net attributable basis were just under $500 an ounce. Slide 5 highlights some of the key financial metrics for the quarter. Revenue of $2.4 billion was 11% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven by higher realized gold and copper prices. In respect of earnings, we had another strong quarter, generating net income attributable to shareholders and continuing operations of $523 million or $1.06 a share, up from $382 million or $0.78 a share for the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, we closed on the Fronteer acquisition and expensed transaction costs of approximately $20 million. In addition, during the quarter, we incurred a copper provisional pricing mark-to-market loss of approximately $16 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had 84 million pounds of copper provisioning priced at $4.22 a pound. It is interesting to note that if you look at quarterly adjusted net income over the past 3 years, you will see that we have a distinct seasonality effect to our numbers, with the second quarter approximately 15% weaker than the other 3 quarters due to a combination of factors, some of which are covered above. And while we don't run the business on a quarterly basis, we will try to do a better job providing quarterly direction in respect to production since in the absence thereof, the quarterly expectations become the annual guidance divided by 4, which is not how the regions perform. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $414 million after an Indonesian tax payment of approximately $300 million for the 2010 year. Operating cash flow was also impacted by a timing issue related to concentrate shipments that occurred right before quarter-end, for which provisional payments are only received in early Q3. For the first half of the year, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, and if current metal prices continue, I expect we will deliver very strong operating cash flow and earnings in the second half of the year. Finally, bottom line earnings were negatively impacted by an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $136 million related to the finalization of litigation related to our royalty on the Holt mine, currently operated by St. Andrew Goldfields. The St. Andrew royalty and our obligation to pay the sliding scale royalty is a legacy of the former Newmont capital business that we divested at the end of 2007. We previously announced details of the expected charge for this quarter in an 8-K filing on July 15. On Slide 6, you will see the significant gold margin expansion experienced over the past 10 quarters, with a 90% increase in margin on a 66% increase in gold price. It is this margin expansion on current attributable production in excess of 5 million ounces that enables us to fund a truly unique combination of aggressive internal growth, increased investment for the long term through exploration and the ability to return additional capital to shareholders. Slide 7 provides evidence of our commitment to returning additional capital to shareholders, and you'll see a 200% increase in dividends over the past 6 quarters. On Wednesday this week, in line with our stated gold price-linked dividend policy, the board approved a $0.30 per share dividend payable for the third quarter, payable on September 29 to shareholders of record on September 28. As Richard mentioned, the yield of the current stock price is an excess of 2%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our regional operating performance in a little more detail.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Russell. An overview of Q2 results by region can be found on Slide 8, with a view of performance versus the prior year quarter. Russell detailed the key production variances from the quarter in his remarks, and full variance explanations on our year-over-year performance can be found in this morning's release or in our 10-Q. For the current discussion, I'd like to focus my remarks on relevant updates from each of our 4 operating regions. Turning to Slide 9, our North American Q2 results were down slightly from last year's second quarter due to mine sequencing at Leeville and the temporary suspension of mining at Chukar, which was partially offset by the initiation of mining at Exodus. As you can see in the picture, in July, we completed remediation work at Gold Quarry, and we have recently recommenced mining ore from the pit. There is significant development activity underway throughout our Nevada operations, including Exodus, which is an underground refractory deposit that commenced commercial production in May and is expected to produce about 65,000 to 75,000 ounces per year for at least 5 years and provide a platform for further underground exploration. Emigrant is the near-surface oxide leach deposit which is anticipated to be begin production in 2012 at about 80,000 ounces per year, while Pete Bajo, another underground refractory deposit which delivered its first ounces in July, is expected to produce 60,000 to 70,000 ounces in 2012 and will also provide underground exploration access between Pete and Carlin East. At Twin Creeks, we are expecting regulatory approval to initiate mining of the Vista 7 layback later this year. Approximately 600,000 ounces in total are expected to be mined from this deposit over the next 4 to 5 years. At our Phoenix operation, we continue to see opportunities for increasing production. We are permitting and preparing to construct the copper leach project, which should add 20 million to 25 million pounds of copper production per year beginning in the second half of 2013, and we are studying options for a second mill, which would substantially increase in-excess copper and gold production. At Long Canyon, drilling is focused on in-fill, mineralized extensions and district exploration, and our extension drilling program continues to highlight growth potential. In Mexico, construction of the Noche Buena mine in La Herradura is progressing according to schedule. We are also supporting our partner as they consider developing a gold mill that will have a capacity of 8,000 tons per day and could result in an average additional gold production of 60,000 ounces per year on a consolidated basis. Moving to Slide 10, South American production was up over the prior year due to the contribution of the new La Zanja mine in Peru, partially offset by lower leach placement at Yanacocha. On the development front, we have re-sequenced the mine plant at Yanacocha to deal with geotechnical and paleosol issues at La Quinua. And as previously announced this week, our board approved the Conga project, which Guy will speak to in more detail in a moment. Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 11, regional volumes and costs in the second quarter were impacted by the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. At Boddington, production was ahead of budget at 205,000 ounces of gold for the quarter, and optimization study is advancing. CAS was slightly higher than planned in Q2 related to a conveyor belt maintenance at Boddington. However, we are still on track to meet our guidance range of $580 to $620 per ounce. This region is making good progress in achieving its strategic planned goals and is moving forward with the Tanami Shaft project after this week's board approval. In Indonesia,PTNNT signed a memorandum of understanding allowing resumption of exploration activity at Elang and at other locations in eastern Indonesia. At Elang, we are reestablishing the exploration camp in advance of initiating our drilling program later this year. I'll wrap up the regional discussion on Slide 12 with Africa. While Richard mentioned future milestones to growth, I'd like to recognize the significant milestone in our African region. On July 18, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our first full gold core at Ahafo. In its short history, our Ahafo operations have become the base for the fastest-growing region in our portfolio. So far, Newmont Ghana gold has safely produced almost 2.5 million ounces, contributing significantly to the overall value of our company since 2006. In addition to job creation, many community development projects have come to the area due in part to Newmont's social investments, including programs dealing with malaria treatment and prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness and education and community infrastructure projects. Ahafo demonstrated another strong quarter of gold production growth due to higher grades and recoveries at the Apensu and Amoma pits. Recent development activities include a successful public hearing with respect to our Subika underground project, which paves the way for advancement towards issuance of the production permit, while construction is well underway at Akyem after our Board of Directors approved the project in March, 2011. Both of these projects are important contributors to our growth plan. I'll now turn the call over to Guy Lansdown, who will speak to the recent board approvals for Conga and the Tanami Shaft.
Guy Lansdown: Thanks, Brian. On to Slide 13. Earlier this week, we announced that the Conga and Tanami Shaft projects received full funds approval from our board. Collectively, these projects are major steps towards achieving our goal of growing to 7 million ounces of gold production by 2017. I'd like to shed some additional light on those projects. On Slide 14, you'll see a picture of the drilling activity at our Conga project in Peru. Conga's size and quality of its current reserves and NRM make it one of the premier gold and copper mining projects in the world. In addition, we have established relationships with the local communities and an experienced base of employees and stakeholders. Furthermore, Conga provides a bridge to the future of Yanacocha, allowing time for the potential development of the sulfidic and underground opportunities and continued exploration exposure on our 300,000-hectare land package. Conga will also provide a strategic advantage to develop potential surrounding opportunities with our construction of the first copper concentrator in the region. We're planning for near-term production of 300,000 to 350,000 ounces of gold and 80 million to 120 million pounds of copper per year at cash costs of $400 to $450 per ounce and $1.25 to $1.75 per pound. Capital spending attributable to Newmont is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.4 billion. This is an increase of our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. The cost increases are as a result of scope developments, estimate refinement, as well as Forex and escalation. We have a great team on board and ready to execute the projects under the leadership of Pol Guzman, who will serve as our Project Director. Pol has tremendous experience and a great track record of successfully delivering large projects around the globe and, in particular, in South America, where he successfully delivered the Escondida and Antamina projects on time and under budget. On Slide 15, we provided an update on the Tanami Shaft project in Australia, which also received board approval on Wednesday. The shaft will increase Newmont's gold production from the Callie underground mine at Tanami to greater than 340,000 ounces per year in a sustainable, profitable and responsible manner. We expect it has the potential to increase the resource through reduced cutoff grades and improved access at depth. The shaft will also reduce our CAS by around $100 per ounce by increasing efficiency. It will strategically position Newmont to potentially expand existing mine reserves through access to the ore and orebody and other exploration targets while leveraging off Newmont's existing position at the Tanami, including existing infrastructure and positive relationships with regulators and traditional owners. We're encouraged by Wednesday's board approval of the Conga and Tanami projects, and we hope to bring more projects through the development pipeline over the next several quarters. Richard?
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Guy. So to summarize, Newmont continues to execute on both our operations and development plans, and we continue to deliver solid results. We're advancing our growth plan across our portfolio with 2 key project approvals announced this week. We're maintaining our outlook for 2011 production, CAS and capital spending. We've increased our dividend over 200% over the second quarter of 2010 dividend, enhancing our shareholders' exposure to the rallying gold price. We now have the highest return of capital through our gold price-linked dividend than any gold company in this space. And notably, based on an ROIC measure, we have the highest return on capital as well. We've heard your feedback that you'd like more information on project updates and milestones, and hopefully, some of today's materials were accepted in that regard with respect to responding to that feedback, and we will communicate periodic updates as is practicable on all of our growth projects going forward. So with that, I want to thank you for listening to our call. And operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Bridges, JP Morgan Chase.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just wanted to look at Conga. Obviously, CapEx escalation has become a big topic. Just wondered how much of your current budget is solid now and locked in?
Guy Lansdown: John, this is Guy. John, we've locked in a substantial amount of our major equipments. We've placed orders for those last year, so the bulk of that, which would be tens of millions of dollars, is locked in. In addition, we've got our earthworks contractor onboard and ready to go. We've got our EPCM contractor onboard and ready to go. I guess the bulk of the work to come is -- or the costs to come are around the bulk materials and, of course, the construction contracts.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So percentage-wise, how much is locked in? How much is still open to further inflation?
Guy Lansdown: John, we'd guess -- estimate at the order of 20% to 30% of our costs would be locked in at this stage.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, that's helpful. It's interesting, the timing of the decision to go ahead with the developments in Peru. I just wondered if you could make some comments about your comfort with what's going on down there.
Richard O'Brien: John, it's Richard. I would just say that this is a company which has been in Peru for a very long period of time. We have undergone several changes of not just presidents but political styles, from revolutionary through left- and right-leaning. And I think as we look into the future, this company -- this asset, based on reserves today, will be producing, I believe, 20 to 30 years Conga, not to mention Yanacocha, we believe will have a second life as we get into sulfide ores. And with all that, we expect that we will see political changes in Peru, just like we do everywhere else around the world. I would say specifically, with respect to the change of presidents in Peru, one, it's always, I think, good to note that in any country in the world, where changes happen in a democracy and things go without really any revolution or anything to go with that, Peru certainly qualifies for that. I think people in Peru pride the vote that they get, and they use it appropriately. I hope that President Humala will be a president who values the contribution of business in general and mining in particular. And at this point, I think given the ministerial staff that he has selected, I think he is looking for experienced individuals who will help guide the government of Peru in exactly the same direction that it's been driven. And I think what we could expect is to see some ongoing thoughts and discussions around how best to close the gap between rich and poor and better share some of the wealth of Peru. And I think we're all for that, done in the right way. And so far, what I would tell you is we expect, just as when President Garcia came to into office, that there will be some discussions about what we will do as mining companies on royalties. I don't expect that gold or Yanacocha and Conga will be picked on in particular. I think it will be industry-wide. And I think we have a pretty good sense of what that is, and we've incorporated that into our economics. I won't tell you what our assumption is, but we have made some assumptions. And what I'll tell you is going forward, John, we learned how to live around the world in changing political environments and will continue to do so.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Excellent. And if I might squeeze a final one in. Boddington, you've gotten throughput up to 8.9 million tons in the quarter. I just wondered if that was on soft rock or if that is something that is sustainable?
Russell Ball: No, John. That's not on any rock that's uncharacteristically soft compared to what we normally expect to see at Boddington. That's just a reflection of the plant continuing to ramp up and perform at capacity where we expect it to be.
Operator: Our next question from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: My question is, again, just following up on the CapEx inflation. And just big picture, in April, you guys announced a $7 billion CapEx plan for an incremental $3.2 million gold ounces or about $2,200 an ounce. These 2 projects, Conga and Tanami, to your account, would be about $2.6 billion for roughly 600,000 ounces of gold equivalent or around $4,333 per ounce. So I'm just trying to square how these 2 projects which represent about 40% of your next 5 years' CapEx budget will amount to 20% of incremental production. Do you expect, in the coming projects, to have significantly lower average cost per ounces, or do you think that, that $7 billion baseline that you gave in April will start to creep up just because of the new information on these projects?
Randy Engel: Jorge, it's Randy. A couple of points, there are certainly a number of projects that sit around existing infrastructure, certainly, in Nevada, that will contribute significantly, which will help bring that per ounce number down sequentially. The Conga project, being a very significant greenfield with considerable earthmoving, is certainly going to be on the higher end of that. But you'll see those 2 types of projects on both sides of the spectrum balance out. We, of course, like everyone else in the industry, are experiencing pressures, though. We're experiencing pressures around labor, input commodities, energy, and we will do our best to manage against those, but those will afflict us as they will the entire industry.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: But, I guess, in summary, are you saying that you're still comfortable with the kind of holistic $7 billion gross number that you gave in April?
Randy Engel: Well, for the time being, we're going through our plants. We're taking a look at how pressures will affect the rest of the projects, but I think it's fair to say that some of the pressures you saw on Conga and Tanami will pressure the rest of the portfolio.
Richard O'Brien: I think it's fair to say, Jorge, that in this environment, we could expect some escalation. Remember, this is a project plan which has projects going all the way out into 2017 and beyond, actually, because we do have other plans than just the ones that were included to get to the $7 billion. We do expect there will be escalation pressures. We also expect that at times, there won't be. So I think this is a longer-term view for us. I would also say that when we look at these projects, we are trying to do so in the light of ensuring that we incorporate today's environment into the numbers that we give you with respect to projects which are approved. So these are obviously further along in the maturation process, now moving into Stage 5 for us than some of the others which are earlier on. And as we announced about those, we'll tell you exactly what those will be as well.
Russell Ball: It's Russ. Just let me add a comment because it's specific to the Tanami investment. If you look at that with the exchange rate moving from $0.95 to $1.10, that added $40 million in capital to that project. So as Richard says, as we go in to execute, we will take our assumptions and update them for the best information that we have at the time, and we'll give you that. But we had an additional capital expense of about $40 million just solely related to FX, and that's been in the last 3 months.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: And I guess what I'm trying to get at is what's the offset in your thinking on these projects? Like Conga, for example, roughly, I think you tucked in about by 20% the expected attributable gold. The cost went up by 50%. But are you now expecting a much higher longer-term gold price or lower OpEx in the out years as the offset to that? Has something changed in your thinking, or are you maybe on some projects reaching the point where you'll actually say no because of this kind of cost inflation we're seeing?
Randy Engel: No, Jorge, with the portfolio that we discussed at Investor Day, the gold prices that we're seeing in the current environment certainly would allow for us to move forward on the vast majority of those as profitable projects. But again, as Russell echoed, we will continually come back to the street and share with you any inflationary pressures that we're experiencing, and we'll let you know as we go.
Richard O'Brien: Just to conclude, I would say everyone of these projects goes through a screen, obviously, its strategic importance, economic returns, and we don't shy away from balancing those, but generally, we continue to see these projects even at prices lower than a $1,500 gold price. We definitely see that these projects are economic, clearly exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. And as with Conga, if you do the net on production cost as both cost for gold and cost for copper and you look at the revenue stream, I think a lot of companies would tell you that they're producing gold for free, the way this comes out. So I think when we look at the cash flow returns on this and we look at the near-term payback, these are just the kind of projects that we ought to do. And more over, we're basing that on what we know today in terms of reserve and resource base. And having the first copper concentrator in the district, we know there's going to be more. So are we willing to pay up a little bit for the option? Absolutely. We think it's the right thing to do.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: It's good to see that you have stuck with your guidance for the year, although it does suggest quite a bit of extra lifting on your part in the second half, particularly at Nevada. Can you give us a bit of an outline as to what your plan is there to lift that production in second half?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, David, Brian will do that. Let me just say I think the team in Nevada has absolutely a great plan that they've got in place -- they've had in place. We're, as far as we're concerned, on budget for Nevada. We get your angst, and Brian will talk about it.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Richard. I guess there's a few things going on in Nevada which are giving us some confidence for production in the second half. First, we're going to have significantly more roaster days coming into the second half of the year after the shutdown. We're also going to see some significantly higher-grade material getting delivered into the plants. With the Gold Quarry slide being remediated, we're going to be back into the higher-grade ore in the bottom of Gold Quarry for the second half of the year. We're also going to see higher grades coming out of Twin Creeks as we go deeper. The other 2 areas where we're also going to see production coming in higher -- I already did mention was with the startup of Pete Bajo and Exodus in Q2, we'll see those underground operations ramping up over the second half of the year. So we're probably going to see in the order of 25%, 30% increase in production coming out in Nevada over the second half of the year for roughly around the same global total cost. So not only are we going to see the ounces go up, which should bring us into the guidance range, but we're also going to see our CAS come down over the second half of the year as well.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: On a similar vein, Boddington, also a faster or higher production rate in the second half compared to the first half. Is that mostly driven by grade, or do you have some throughput expectations there as well?
Brian Hill: A combination of both actually, David. The throughput's been very good, running at capacity. We're also seeing grade reconciliation, which is essentially lining up with what our model has expected. So I'd like to say we're going to see similar quarters in 3 and 4 that we've seen in Q2.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. With regard to the throughput being over 8 million tons for the quarter?
Brian Hill: That's our expectation, yes.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Similar kind of question but this time on capital. It looks like the spend rate in Africa, really, at both Ahafo and Akyem looks low compared to your guidance. Do you have a big spend expected in the second half, or would we see some of that split into next year? And what does that mean for the delivery of those projects?
Russell Ball: David, it's Russ here. Likely, we will see some of it slip over. I mean, the full cost we received shows that it's largely catching up by the end of the year. But we continue to manage that. From our perspective, no implication on the second point of your question, which was around the expected startup date. Kim and the team, they're doing an outstanding job, and my expectation is that they'll come in under budget ahead of schedule, but it's still early. They're a very good team, and they're executing. So on issue from a spend perspective. I'd say we do have some irrational exuberance around our ability to spend capital, so what you end up seeing towards the end of the year is some of that capital shifts into the following year.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Without any delay to delivery?
Russell Ball: Correct.
Richard O'Brien: I'd just say on Akyem, we were just out there a couple of weeks ago. They are beginning to pour first concrete out there. We have this project over 95% engineered. When they're in the dirt, this thing is going to go like heck. We preordered some equipment, remembering that this mill has actually been on-site at Ahafo for quite some time. I think we're ready to get going on this thing, so I expect this project, as Russ said, this one will hit the straps in terms of its budget and its delivery dates.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. At Batu, sell-down is behind you. Do you expect an inflow of cash as a result of that?
Russell Ball: David, Russ. Just to clarify, we entered into the agreement with PIP, an arm of the Indonesian government, on May 6. That transaction has not closed, so our ownership interest has not changed. We're still at the 48.5%, and we still continue to work to close that transaction on the final 7% of divestiture. But you need to remember that those funds will go to existing shareholders, so it's a secondary, in effect, versus additional capital going into PTNNT. What we did complete in the quarter was a $600 million non-recourse to the sponsors' financing at the PTNNT level, and that provides that entity with significant capital flexibility to fund ongoing operating and capital costs as we continue to evaluate our third sag and then starting to spend on the Elang project, which we've spoken to you in a small amount of detail. But we're hoping to progress that. So you won't see additional capital going in, but you should rest assured that they have the balance sheet underneath them at the subsidiary level.
Richard O'Brien: Just to add to that, David, when we signed the agreement with PIP, we knew it would take some time to get government approval, so we actually have, I think, until November, mid-November, to complete the transaction. And the expectation is that they would pay cash to the foreign shareholders for that piece, and that, as Russ was saying, would come out of PTNNT directly to the foreign shareholders.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Final question, Yanacocha grade over the last couple of quarters and this one as well has been quite strong. Can you expect those kind of grade levels going forward?
Russell Ball: David, we've had some positive grade reconciliation coming out of Yanacocha in the first 2 quarters of this year. It's probably not going to be as strong as we look over the balance of this year. One of the issues that, as I mentioned, we've had to do is just some of the mine sequencing readjustment with some of the geotechnical issues that we've seen at La Quinua, along the north wall, towards the latter end of the year. The one item that we could get some grade bumps on would relate to getting back into the bottom of El Tapado, where we've typically seen the higher grade ores that we deliver to the mill. But a lot of that is going to be contingent on geotechnical stability as we bring the north wall down at La Quinua.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And also, the stacking rates appear to be coming off compared to where they've been previously. Should we be thinking about the current Conga stacking rates going forward?
Russell Ball: Well, that stacking rate was coming off because of some of these issues with La Quinua and the stability. We've had to move more waste as opposed to get the ores stacked onto the pads. So as we get back that area under control with a proper geotechnical program, we should probably see some of the stacking rates come back up.
Richard O'Brien: I could just try to maybe connect the dots between the stacking rates and the higher grade, I mean, just come back from Yanacocha. What we see down there, and this is, I think, a tribute to how Newmont's doing projects today and turning them over to operations, but we built that gold mill for about 5 million tons of throughput a year. And it looks like this year, we'll be close to 6 million tons. And I think with that, we're going to really see the capability there to continue to produce out of the mill a lot more than we'd anticipated.
Operator: Our next question from Patrick Chidley, HSBC.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Just a couple of questions. First, I just want to drill down on some of the detail of the Conga project as it is now because there have been a number of changes. Now you mentioned the scope change, but it looked as if the production level has actually gone down. I'm wondering if the throughput rate is still around 95,000 tons and what the difference is in terms of why the gold production rate's gone down.
Guy Lansdown: Patrick, this is Guy. We've updated our models, Patrick, to include the latest drill results, the latest metallurgical test results, so we've got a new mine plan. And we've incorporated our best estimates based on our lessons learned from other projects around what we forecast the production to be. It has increased the overall production and the mine life. The mine life's actually gone up a year or so. We do believe there is some upsides around the current projections that we have, but the bulk of it is really an update to the mine plan.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: So would that be basically planning for lower grades than you previously did in the first 5 years?
Guy Lansdown: What we do is we drive the mine plan around a revenue model, so we're not necessarily targeting higher copper or gold production. And with our current metal price assumptions, this is where we land up. The copper price -- sorry, the copper production is about where we had anticipated before, gold, slightly lower, so using slightly higher gold prices would drop the gold production but increase mine life.
Richard O'Brien: And I would just add to that, Patrick, that one of the things we've tried to do, as Guy said, based on lessons learned, we've done quite a bit more infill drilling than we have at other projects in this stage. I think we know more about the grade as well as the quality of concentrate that we're going to produce out of this. And I think Brian and his team have been working closely with Guy and the construction team to ensure a clean handoff of construction into operations. And I think it's great that at this point in the model, we've actually got more detail than we had, for instance, at Boddington. I think we're starting to scope this plan out so that we have a much higher level of confidence of actually delivering this production rate.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Right. And the production throughput rate is still the same, 95,000 tons a day?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that's right, Patrick. We still got the same throughput rate.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Okay. And you mentioned a strip ratio of between 1 and 1.5. Is there any sort of a timing on that, I mean, in terms of the schedule? Is it going to be lower in the early years or higher in the early years?
Guy Lansdown: That's just a pretty good average. I can try and get you more details down the road, but this is a pretty good average strip ratio.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Okay. And then on Conga, you've been already spending quite a lot of money, I think over $300 million in the last 2 quarters. Is that included, what's been spent in the latest update of $4.5 billion?
Guy Lansdown: Yes. The numbers through the start of the year are included in the capital projections.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Okay, that's included now. And what else do I have? You mentioned that you got one of the highest returns on invested capital. I wonder if you -- what that would be, I guess, on an annualized basis?
Russell Ball: Patrick, it's Russ. It's 12 for us if you go back and look at the last 3, 4 years, and we have an interesting slide I was going to show, but we just ran out of time. I'll get John to put it on the website, and he can share that with you. It shows our return on invested capital against our peers, and it's not a metric a lot of people have historically spent a lot of time on in this space, but we think it's an important metric, and it's one we are watching closely.
Operator: Our final question comes from Brian MacArthur, UBS Securities.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank: I just want to follow up a little bit on the last question because maybe you can answer the question this way. Obviously, if we take the low-end, Conga's production is down about 20% on the gold, copper's flat. And I realize the range is higher. Costs are up at both. And you mentioned some of that updated data which is grade. Some of it is different assumptions. Some of it is maybe just, as you said, making sure it delivers. Can you tell me how much they change your NPV? Because obviously, we've taken out 0.5 million ounces at the low end over the first 5 years, which is significant with the capital going up, and you're still saying it's good project and I get that. But the economics must have changed a little bit if you're going to bring the gold production down that much. Is it really great, as Patrick said, as half of it, and the rest is offset by price assumptions? Or just can you flush that out a little bit more, please?
Randy Engel: Brian, it's Randy. Rough rule of thumb, you're going to see about a 1% change in your rate of return for about a 10% change in the CapEx. And for about a 5% change in your production profile, and I'm talking all straight lines, so these are very rough rules of thumb, you're going to see about a 1% change in the rate of return.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank: So that's -- exactly. Is this fairly straight line in the first 5 years when you give these averages, or does it move around a fair bit?
Randy Engel: Reasonably straight line.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, that helped. And second question, just a bit of an argument, though. Reclamation was $43 million this year, which I know that's going to hop around over time. Is there anything special in that? That doesn't look like that's a run rate going forward, or that was up a fair bit versus history?
Russell Ball: Yes, Brian, I'm not sure special is the word I'd use. We took a $30 million charge related to Dawn Mining. And there's a fair bit of disclosure in there. We are very close to a settlement on that with the federal government, and that's our best estimate. You'll see an incremental $30 million there, and there was $4 million related to some in perpetuity water treatment at another project. So yes, clearly not our run rate and not something I would expect to see going forward.
Operator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO.
Richard O'Brien: Okay, thanks for your questions and your attendance today, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Newmont Mining First Quarter and Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2011 earnings call. With me today are the members of our executive leadership team. They will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2, as we will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be filed -- sorry, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. First of all, I want to thank all of you who attended our Investor Day two weeks ago, either in person or via the webcast. We've got a lot of positive and constructive feedback from the investment community on our approach to deliver growth with good returns. Specifically at Investor Day, we announced plans to grow from our current outlook of 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces of gold production for 2011 to approximately 7 million ounces of annual production by 2017. And that is a 35% growth net of decline, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders to enhance their exposure to gold price. We've also heard that you want more color on our gold price link dividend and on the timing of our production from our projects and our growth plan. We plan on covering both of those in our call today. In addition to that, we'll provide highlights for our first quarter results. And our first quarter results were very solid with the benefit of robust gold and copper price environment, combined with strong operating results. We continue to have a rock-solid balance sheet and the potential to generate significant additional cash flow. This, combined with the commitment and enthusiasm of our workforce across the globe, gives me confidence that we will deliver on our growth plan.  And now to recap our first quarter performance, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Russell Ball.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Turning to Slide 4. As you can see, we had another strong quarter due to a combination of our continued focus on safe execution and delivery and strong metal prices, gold in particular.  A few highlights from the quarter. We realized an average gold price of $1,382 an ounce, and while the record is approximately $115 below current spot prices. We generated record operating cash flow of almost $1 billion, a 36% increase over last year on a 25% increase in gold price. It is clear to me that the company-wide focus on operational execution and delivery is being driven to the bottom line in an environment of expanding margins, as reflected in the operating cash flow for the quarter. Attributable gold production was 1.3 million ounces, slightly the same as [ph] last year and slightly ahead of our budget for the first quarter. Attributable copper production decreased to 57 million pounds driven by lower production at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, as we strip for Phase 6 and process lower-grade stockpiles. We should access Phase 6 ore in late 2013. Copper production was, however, ahead of budget for the quarter.  As far as the bottom line, there was essentially no difference between reported net income and our adjusted net income figures shown on the slide of $513 million or $1.04 a share, a really clean quarter from an income statement perspective.  Continuing on Slide 5, revenue for the quarter was up 10% to $2.5 billion. On the cost side, cost applicable to sales were up 17% and 42%, respectively, with higher copper operating cost driven by lower production at Batu Hijau, as previously mentioned. On gold operating costs. Starting this quarter, we have added 2 non-GAAP metrics that we think will provide investors with a different perspective on our cost structure and one likely more comparable to our peers. The first is attributable to CAS, which represents the operating cost per ounce for Newmont's attributable gold ounces produced. So we eliminate the ounces in cost that are included in our consolidated financial statements that are ultimately for the account of the noncontrolling shareholders largely, again, at Yanacocha and Batu Hijau. Attributable CAS for the quarter was $562 an ounce or roughly $5 an ounce higher than the consolidated CAS number that historically we have reported. The second is net attributable CAS, where we take the attributable CAS number that I just covered and then treat our copper co-product revenue as a credit to operating costs. Net attributable CAS for the quarter was $438 an ounce. As I said, both of these are non-GAAP measures, but I believe they are important for investors to understand, particularly when comparing costs across the sector. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is provided in the appendix on Slides 24 and 25. One last point on costs. I would like to remind you that we will continue to report U.S. GAAP operating costs, which result in us being required to expense significant more cost than we would under FRS accounting. Our estimate for 2011 is in the order of about $40 an ounce.  Moving to Slide 6. We've included the GFMS 2010 industry cost drivers to provide some additional perspective on industrywide costs. From 2009 to 2010, average cash costs increased 17%, driven by the factors highlighted on the chart. I would submit that the cost drivers for 2011 are not going to be too much different from what you see here, and I think we will be looking at industrywide operating costs of around $650 an ounce for 2011. Interestingly, our first quarter CAS of $557 an ounce is equal to the industry average for last year. I have no doubt that our relative position on the cost curve will improve in 2011.  Moving to Slide 7. Our gold operating margin continues to expand at a greater rate than the gold price. I like what we saw in the early years of this bull market when operating and capital cost increases outran the globe price. If you take the midpoint of our cost guidance for 2011 and the current spot price of gold, you will see continued margin expansion likely for the balance of the year.  Turning to Slide 8. As mentioned previously, strong operating cash flow for the quarter, combined with a strong balance sheet at the beginning of the year, resulted in a liquidity picture reflected on the right-hand side of the slide. On a consolidated basis, we reported $4.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.8 billion in marketable securities and ongoing capacity of approximately $1.8 billion under our corporate revolver. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the acquisition of Fronteer Gold and utilized approximately $2.25 billion in cash, which left us with still an excess of $2 billion on the balance sheet. I will talk about returning additional cash to shareholders shortly, but first, a few thoughts on gold with spot prices nearing an all-time high, at least on a nominal basis. I've included on Slide 9 Martin Murenbeeld's most recent summary slides on the gold market. For those who don't subscribe to Martin's work, I really believe you're missing out on the most complete and accurate coverage of the gold market.  For some history, Martin hasn't always been bullish on gold, and in fact, he was very bearish in late '90s as produced as hedged, central banks sold and the U.S. dollar range to premium. Martin turned bullish in 2001. And for those who haven't been following his work, he's been uncannily accurate in his forecast since then. You can see Martin's bullish and bearish arguments for gold on the slide. And I won't go into them in any detail, as we clearly don't have time on this call. In short, Martin remains bullish and has the probability weighted forecast of $1,546 for the end of 2011 and an average price of $1,573 for 2012. Although as you can see on the bottom of the slide, he does make a point that he makes no allowances for geopolitics in his forecast. On the Slide 10, you will see GFMS's forecast for 2011, albeit with a slightly less bullish average of $1,455, but interestingly, a very wide range of up to $1,620 an ounce. Finally, I've included a quote from Dennis Gartman's research note from Tuesday this week. I think it very succinctly sums up the current gold market, where Dennis notes that gold trade is no longer a commodity but as a currency. We concur, we are bullish, and as outlined in our Investor Day in New York on April 7, we are going to invest accordingly.  At that same Analyst Day, we announced our gold price link dividend, which is summarized on Slide 11. In short, we believe that we have an obligation to share this significant cash flow we are generating with the owners of the company, and that is what we intend to do starting with the gold price link dividend. Subject, of course, to regular quarterly board approval, starting with the second quarter dividend, shareholders will receive an annual dividend that increases by $0.20 for every $100 increase in our net realized gold price for the trailing quarter. To take the second quarter dividend as an example, we realized $1,382 an ounce, which corresponds to an $0.80 annual dividend on the chart that you see on this slide. So we will be paying a $0.20 quarterly dividend on June 29. This represents a 33% increase over the first quarter dividend and 100% increase over the year-ago dividend.  Looking ahead, it's very likely that our net realized price for Q2 will be towards the high end of the $1,400 to $1,499 bucket, which should equate to an annual dollar rate -- annual dividend of $0.25 for the third quarter dividend payment. This would represent 1/3 of 25% increase. As we have said before, having the financial strength and flexibility we have allows us to both aggressively grow the business and return capital to shareholders. With a bullish view on our own internal opportunities and the gold price, we will continue to look at further alternatives to return additional cash to shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Brian, who will cover the operational performance for the quarter.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Russell. We summarized our regional operating performance on the Slide 12, and year-over-year growth production was essentially unchanged at 1.3 million ounces, with higher contributions from our Africa region. They were offset by lower production from South America, while North America and APAC production was essentially flat.  Consolidated costs applicable to sales were 17% higher than last year due to lower production in South America, as well as higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs in North America. And as Russell mentioned a few minutes ago, this is generally in line with our industry as a whole. Commencing our regional discussion on Slide 13 with North America, you'll see a recent picture of the gold quarry area in Nevada where remediation from the slide that took place in December 2009 is nearing completion. Over 40 million tons of alluvium and bedrock have been removed, and all of the equipment that was trapped by the slide has been safely recovered. We are currently mining fresh ore feed for Mill 5, and approximately 50% of the ore going to Mill 5 is direct from gold quarry.  Turning to first quarter results. Attributable gold production in North America was 482,000 ounces, up 2% over last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher leach placement at the Soledad-Dipolos pit at La Herradura in Mexico. Gold ounces produced in Nevada were virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010, as higher mill production from underground sources was offset by a lower leach placement due to mine sequencing.  North American costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 7% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to higher waste mining, milling and diesel costs, and lower leach production in Nevada. This was partially offset by higher copper and silver byproduct credits. Newmont continues to expect full year North American gold production of 1.98 to 2.1 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $560 to $600 an ounce. Moving to Slide 14. Attributable gold production during the first quarter in South America region at Yanacocha in Peru was 160,000 ounces. This included 148,000 ounces from Yanacocha and 12,000 ounces from La Zanja. Gold production in South America decreased 26% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower leach placement, mill grade and transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua. Costs applicable to sales per ounce were $583 per ounce, an increase of 57% in the first quarter of 2011 from 2010 due to lower production, higher labor costs that was partially offset by lower workers' participation costs and higher byproduct credits. Newmont continue to expect 2011 attributable gold production in South America between 715,000 and 775,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $500 and $550 per ounce.  Turning to our Asia-Pacific region on Slide 15. Attributable gold production was 514,000 ounces, down 1.5% from the prior-year quarter, while copper production was 57 million pounds, down 37% from Q1 2010. The biggest driver of the change in gold and copper production -- sorry, in Indonesia, where we are currently processing from stockpile while the Phase 6 stripping campaign is under way.  At our Boddington mine in Australia, we had a solid quarter despite 8 days of downtime due to a conveyor belt failure. Had we not experienced that unplanned event, production at Boddington would've been ahead of budget for the quarter. As the picture at right depicts, Boddington recently posted its 1 million pounds of gold production.  Our Asia-Pacific region reported gold costs applicable to sales of $527 per ounce, up 15% over last year's Q1 and copper costs applicable to sales of $1.11 per pound, up 42%. Costs were impacted by the lower Batu Hijau production, as well as attributable gold production -- sorry, increase over last -- Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production in the Asia-Pacific region of between 1.86 and 1.99 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $600 and $675 per ounce. We also expect 2011 attributable copper production of 190 to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of $1.25 to $1.50 per pound. Regarding divestiture activity at Batu Hijau, Newmont's economic ownership currently remains at 48.5%. The Indonesian government has recently designated an agency of the Ministry of Finance as the entity that will buy the final 7% stake. On April 18, 2011, our subsidiary and the agency reached an agreement to finalize the terms for the purchase and sale, which is anticipated to occur by mid-2011.  On to Slide 16. In Africa, Newmont's biggest growth region, our Ahafo mine delivered attributable gold production of 186,000 ounces in Q1, which was a 55% increase over last year's first quarter due to higher mill grade and recovery as a result of mine sequencing. The higher gold production at Africa also had a favorable impact on costs applicable to sales, which were $451 per ounce in Q1, a reduction of 17% that was partially offset by higher diesel and royalty costs. Newmont continues to expect 2011 attributable gold production at Ahafo of between 550,000 and 590,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $485 to $535 per ounce.  I'll now turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Brian. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, we'd like to provide some additional detail on the growth plan that we announced in our recent Investor Day. First, I'll recap our growth strategy on Slide 17. As shown, we plan to grow 35% to about 7 million ounces of attributable gold production by 2017 from a base of our current outlook of 5.1 of 5.3 million ounces of gold for 2011. In order to get to that 7 million ounce run rate in 2017, we need to bring about 3.2 million ounces of incremental production online over the next few years to offset the decline in the balance of our portfolio. Our growth will be faced in, with about 20% of our new growth reflected in production by 2013, 50% by 2015 and the balance expected to be in production by 2017. On Slide 18, we've added some additional color to the timing of that incremental production by breaking down our growth profile by project. I've noted that several analysts have already got this fairly close, and so we're providing some information that some of you may not need, but in the interest of clarity, we're going to give it to everybody in this format.  The sequence begins with the Subika and Nevada expansions where development is advancing, and it goes all the way through the commencement of production at Long Canyon, which we expect, as shown on this slide, in 2017. If you'd like to reference this growth plan against our potential decline, we would direct you to the detailed regional waterfall that we provided in our Investor Day where we gave the regional decline for each of our operations. As we previously told you, 5.1 to 5.3 million ounces is our current base, and we expect the next couple of years to be essentially stable until we get back into higher-grade ore in Phase 6, as Russ mentioned, beginning in 2013, late and then moving into higher grade into 2014 and 2015. At that time, we'll also see the benefits of our new expansion projects, as shown on this slide. The numbers to the left of each represent the initial development capital of each of those projects. This view of our growth plan should allow investors to better understand that we have a fairly solid arc of production growth ahead of us.  Moving on to Slide 19. We show our operating cost for these new projects, and you'll note that we plotted them against the GFMS 2010 cost curve. Our forecast are based on what we know today about our projects, and they are unescalated. We're referencing our cost to the GFMS industry cost curve as a reminder that our actual cost will vary from our projections but that we believe the relative position of our projects should remain consistent within their replacement on the industry cost curve as it moves over time.  You'll see that our projects span the first of 4 quartiles, reflecting the diversity of our operations. You'll also notice that the companywide CAS we reported today for the first quarter fall squarely near the 2010 industry midpoint for costs, which is in line with our prior guidance. As Russell mentioned, we continue to focus on our execution to ensure that we protect our margins into the future.  So to summarize on Slide 20. We believe that Newmont offers a unique combination of production growth, project returns, reserves and exploration upside, balance sheet strength, continued operational execution and the industry's first and only gold price link dividend.  With that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Bridges, JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Many thanks for the information, especially Slide 18. That makes life a whole lot easier. Wish I could run my model of that. Just wondered, the higher grades in Africa at Ahafo, can you give us a little bit more color that and how confident you are that you're only going to make your current guidance there?
Brian Hill: John, it's Brian. Towards the end of last year, with some of the mine sequencing changes we made, we stockpiled some fairly higher-grade ore coming out of Apensu. So in the first quarter, we actually ran that higher-grade material through the plant. And with the higher grades, we also saw some higher recovery as well. So we kind of see that as more of a one-off, which we had happened in the Ahafo. So we're still -- even though we did have quite a good quarter, we're still expecting to produce in that original guidance range by year end.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. How much flexibility do you have in the pit to go after higher grade areas, or just accelerate into Subika and sweeten up the feed that way?
Brian Hill: We have some flexibility. We don't have a lot of flexibility actually in Subika because, as you know, the portal to go underground is on the one side of the wall where we're doing all the exploration work underground. So we do have some flexibility out of Apensu and out of Awonsu. But for the balance of this year, we don't expect to see any significant changes over the last three quarters that would cause us to sort of look at the significant different production profile.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then Australia was a bit ahead of expectation as well. What's going on down there?
Brian Hill: In Australia, good results coming out of the Tanami and KCGM, and Boddington essentially performing on par. So we have seen some of the other operations perform extremely well in Australia as well. So really coming out of those two, the switch to owner-operated underground mining at the Tanami is -- we're seeing some significant positive improvement in operation there. So really coming out of Tanami and KCGM.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Excellent. Many Thanks, congratulations, and I'll get out of the way and make room for somebody else. Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John.
Operator: Next question, a question from George Topping with Stifel.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: On the Australian mines, I see cash cost go from $560 an ounce in Q1, and I think the guidance is, a midpoint, about $735. Can you give an indication of how that's going to increase through the quarters?
Russell Ball: George, sorry, I -- can you repeat the number you said for the guidance because I don't think that it's the number I was looking at. Sorry.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The guidance, $700 to $770 per ounce, other Australian/New Zealand.
Russell Ball: George, some of that will be currency. Fairly, we have a decent early dollar hedge book but it's $1.05. You're starting to see the impact of the currency on that. We could get into some more detail, maybe we can take it offline and get back to you there with some inventory movements, and we'll get some more of that. In Batu, we'll have a tougher second half of the year. We'd work through some inventory in the first quarter at least. So a number of factors moving around, largely driven by production.
Randy Engel: Just maybe comment on the numbers. It's Randy. We've got $600 to $675, is the cost guidance for the entire region. Now the CapEx guidance on the next column over there is $650 to $750. But you'll see, coming out of Australia, the highest cost figures that we quoted, $700 to $770 for other Australian/New Zealand, that's going to come from some higher cost operations, particularly at  Tanami and Jundee.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Good. That's what I was looking for. Also, I noticed on Slide 18 that the Elang isn't mentioned. Could you give us an update on how the restart of the exploration program is going there?
Guy Lansdown: Sure. This is Guy. We have just recently got the permit to start exploration at Elang. So the focus is now to reestablish camp facilities, start working with the community and then continue with drilling operations. But at the moment, that's what we're going to focus on, and that's sort of one of the project that sits in our pipeline further out in the production profile.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Okay. You have to start the exploration now?
Guy Lansdown: Yes. Correct. And we plan on starting this year with drilling.
George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Bridges with JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just follow-on. Given the big building program you've got ahead of you, are you going to get to -- be more aggressive in putting hedges on, on the currencies and oil? Just wondered what you're going to do there.
Russell Ball: John, we continue to look at that. We have a small oil book. Historically, the issue's been there around, getting the hedge accounting, so we don't have to take then off from market volatility. I'd say that we're probably going to cross the Rubicon in the not-too-distant future just taking economics on the hedges and letting the accounting move. And so we'll have to explain a little more noise on a quarterly basis. But as we look at the projects here, as we are looking at managing our costs around those projects, you will continue to see more cost-related hedging to not so much be able to pick bottoms but to reduce volatility, because we think of the end of the day, being able to reduce that volatility has values. So we will continue to look at opportunities both on the commodity, FX and interest rates side related to these projects.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Excellent. Now that makes sense. Thanks again.
Russell Ball: Thanks.
Richard O'Brien: And just for the avoidance of doubt, just underlying what Russ said, in the cost side, we do not hedge revenues. So just to be clear with anybody who didn’t understand that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the John Tumazos, John Tumazos Independent Research.
John Tumazos - Independent Research: While you have a splendid array of projects, there's an anomaly where some gold stocks haven't gone up even as the price of gold seems to make new records almost every week. Long Canyon is a very good example of a transaction close to your infrastructure. Miramar, three years ago, is maybe a good example of a transaction out of your infrastructure. But could we expect further strengthening of the project queue, that's already strong, given that it's easier to find gold on Wall Street sometimes, make [indiscernible] oil industry than to spend time on exploration, et cetera.
Richard O'Brien: John, it's Richard. What I would say is 2 things that first, as you point out, our own exploration program is increased this year. We do know that historically, and as we project in the future, we can discover at the most optimal cost per ounce on new projects through our own exploration activities. So that's the first thing that we're focused on. From time to time, though, as you point out, whether it's Miramar or Long Canyon, we will take advantage of opportunities where we see upside, and perhaps the market doesn't fully appreciate that. But I would say that not a steady diet for us, it's something that will take on from time to time. In addition, I would just remind people that we tended to look at these acquisitions in a cash format, not one where we utilized shares. So that by itself helps define how big or how much we'll do. And lastly, I would just say, with the one-off in junior stocks, I don't think that it's always cheaper to buy things on Wall Street that it is through our own exploration efforts. So it's a combination approach for us. That's what we've shown historically. That's what -- we'll stick to it.
John Tumazos - Independent Research: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from David Christie with Scotia Capital.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Just quickly on the Batu Hijau, could you give me an idea, you said you had troubles in the second half of the year there, or it's going to be lower I guess. What's a great profile for the stockpiles for the year? Do you have an idea what that is?
Russell Ball: David, it's Russ. Just briefly we had inventory at year end that we're working through both in the bond but also ahead of the crushers. So we're seeing that through. We disclose that average grade on the stockpiles, and that was in the table, and they are actually in the appendix to this release. It will move around a little on a quarterly basis depending on where we were accessing in those stockpiles, but you should look to that. And the current year's production profile is a reasonable indication of an annual basis, again, with some quarterly volatility, and that's gets accentuated a little bit by productivity in the wet season. For us, we're going into the dry season, so we have 2 months of nice, dry roads, and in the fourth quarter, a little more challenging. So as we look at our current production profile, we're roughly in there. We also do have a schedule down on the segmental replacement, which will allow a throughput for the balance of the year. So that is an extended down as a fairly significant rebuilt, and we will see that obviously impact the availability in production.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: When they're down coming?
Russell Ball: In May.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: In May. Okay. In the last, what, 30 day or...
Russell Ball: It's about a 45-day down, David.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. And just Yanacocha, the tons declined, is that where the -- the tonnage throughput in this quarter that we should expect for the rest of the year?
Russell Ball: Yes. That's sort of in line. This was last year, and then this year is a lower leach tonnage placement year. So that's sort of a fairly good projection for where we expect to be. We're still expecting to be within original guidance at Yanacocha by year end.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Great. And recoveries should be similar but tons would be the same as it was in this quarter. Okay. And I think that was it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question from Michael Dudas with Jefferies & Company.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Russell, great presentation, especially on the cost movement in the industry. As you look out for Newmont the next couple of years, as you're transitioning towards the growth, of the 10 items that impact industry average cost, what are the 2 or 3 that we can look for to focus on for Newmont as that will impact your company on a general basis?
Russell Ball: Thanks, Mike. Sure, yes. It's a very interesting perspective, and I would like to remind people, we currently look at the top line, we're going to look at the top end of cost line. And I think what we'll see if that thesis is correct, the weaker U.S. dollar will drive gold production cost curves up, because obviously the majority of gold production is outside the U.S. So I think FX is the one that's going to be industrywide. Again, if the thesis is correct on a weaker U.S. dollar, and you've seen that certainly on a trade-weighted basis over the last couple of modes. The other issues, obviously, fuel for us. Energy costs are about 25% of our cost structure. Again, we have budgeted at $90 oil, and we're sitting today at around $110. And if you think about labor costs, that's about 45% of our cost structure. And labor costs are largely for us non-dollar denominated. So I'd say those in conjunction with our lower grades. These deposits, the average grade has decreased, and you've seen that in the gold industry and in the copper industry, where grades have come up significantly. So I think you've got grade and you've got things working against you. And it is going to be a challenge for us, as Richard said earlier, maintaining our relative position on that cost curve and at the end of the day looking, as John suggested, to try and manage some of the volatility around those cost structures, but clearly some challenges. I think what you will see on the cost is $35 to $45 to $50, who knows where silver prices are going to be. A lot of the producers with significant silver byproduct will be shielded because, clearly, silver has had incredible run over the last 6 to 9 months that will offset some of those cost pressures. But those are ones that I lose sleep over, Mike.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Fair enough. Just wished you had some rare earth to kind of offset some of that. Anyway, thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question from Pawel Rajszel with Veritas Investment Research.
Pawel Rajszel - Veritas Investment Research Corporation: It's Pawel Rajszel here. And just working off of the production outlook midpoint, roughly 5.2 million ounces, adding the 3.2 million that you have slated for growth and declining by the 1.6 million, getting to those 6.8 million, and I noticed in the Investor Day, you had the 200,000 of production that was kind of classified under other. I'm wondering if you could just give some clarity on where that 200,000 would come from to get you to the 7 million?
Randy Engel: Hi, it's Randy. I'll take that question. If you note in the same presentation, there was a slide that preceded that waterfall chart, and there were a few areas that we noted upside. In North America, the upside, we think there is good upside potential coming out of Hope Bay. In South America, we think there's good upside potentially in our portfolio in Suriname. In APAC, in our Asia-Pacific region, we have good upside coming out of KCGM. And then upside out of Africa, potentially coming out of Akyem. Those are the main areas where we see some of that adding up to 200 or perhaps slightly more.
Pawel Rajszel - Veritas Investment Research Corporation: Okay. Great. And earlier you had mentioned that you're looking for other opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Just wondering what your views are on share buybacks, especially if we get gold prices that are sustaining around the $1,500 mark that we have now?
Richard O'Brien: It's Richard. I'd just say at $1,500 there's a world of opportunity for us, and share buyback is certainly a tool that we could use. I think the gold price link dividend is one that provides some certainty and flexibility in that upward pricing environment, and there's an opportunity to share more with investors over time through that should we choose to do so. And then, additionally, I think with additional cash flow comes the ability to accelerate some of the production that we might have and some of our other projects that aren't even listed here. So I think that additional cash flow is really an opportunity for us to continue to underlie that growth with more certainty over time, provide more flexibly over time and provide the opportunity for our shareholders to benefit through not just upward sloping production but also upward sloping cash return. So a share buyback is certainly one of the tools we could use, but one of many.
Pawel Rajszel - Veritas Investment Research Corporation: I agree. And the just leading into that, I guess Hope Bay isn't in your timeline through 2017. What do you think it would take for that project to start to come in to the profile?
Richard O'Brien: Well, as you know, in our Hope Bay project at the moment, we're driving a decline. We're actually advancing that project, we think, in a very responsible way to ensure that we know how big the deposit can be before we commit significant infrastructure. But we're spending significant dollars on exploration. We believe in the district. We think there's significant upside there. I think our conservative stance here would say, we're now ready to advance this into our production timeline that we have on Slide 18. And as Randy pointed out, it's one of many opportunities to bring into production. We'll keep the street updated on that at the moment. As I said, we are driving decline, and I think things continue to look good for us and we'll continue to keep you updated.
Pawel Rajszel - Veritas Investment Research Corporation: Great. Thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Christie with Scotia Capital.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: One more question for you guys. On silver, you mentioned byproduct credits from silver, but I don't think you guys disclosed your silver grades anywhere. I was wondering if you could give me what your silver grades were at your probably -- your 2 most highest concentration of silver, be Yanacocha and La Herradura; is that right?
Russell Ball: David, it's Russ. We'll have to get back to you. We don't track our silver grades, and we don't report them on our reserves. But to your question, we did produce a fair amount of silver out of Midas. If you look at -- in the North America, Midas is the big producer and then Yanacocha, although the recovery is low, we did produce significant silver out of there, but I'll let John Seaberg to get back with you. Nearly at $5 no one paid too much attention to the silver production, but around $40 to $50, it is nice and we'll take it as we get.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Yes, as long as the byproduct credits were increasing nicely. So thank you.
Operator: Next question, Adam Golaski with Goldman Sachs.
Adam Golaski: You mentioned earlier that you are looking at acquisitions in a cash format, not in a format where you'll utilize shares. And you mentioned that, that approach limits your acquisition bite size. But you’ve still got greater than $5 billion of cash and marketables and liquidity on your balance sheet. So I'm wondering, is that the kind of bite size that we should be thinking about if we are thinking about how you might look at M&A opportunities?
Richard O'Brien: Just to be clear, what I said is one where -- I may not have said it clearly as I should have. When we look at acquisitions that don't bring current production, we would generally tend to use cash. And I think you could think of bite size as being kind of what we've done traditionally. Miramar was about $1.5 billion, Fronteer was about $2.3 billion. I think those are the sizes that are probably big enough for us, unless we see something clearly unusual, but again, just to emphasize, what we have on Slide 18 is really a way for us to underpin our growth without having to do additional acquisitions. And I think it's just additional upside for us. So we don't have to buy anything. If we do, we expect we'll buy it for value.
Adam Golaski: Great. Thank you. The question just has to do with the gold price link dividend. Can you talk about -- and I apologize for not knowing this, because I'm sure you probably mentioned it already somewhere else. But if and when the gold price should ever fall, and let's hope it's a long time away, but how does the gold price dividend behave? Is there any ways stickier on the way down than on the way up?
Russell Ball: Adam, if you look at the slide on Slide 11 there, where we've showed a downward $1,100 gold price, we would be at a $0.40 annual dividend. Obviously, the dividend and the level of that dividend is a function of the board's approval, and we discuss that quarterly with them. But as you said, we have a very strong balance sheet, still generating significant cash flow, and even at that $1,100 gold price, as we stress test for the downside, we still have that availability to maintain that dividend. So anything for at least $1,100 are just -- we would obviously take that to the board in light of ongoing other operating costs and financial capability that we have on the balance sheet.
Richard O'Brien: And I'll just underlie that this is a company which just take a dividend for a long period of time indicating both the financial strength and desire to ensure that shareholders have a reason to stay on this stock for yield really. So we'll continue to look at that, as Russ said, every quarter, and that really is the way that our board will approach this policy.
Adam Golaski: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Elizabeth Collins with Morningstar.
Elizabeth Collins: Can you give us a reminder of what Batu might look like once the ores reach in Phase 6? We have an idea of Phase 7 cost in production, but maybe you can give us a little bit more color on Phase 6 once the ores reach in late 2013?
Russell Ball: Yes. Hi, it's Russ. Phase 6 will look very similar to Phase 5. We were right in the bottom of phase 5, so I would use 2010 as a reasonable proxy. What we see is the bottom of these phases of ore is a disproportionately higher gold production versus copper. So both the copper and gold grade increase, but the gold grade increases proportionately more so. I'd looked to Phase 5 as a reasonable approximation for what we'll see in Phase 6 in 2014 and '15.
Elizabeth Collins: Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you very much for your attention today, and we hope you all have a great weekend and a good Easter.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings and exploration update call. With me today are the members of our executive leadership team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2, as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we'll begin on Slide 3. In 2010, Newmont generated the highest revenue, net income and operating cash flow in our 90-year history. A rising metals price environment converged with our emphasis on operational execution and yielded outstanding financial results. Today, we'll discuss our 2010 highlights but more importantly, we want to begin to tell you how we're leveraging our financial success and we'll continue that story into Investor Day in April.  We closed the books on 2010 with over $5.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our priorities for deploying cash remain consistent with what we've talked with you about before. They're designed to build our business and to maximize shareholder value. First, we are developing our internal project portfolio with about $1.1 billion in consolidated capital spending planned for our major projects at Conga, Akyem and Hope Bay. Next, we're leveraging our superior land position and infrastructure in some of the world's most prolific mining districts. In 2010, we delivered a net reserve increase on our base of well over 90 million ounces. We also continue to focus on near-mine exploration and early-stage development opportunities. Another way we're building for the future is by pursuing opportunistic M&A. This is evidenced by our announcement earlier this month that we plan to acquire Fronteer Gold. The integration of Fronteer's assets, particularly Long Canyon, will allow us to develop a district that we believe closely resembles the Carlin Trend, a region where Newmont has established infrastructure and experienced and motivated labor force and key relationships with various stakeholder groups. While our land positions and exploration activities along with opportunistic M&A provide access to new opportunities, our financial resources provide us the flexibility to capitalize on each of those priorities, as you can see on Slide 3.  Taking a closer look at our gold and copper operating margins on Slide 4, you'll see how Newmont has expanded its margins faster than the metal price for three years running. Boosting our operating margins increases our operating cash flow, which we can then deploy back into the business. We are bullish on gold, and the first seven weeks of 2011 certainly support that optimism. At $1,350 gold, for example, we expect that Newmont will be generating an operating margin of about $760 per ounce, providing additional cash flow to develop our business and increase shareholder value. Excerpts of our outlook are on Slide 5. In 2011, we expect to produce between 5.1 million to 5.3 million attributable ounces. This is a slight change from 2010 actuals due to lower expected Batu Hijau production as we move out of the bottom of the pit in Phase 5 more into Phase 6 stripping, partially offset by higher expected Nevada and Ahafo production. Costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per gold ounce and between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound of copper.  As you've seen with other releases, industry-wide pressures continue to impact CAS across the industry, and we're no different. But as Russell will point out, much of our increase comes from the Batu Hijau change I just mentioned. Capital spending on a consolidated basis is expected to be between $2.7 billion to $3 billion, which translates to about $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion on an attributable basis and is a substantial increase from last year. As I mentioned at the start of our call, we're generating considerable cash flow in the current environment. For 2011, this allows us to advance the development of a number of our projects, including Akyem, Conga and Hope Bay, which collectively represent about 40% of that capital spending. The balance will be spent on a combination of several expansion and optimization projects, routine replacement and a number of new project development and other mine life extensions that we'll talk about briefly.  Moving to Slide 6. Our 2011 cost applicable to sales are expected to be between $560 and $590 per ounce, as I mentioned, due to lower Batu Hijau and Yanacocha production, which results from higher waste removal and lower grades and higher energy and labor costs.  On Slide 7, we provided a comparison of our 2010 and '11 capital spending, highlighting increased spending at Conga and Akyem. In addition to that, our 2011 capital plan though does encompass continued reinvestment in each of our four regions. A few examples where we're deploying capital include: in Nevada where we're spending about $100 million towards Leeville/Turf and Peet Bajo [ph], two of the highest returning projects in our portfolio because they're very near existing infrastructure. At Yanacocha, we're spending about $200 million to bring forward the Western Oxides project and keep Yanacocha in production.  In our APAC region, about $120 million is going towards the Tanami, KCGM, Waihi and Jundee, where we are extending resources in each of those mines. And in Africa, we're excited about putting $75 million more towards the Subika underground development and continuing our Ahafo North early-stage work. In addition, we've embarked upon several sustaining capital investments that maintain or extend mine production and boost mill efficiency across our operations.  Actually, sustaining capital as a percentage of total capital spending is lower this year than it was last year. As I stated earlier, we're generating solid cash flow that we're redeploying back into the business.  I'll now turn the call over to Russell to discuss in a little more depth our 2010 operating and financial performance.
Russell Ball: Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 8, you will see our key operating and financial highlights for 2010. We reported record results driven by strong metal prices and our continued focus on operational execution and delivery. Revenue at $9.5 billion, cash from continuing operations at $3.2 billion and adjusted net income of $1.9 billion are all record amounts for the company.  As you can see on Slide 9, we realized an average price of $1,222 per ounce of gold and $3.43 per pound of copper for the year. And while both were record prices for Newmont, they remain significantly below current spot prices of approximately $1,415 and $430 per pound, respectively. Our gold operating margin increased 30% year-over-year to $737 per ounce, outpacing the 25% increase in the gold price.  Turning to the fourth quarter comparison on Slide 10. Attributable production was down 7% primarily on lower production from Nevada due to the pit wall failure at the end of 2009 and the cessation of mining at Deep Post at the end of 2009, and from Yanacocha due to lower leach ore placement, transitional ore stockpiling at La Quinua and lower mill ore grade due to mine sequencing. These declines were offset by increased production from Boddington, which commenced commercial production in November 2009. Adjusted net income was up 2% versus the year-ago quarter, with higher metal prices offset the impacts of lower production and higher operating costs, which I will discuss in more detail on Slide 11. Slide 11 reconciles our actual cost applicable to sales of $485 per ounce, with our original outlook provided in February 2010. Cost applicable to sales for gold were approximately $4 above the midpoint of our original outlook, which was based on a $900 gold price assumption and an AUD $0.80 exchange rate assumption. Stronger Australian dollar added $22 per ounce to costs, which were offset by approximately $10 per ounce and hedging gains from our Australian book for net impact of $12 per ounce.  Lower volumes primarily at Boddington boosted our 2010 budget, and given the fixed-cost nature of our business, added a further $9 per ounce. Higher gold prices drove higher royalty and workers participation costs, which increased cost by about $7 an ounce. As I've said before, these type of cost increases that are tied to the gold price are ones we are happy to pay, given the significant margin-related expansion that occurs.  On the other hand, we saw favorable by-product credits of $6 an ounce and diesel savings of about $2 an ounce, given our assumption at the beginning of the year of $80 per ounce West Texas. Obviously, with the unrest in Libya and the broader Middle East, oil prices have escalated significantly in recent weeks.  Before I turn it over to Guy Lansdown for his reserve and exploration update, I wanted to make a point in regards to reported cost applicable to sales per ounce on a go-forward basis, historically a significant metric in this business. As a U.S. company, Newmont will not be reporting under IFRS accounting for 2011 or indeed for anytime in the future. And what this means is that our reported CAS per ounce number is no longer an apples-to-apples comparison with most of our Canadian peers are now reporting under IFRS. The differences can be quite significant. And without getting into the details, there are numerous costs that can be capitalized under IFRS that we will be expensing in 2011 and beyond. Our personal view is that the resulting lack of direct comparability between income statements will result in even more attention to the cash flow statement and the company's ability to generate operating cash flows, both on an absolute basis but more importantly on a per share basis as a measure of long-term value. Quite frankly, we welcome this attention.  With that brief diversion into the accounting, debits and credits, I will turn it over to Guy.
Guy Lansdown: Thanks, Russell. On to Slide 12. We are particularly encouraged by today's gold and copper reserves report, which reflects over 8 million new gold ounces in reserves, a 2% growth net of depletion and 300 million new pounds of copper representing a 3% increase over last year. As a large senior gold producer, we are thrilled to be in a position to boost our reserves on a net basis and primarily through the drill bit.  Our 2010 drilling program resulted in total copper reserves at record levels of 9.4 billion pounds and near record reserves of 93.5 million ounces of gold. North America was the largest contributor to higher gold reserves in 2010, with additions at Leeville/Turf, Twin Creeks, Phoenix and La Herradura. Other large reserve additions we made at Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region and at Ahafo in the Africa region. North America also made the largest contribution to non-reserve mineralization, with significant additions at Gold Quarry, Leeville/Turf, Buffalo Valley and Twin Creeks. Initial NRM was declared at the Merian Gold greenfield project in Suriname, solidifying the exciting potential in the region. Other noteworthy contributors to NRM included KCGM and Tanami in the Asia-Pacific region.  For 2011, we have budgeted about $360 million for exploration, which covers both expense and capital on a consolidated basis and is an increase of over 40% from 2010. On Slide 13, you can see the breakdown by region. This larger budget gives us additional flexibility to work on substantial mine life-extending projects, such as Subika and Leeville/Turf. With more dollars to invest back into the business, we are focusing on large district potential targets like the sleeping giants in Nevada, which includes Mike, Fiberline, Greater Phoenix and Copper Basin, as well as Elang in Indonesia, Yanacocha Verde in Peru and Merian in Suriname.  Now I'll turn the call over to Brian Hill to discuss our operational results.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Guy. Turning to Slide 14. Before we jump into discussing the regional performance, it's important to step back and echo Richard's earlier point about investing and developing our business. Newmont has a total land position of over 32,000 square miles around the globe. The opportunities to invest in our business are rich and varied, from traditional oxide deposits to sulfide deposits and gold-copper porphyries. We believe we have significant potential to develop new districts across our four regions, and the scope of new development opportunities is nearly equal to that of our existing operations. On each of our regional slides, we will share our capital spending budget with a breakout between near mine and sustaining capital. At our Investor Day in April, we'll provide more details on how we are leveraging our existing operations into future development.  Let's begin our recap of regional performance with North America. Full year 2010 attributable gold production in Nevada decreased 13% due to the completion of underground mining at Deep Post in 2009; lower Gold Quarry ore mine as a result of the pit wall failure which occurred in December 2009; lower leach tons placed at Twin Creeks and Carlin, partially offset by increased underground mining at Leeville.  Total ore tons mined were 26% lower, mainly due to the Gold Quarry slope failure and the completion of mining at North Lantern in April 2010. Ore placed on leach pads decreased 62% to 4.5 million tons. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 11% due to lower production, partially offset by higher by-product credits.  Full year 2010 attributable gold production at La Herradura increased 54% to 49,000 ounces compared to 2009 due to the commencement of commercial production at the Soledad and Dipolos pits in January 2010, where we've been really pleased with the results. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 13% due to higher waste tons mined.  In 2011, we expect to produce 2 million to 2.1 million attributable ounces in North America at costs applicable to sales of approximately $560 to $600 per ounce. Our North American capital budget is $600 million to $700 million for 2011, which includes building on Hope Bay's successful drill program, which yielded many high-grade intercepts last year; further development in Nevada, including Leeville/Turf and East Carlin, development at Peet Bajo [ph] and the Exodus exploration drift, as well as work at the Noche Buena pit in La Herradura in Mexico.  As previously announced, Newmont plans to acquire Fronteer Gold, which includes the Long Canyon development project. Turning to Slide 15, you'll see how we view Long Canyon in the context of other major gold trends in Nevada. The chart at right shows where Long Canyon is in its current stage of development relative to the other more established gold trends in the region. We believe that it can potentially grow into the next major mineralized trend in Nevada, and we expect to close this transaction in early April. Turning to Slide 16. Our South American regions performance reflects the maturity of our Yanacocha mine combined with new contributions from La Zanja and development activity at Conga. Full year 2010 Yanacocha gold production attributable to Newmont decreased 27% from the prior year due to mine sequencing resulting in lower leach placements, transitional or stockpiling at La Quinua and lower grade and recovery resulting in lower mill production. Leach tons placed decreased from a record of 136 million tons in 2009 to 59 million tons in 2010. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 39% from the prior year due to higher waste material mine, lower production, higher labor, diesel and maintenance costs and higher workers participation and royalty costs as a result of higher gold prices. These were partially offset by higher by-product credits. Attributable gold production was 21,000 ounces in 2010 at La Zanja, which was in its first year of contribution to Newmont's operating results, and we continue to be impressed with the operational leadership from our partners at Buenaventura. 2010 attributable gold production in South America is expected to be approximately 715,000 to 775,000 ounces, slightly lower than 2010 actuals primarily due to lower leach production at Yanacocha. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase in 2011 to approximately $500 to $550 per ounce, primarily due to lower leach production and higher contracted services and supplies.  Our South American capital budget is $900 million to $1.1 billion in 2011, which includes construction activity at Conga, where we've recently signed our EPC contractor, as well as engaged contractors for mills and motors, the main access road, camp buildings and water treatment plants. Our capital budget also includes development of the Western Oxides project in Peru and several sustaining capital projects in the region.  On Slide 17, our Asia-Pacific region saw a favorable boost in gold and copper production through a full year's contribution from our Boddington mine, as well as the best-ever gold production from our Batu Hijau mine. 2010 gold production at Boddington was approximately 730,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $590 per ounce. 2010 attributable copper and gold production at Batu Hijau increased 10% and 32%, respectively, in 2010 over the prior year due to higher grade and mill throughput as a result of mining at the bottom of Phase 5 and processing softer ore. Unseasonably dry weather permitted extended mining in the bottom of Phase 5 during the fourth quarter. We expect to process stockpiled ore until Phase 6 ore becomes the primary mill feed commencing in late 2013. Costs applicable to sales increased 11% per ounce and per pound due to higher waste mining, labor and diesel costs. Across our other Asia-Pacific assets, full year 2010 attributable gold production decreased 7% due to lower mill grade at Jundee and Waihi and lower mill grade and throughput at Tanami, partially offset by higher grade throughput and recovery at KCGM. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased 9% due to lower production, higher diesel costs and a stronger Australian dollar. 2011 attributable production for the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be approximately 1.9 million to 2 million ounces, primarily as a result of lower production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable the sales are expected to increase to approximately $600 to $675 per ounce in 2011, primarily driven by lower Batu Hijau production. We expect attributable copper production for the Asia-Pacific operations of approximately 190 million to 220 million pounds at costs applicable to sales of approximately $1.25 to $1.50 per pound in 2011.  Our 2011 capital spending budget for the Asia-Pacific region is $650 million to $750 million and includes efforts to increase resources and extend mine life at Tanami, Jundee and KCGM. In addition, we're evaluating further expansion opportunities at Boddington and mill optimization at Batu Hijau.  At Boddington, we developed a revised mine plan in the fourth quarter to deliver the best possible grade to the mill. From a volume standpoint, it's notable that Boddington produced 206,000 attributable ounces of gold in the fourth quarter despite a seven-day total plant shutdown to integrate the sixth MP 1000 secondary crusher. Today, we are seeing mining performance, processing throughput rates, grades in recovery consistent with our 2011 outlook. Debottlenecking studies have commenced to identify opportunities to optimize production through the existing plant infrastructure and are planned to be complete during the second quarter of this year. We also continue to promote Boddington's exploration potential as the deposit remains open laterally and at depth. Boddington's reserves remain over 20 million ounces of gold, and approximately 40,000 meters of drilling is planned in 2011 as we target opportunities for extensions of the known resource and test regional targets. Turning to Slide 19. Our Africa region had a terrific year. They continue to deliver consistent performance and symbolize why we're so excited about Newmont's future growth in this region. Full year attributable gold ounces produced increased 2% to 545,000 ounces due to higher grade ore mined at Apensu and the commencement of production at Amoma in October, which began operations slightly ahead of schedule and under budget. Costs applicable to sales per ounce increased less than 1% to $450 per ounce due to higher labor, power, diesel and royalty costs, partially offset by higher production. 2011 attributable gold production for the Africa operation is expected to be approximately 550,000 to 590,000 ounces, primarily due to higher expected ore grades. Costs applicable to sales of approximately $485 to $535 per ounce are expected for 2011, primarily as a result of higher energy prices and higher labor and royalty costs. Our 2011 capital budget for Africa is $450 million to $545 million. The bulk of which is allocated to advancing our Akyem project, which will eventually support a doubling of our annual production in this region. In addition, we have capital allocated to the Ahafo North opportunity and to the Subika underground, which is expected to contribute to Newmont's production later this year subject to permitting.  I'll now turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Brian. Now I'd like to turn the discussion from our past performance briefly to the future. As you see on this map, we continue to maintain and expand our land positions and our investments in some of the world's most prolific gold producing regions. We are building value for our shareholders by investing in each of our regions through near-mine development and major projects, exploration and opportunistic M&A. We believe Newmont has some of the best development opportunities in the industry and the financial resources to pursue them. And we're looking forward to sharing more details of our longer-term development plans with you at our Investor Day in New York on April 7.  I'd like to thank all of our employees and contractors around the world for all of their hard work to deliver on a really great 2010, and we have really strengthened our ability to continue to deliver strong and consistent performance and a very strong balance sheet to continue to allow us to build for the future. Newmont turns 90 this year, and with record financial results in 2010, we're embracing the future and believe our business is as strong as ever and we're well prepared to deliver value from our business platform.  With that, I'd like to thank all of you for listening and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I just wondered, this pullback to 5.1 million to 5.3 million, is this the new base? Are you comfortable that you can maintain this level? I know you're going to talk in more detail in April, but is this the new base that hopefully you can grow from?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I think this is a pretty good base for us to look at for the next five years or so. I think we've, as we've disclosed before, I think with a few things going on in Nevada with the repair of the Gold Quarry slide, I think we see Nevada continuing to stabilize and improve its production level. And I think in Australia, we will have to continue to see good drifting and good results at Jundee to continue to expand that mine in the next three to five years. But I think in general, John, across the portfolio, this is a good level for the future to build on.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The Western Oxides, I don't recall that project before. Could maybe Guy give us a bit give us a bit more detail on that?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, sure. John, thanks for the question. Western Oxides is a project that sits on the Western side of the operation, which composes Chaquicocha and Yanacocha, and it's really putting some more laybacks into those and additional smaller pits. So it is really expanding the oxide deposits that we have there already. In addition to the Western Oxides, we're looking on the eastern side as well. We continue to build on our existing pits and develop further laybacks, so that's really what is. The continuation of the current oxide pits.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: There was another example of projects that are coming about because of the higher gold price.
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that's correct. And also increased exploration.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Any thoughts on the strip ratio on that?
Guy Lansdown: I don't have that information available. Sorry, John, but we can get that for you.
John Seaberg: I can get that for you later, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: My question is for Richard really in terms of if we could get an update as to how you're thinking about how much free cash flow would be left over for dividends. Basically, you've doubled your CapEx program to about $2.8 billion, of which around $1.7 million is discretionary. You are embarking on a $2.3 billion acquisition. So you're spending about $4 billion of what I would consider growth in discretionary opportunities. Your dividend policy at $0.60 remains around a $300 million total cash outlay. So I was just wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast if you think, now that you've announced this growth plan, that there will be any room left for incremental dividend in 2011? Or are you comfortable with the current level?
Richard O'Brien: I'd say, Jorge, that -- obviously, the dividend is a board decision, but I'd tell you how we think about it, which is based on the current balance sheet that we have, the fact that even with an announced acquisition of Fronteer Gold, which is for all intents and purposes covered by our generation of free cash flow in 2010, I think we're well positioned to continue to both invest in the business as well as look at return to capital to shareholders. So I think the board has that flexibility. With respect to your question on free cash flow generation, obviously it depends on gold price. But given where we are today, I'd say we're $500 million plus of free cash flow with a significant balance sheet to carry that through. So I think to the extent that the market pays for dividends, and we'll associate share increases with that, I think we're prepared to consider that. To the extent that the market prefers growth and we should be investing in our growth platform, we will consider that. The great news about Newmont and our balance sheet and cash flow is we can do both.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: And sorry, just following up a little bit on John's question about the kind of steady state for the foreseeable; you said about the next five years. You kind of see the volumes in a 5.1 million to 5.3 million-ounce range. So the current CapEx program is not really pulling forward any kind of incremental volumes that we would see in the near term?
Richard O'Brien: Well, we are making a number of investments, which I'd say is far too early to evaluate whether they are going to add productions in the next three to five years. We certainly have a number of projects, which will add production beyond the five-year period in this capital profile. And when we come to Investor Day, we'll be able to give you a little better view into what we think of the future even beyond 2012 or '13 as we start to continue to reinvest in the business. I'm going to ask Randy to add to that.
E Engel: So if you look at the chart that we showed on Page 7, we have about 23% of our project capital going into other projects. That would be the area where we're investing in some of the longer-term increase, potential increases in production. But the bulk of what we've got, roughly 3/4 of it, is going into Conga. As you can see, we have about $550 million to $700 million going into Conga this coming year. We've got about $300 million to $375 million going into Akyem, and then about $70 million to $100 million going into Hope Bay. So most of what you're seeing in the increase this year is focused on, in particular, Conga and Akyem.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: And then in April, you will give more of a medium-term volume target at your Investor Day?
E Engel: Right.
Richard O'Brien: We plan to do that, yes.
Operator: Next question from David Christie with Scotia Capital.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: First of all in Boddington, the sort of 750,000 to 800,000 ounces a year, is this sort of where you see the mine going for the long term now? Or are we going to get up to sort of where we previously expected it to get to?
Brian Hill: David, it's Brian. I think our intention is to work towards where we expected Boddington to be on the longer term, which is in that 800,000 to 850,000 ounce range. As I mentioned, we're in the middle of some significant work around debottlenecking. We're really comfortable that we're seeing grades reconcile well with our revised model. And for us now, it's really about optimizing that existing plant, getting the plant availability up to the point where we want it to be. But our objective is to work towards getting to that longer-term target.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: When you talk about reserves and resources there for this year, did you change how you did it at all as far as dilution or grades reconciliation?
Guy Lansdown: David, this is Guy. When we did reserve calculation, we've taken into account the latest models and adjustments that we've seen to date. And as you can see, our reserves have remained pretty much in line with what we had last year.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And in the exploration spend, you upped the exploration spend by about $100 million from last year, actually more than that. Can you give me an idea where the biggest spends are happening?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, sure, David. The bulk of our spend, about $10 million, went into generative exploration. We've put more funds into our generative programs. But the bulk of the additional spend went into the near mine, mainly in North America and Hope Bay. So the areas that we'd be focusing on are Leeville/Turf, Hope Bay, Midas, Fiberline. Those are just examples of where we're putting them. In addition, we're spending dollars on Elang, which has got a permit to start exploring there. So the bulk of the dollars are, as you can see, in North America and Hope Bay.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And those are all expense exploration that you're doing at $345 million?
Guy Lansdown: I believe it's...
Richard O'Brien: The $360 million includes both expense and capital.
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that's correct. So $360 million is consolidated exploration expense including capitalized expenses.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. So what would be the expense portion of that?
Russell Ball: David, Russ. Somewhere around $300 million to $340 million, just depending on where we end up putting the drills. The near-mine reserves stuff and infill drilling gets capitalized. So it will be somewhere around the $320 million number.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And just on the production side, give me an idea of -- the production in Nevada seems quite a bit better than I was expecting for this year. Can you give me idea what the breakdown is between the various assets there?
Richard O'Brien: We don't give the production by each asset, but Brian can give you a sort of a headline on what's kind of changed from maybe what we saw a year ago.
Brian Hill: Yes, I think, David, one of the big things we saw was increased production coming out of Leeville. We've seen higher grades coming out of Leeville than we had anticipated. And Leeville is probably the predominant asset, which has led to better production. We've also seen some increased production and performance coming out of Phoenix in 2010. So those are probably the two assets that have contributed the most to seeing better production coming out of Nevada.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And the Gold Quarry, are you getting that up and running faster as far as the...
Brian Hill: We're not back into ore yet, but we expect to be back into ore relatively soon. That whole remediation effort has gone extremely well a little bit quicker than planned, and we're expecting to be back into ore in Gold Quarry before late Q2.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Patrick Chidley with HSBC.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: Just questions on the cap expenditure in, for example, in Australia. I see the Boddington capital this year is still going to be quite high. I'm wondering if that's a level that you're planning to continue.
Brian Hill: Patrick, it's Brian. No, that's related to some very specific work we're doing around tailings, expansion, some of the other work that we're doing around plant optimization. But it's not going to be a level that we expect to see on a longer-term basis.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: So would we expect that in 2012 to come down fairly dramatically?
Brian Hill: I would certainly expect it to come down in 2012.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: And then at the other operations in Australia, also a fairly high dollar per ounce capital numbers. Is that something that's related to new shafts or new expansion capital? Or is it to, again, a level that we should expect long term?
Brian Hill: Most of it is related to new development. We've got some significantly interesting parallel resources that we're developing at the Tanami. So a lot of it's around development work to delineate those resources, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. Similar at Jundee, we're looking at developing additional shoots at Jundee, expansion at Waihi, layback at KCGM. A lot of it's around looking at delineating new resources and extending the mine lives.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: Okay. So not something that we should expect to continue at that level going forward as a long term?
Richard O'Brien: Well, Patrick, I'd say, hopefully, we'll continue to see success, particularly around the Tanami and Jundee, which will allow us to realize production quicker than we thought and to go ahead and capitalize and build-out for that. That would be a great result from our perspective.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: The numbers at Tanami, they exclude a new shaft there or have you sort of come to a decision on...
Richard O'Brien: They do not currently include a new shaft in these numbers, no.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: And then just a quick one on -- you mentioned a little bit more the Merian project in Suriname, 1.8 million ounce resource, with a positive scoping study. I'm wondering if you could flesh out a few more details on just how positive that was and what the plan is going ahead.
Guy Lansdown: Yes. Patrick, this is Guy. We've completed really the pre-feasibility study, what we call our stage 2, but that's pre-feasibility study. So we've gone through that process. At the moment, we're in discussions with the government trying to get a mining agreement or the mineral agreement. And from what we've seen from the drill results and the initial studying that we've done, we were very happy to advance it into the next stage.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: So that presumably could be, you know what I'm saying, some new fronts for Newmont in terms of possibly new mines there?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that's right. I mean, if you think about it, we think about it in terms of a district as well, because we've got some pretty big exploration projects in Suriname. We've talked a bit about Cassador, which is a new discovery we made last year, and we've also got the Saramacca deposit that we continue to explore on. So we're pretty excited that this could turn into a new district for the company.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: Any view you on when the government will come to an agreement there with you?
Guy Lansdown: Difficult to say, Patrick. We're in the throes of talking to them at present.
Richard O'Brien: I think it's fair to say that this could be an emerging district that clearly, it's a longer-term orientation for us with some shorter-term challenges with respect to just making sure that we get the right agreement with the government, and I think this is something that our South American team is great at. And we'll work through this and hopefully be able to build on a recent meeting that the President had with some people in the region to get support for the project. So I think things are going pretty well.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC Holdings plc: Just a quick one on Elang. You mentioned Elang, you've got a permit to start exploration. How much work and what kind of work will you be doing this year?
Guy Lansdown: This year, we've got to re-establish the camp. And we've got to start working with the communities before we get back onto the ground and drilling. But we did plan on actually getting some drills into the ground later on this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank: I'd just like to go back to Boddington and make sure I've got this clear. We talked about a longer-term goal of 850,000, I think you've said. And originally, I thought it was going to be higher than that and sort of going back down to that level. Should we now think of it more just a flat line as opposed to better stuff in the early years? And the second part of the question is if that's the case, I guess the gold grade's a little lower but the copper grade's a bit higher and continue to be higher. Should we also then establish our copper production going forward at more a level you've sort of forecast this year versus what might have been in the original feasibility? Or do we still just have to do a little more work to know exactly what's going on?
Brian Hill: It's Brian, Brian. Yes, I think we should be thinking in terms of that longer-term 850,000-ounce production rate for now. As I said, we're doing some more debottlenecking, and we'll look at ways at which we may be able to further optimize that asset considering the 20 million plus reserve base that we have at Boddington. In terms of copper, I think where we're seeing copper is copper is performing about in line with the expectations right now. So that's where I'd be sort of projecting it as we go forward. It's always reconciled relatively well with our model, and we don't really see any change in the copper.
Richard O'Brien: And I'd just add to that, Brian, that we have done a good job of getting back into Boddington and looking at the capital that could be invested in the plant. If we determine that it makes sense to speed up production, if we can just get the base established really what's in front of us, and Guy and Brian and the team have done a nice job drilling up the pit for this year and into next year, so I think we feel pretty good about this level of production. I would say this is a long-term asset, as Brian said. We have a tremendous plant capability down there. Darren and the team in Australia are working on the mining rate, and I think that there continues to be opportunity. But that opportunity is going to take some time for us develop and again, we'll give you a further update in April and as it goes on. But for now, I think this is a pretty good level for us to project off of. And hopefully, as with a lot of opportunities at Newmont, we see more opportunities in the future both in and around Boddington.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank: Maybe just quickly on Yanacocha. You talk about, obviously, costs being up here at contractor services and obviously, the world's changed. Just given the mix of things that's going on there over the next couple of years, should we again sort of predict same sort of production and costs for the next two to three years there? Or do you get an adjustment all before Conga comes in?
Brian Hill: No, this is a sort of the comfortable level at which we would be looking at Yanacocha over the next couple of years. And as Guy talked about Western Oxides, we do have some really interesting opportunities in the pipeline that if they do come to fruition, we have the opportunity to look at increasing that rate.
Richard O'Brien: And I'd just add to that, that when we're talking about production rates and costs, I think it's really important to just continue to remember what we started with, which is we're in a bullish environment for gold. We will continue to find opportunities to expand the business in that environment. It will also impact our costs, though. I mean, last year when we gave guidance, we were providing guidance at $900 an ounce. This year, we're providing guidance at $1,300 an ounce. And that change alone really does impact our costs. And as Russ says, that's sort of a high-class problem for us. And we'll go with higher costs as long as we have increasing margins, why you see us focusing on increasing margin to drive cash flow and generate value for the business through reinvestment, both in exploration and into our projects, and I think that's the story you're going to continue to hear us pound away in April and I think provide further evidence for.  Okay. Thanks, all, for attending today, and we look forward to seeing you in April in New York. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the conference for today. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-11-01 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Jeff Wilhoit - Vice President of Investor Relations Chuck Jeannes - President, Chief Executive Officer Lindsay Hall - Chief Financial Officer Steve Reid - Chief Operating Officer
Analysts: Tony Lesiak - Macquarie Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank Patrick Chidley - HSBC Greg Barnes - TD Newcrest Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Steven Butler - Canaccord Genuity John Bridges - JPMorgan David Christie - Scotia Capital 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc 2010 third quarter results conference call for Thursday, October 28, 2010. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President of Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit: Thank you and welcome to the Goldcorp third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. In the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Reid, Chief Operating Officer. For those of you participating on the webcast today, we have included a number of slides to support this morning's discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com. As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations, and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amounts of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures and cost and timing of the development of new deposits. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldcorp.
Chuck Jeannes: Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you saw in yesterday's earnings announcement, Goldcorp delivered strong financial results in the third quarter driven by continued high gold prices and our lowest cash costs in over two years. Cash margins of $979 per ounce of gold drove record cash flow of over $470 million and a 65% increase in earnings. In light of our solid financial position and confidence in our ability to generate strong, sustained cash flows, our board of directors yesterday approved a 100% increase in Goldcorp's dividend to $0.36 per share of $0.03 per month. We've been anticipating the completion of capital spending and the commencement of cash flow generation of Penasquito for some time. With the successful commencement of commercial operations there during the quarter we're pleased to be able to share the success with our shareholders. On the production side, another outstanding quarter at Red Lake and generally solid performance throughout the rest of the portfolio offset the impact of heavy rainfall at Los Filos and production weakness at Marigold and Alumbrera. Overall gold production this quarter was 506,200 ounces at extremely low cash costs of $260 per ounce on a byproduct basis and $429 per ounce on a co-product basis. With just a single month of commercial production in the third quarter, Penasquito managed to steal the spotlight with a very strong start to its life as a commercially producing mine. The power of Penasquito to positively contribute to our overall financial performance is already evident and Steve and Lindsay will discuss more of the details in a moment. An important theme in 2010 has been the successful execution of our disciplined portfolio management strategy. Put simply, we continually pursue opportunities to strengthen the overall portfolio through the divestiture of non-core assets and the addition of high-quality gold projects. We were very successful in this endeavor during the third quarter with the divestitures in the San Dimas mine and our terrain metals investment. In general terms, the cash proceeds from these transactions, as well as the second quarter sale of the Escobal silver deposit, are available to fund most of the cash component of our acquisition of Andean Resources. That acquisition remains on track for closing in late December. We currently have a team on the ground in Argentina working on transition issues with Andean and preparing to advance the project. We're certainly excited about getting to work on this project, which provides the ability to both enhance our growth in gold production and lower our already low cash cost profile. As I mentioned earlier, one month of commercial operations at Penasquito contributed significantly to our third quarter performance. Total revenues were over $86 million in the month of September while earnings from operations were over $34 million. These numbers include the impact of a disproportionately large amount of oxide gold production, which is typically sold later in each quarter. But production of all metals met or exceeded expectations. Cash costs on a byproduct basis were negative $577 per ounce of gold sold for the month of September and $499 per ounce on a co-product basis. Unit costs for mining, processing and G&A continued to decline according to plan. Construction of the 130,000 ton per day sulfide plant is now essentially complete with mechanical completion of the height and pressure grinding rural circuit and commissioning of that circuit underway. We now continue to ramp up production and we're maintaining our guidance of 180,000 ounces of gold for the year. Positioning Penasquito for full production capacity in early 2011 remains a top priority but we're also making major progress in advancing our next tranche of high-quality growth projects. On our September Canadian asset tour, some of you saw firsthand our progress in developing the kosher project. This is an important part of our Red Lake District optimization efforts and we expect to have a scoping study completed by year-end. An update to the pre-feasibility study for Eleonore will reflect this year's larger gold resource and will also be completed by year end and its becoming increasingly apparent that this project is poised to be another key cornerstone mine for Goldcorp. We also continue to advance our 70% owned El Morro project in Chile, including updating the 2008 feasibility study, advancing permitting and continuing to cultivate key relationships in the local communities and throughout all levels of government. Steve and I were just in Chile reviewing the project with our team there and I'm very pleased with the progress and potential of this project. Finally, we'll also have an initial scoping study completed at Noche Buena which will help us advance the opportunity there to improve our overall goal production profile at Penasquito. We've reaffirmed 2010 production guidance of approximately 2.55 million gold ounces. We expect a very strong fourth quarter but in view of the third quarter weakness at certain of the operations there is some risk in this forecast. On the positive side, in light of the very strong cost performance year-to-date, we now expect to come in below our previous cash cost guidance of $350 an ounce on a byproduct basis and $450 an ounce on a co-product basis. Demand for gold remained very strong in the third quarter as investors continued to seek a safe haven for preserving wealth amid an uncertain economic environment and ongoing currency instability. As investors see greater leverage to hire gold prices I believe we'll see increasing interest in the companies that produce it safely and responsibly, particularly those with proven track records of growing gold reserves and operating in lower risk jurisdictions. Over the past 10 years, Goldcorp has outperformed the physical metal as well as our industry peers by delivering on those very attributes and we expect this performance to continue in the future. Paying a higher dividend, as we announced yesterday, combined with our outstanding growth profile, only enhances that overall value proposition. With third quarter reporting now behind us we quickly turn our attention to completing our 2011 budget, including updated five-year and life-of-mine plans for all of the mines and projects. This is a very exciting time as we work out the details of how all of our growth projects line up to continue to significantly expand our production and financial performance. We look forward to sharing this updated information with all of you early in the New Year. With that, I'll now turn it over to Steve Reid for a review of the operations. Steve?
Steve Reid: Thanks, Chuck. As Chuck mentioned, we saw a consistent production this quarter from most of our mines. Red Lake led the way with production totaling 176,100 ounces at cash cost of just $268 per ounce. The key theme at Red Lake is the increasing flexibility we have to manage our production. We continue to improve the utilization of existing mill capacity by supplementing the ore feed with tons from the lower-grade sulfide and [far east] zones. The 4499 expiration ramp and the connection drift between the Campbell and Red Lake complexes provide the flexibility to move equipment at the lower levels of the mine to develop new production zones and to add gold reserves. During the quarter, excellent expiration results were seen in the deep high-grade zone as well as in the hanging well structures higher in the orebody. Red Lake remains well positioned to achieve or exceed its guidance of 275,000 ounces in 2010. You will have seen in yesterday's release that as many of you requested we've enhanced our reporting for the Porcupine by breaking out the production between the oil pond underground operation, the dome underground and the stockpiles. The backbone of our production at the Porcupine is the oil pond underground operation and work continued there on the construction of the [deep wins] that will help us better access the orebody over the long term both at depth and laterally to new zones of mineralization that we've discovered. These zones, both the (inaudible) continue to return good expiration results. In September we announced the discovery of a new, higher-grade orebody at Musselwhite called the Lynx Zone shown here and our drilling activity in the third quarter at Musselwhite was focused on further defining the magnitude and extent of the zone which remains open updip. It's near our existing underground infrastructure and has the potential to significantly contribute to year-end reserves and to materially enhance the mine's gold production profile over the long term. At Los Filos, rainfall during Southern Mexico's wet season caused dilution of the leeching solution and led to decreased production during the quarter but we expect to recover these ounces in the fourth quarter as the backlog of solution is processed and Los Filos remains on track to meet previous guidance of 300,000 ounces in 2010. Penasquito's mill throughput continued to build throughout the third quarter such that by early September when we reached the 30-day average throughput to 70,000 tons per day we declared commercial production for accounting purposes. But as I've often said, we have in effect been in operational production since January. Within the context of the overall project ramp up we remain very pleased with the pace of progress. The last component of the initial construction process is the high-pressure grinding roll circuit which achieved mechanical completion in mid-October. Commissioning of the HPGRs which are designed to crush oversized material from the milling circuit is currently underway and progressing well and, in fact, we plan to run oil through the circuit for the first time today. This final step will allow us to bring Penasquito to its designed production capacity of 130,000 tons per day in early 2011. At Noche Buena, the nearby satellite deposit, the potential for an additional source of significant oxide gold production took another step forward. The 2010 drilling program was completed in August. Column leach metallurgical testing commenced and an environmental baseline study was completed. This will all be combined with preliminary engineering analyses in the scoping study to be completed by the end of the year. At the second satellite project, Camino Rojo, positive negotiations continue with the local communities for surface rights and exploration. Gold production at Penasquito totaled 44,500 ounces with sulfide production surpassing that from the oxide material for the first time, 25,900 ounces of sulfide and 18,600 ounces from the heat leaching of the oxide cap. Penasquito remains on track towards our previously issued 2010 guidance of 190,000 ounces. At Cochenour near Red Lake, underground development continues and we've now completed more than 18% of the critical path development on the five kilometer high-speed haulage drift that will connect the Cochenour operation with the Red Lake mine. Exploration drilling into the Bruce Channel Deposit continued from the old underground workings at the 2050 level is currently on hold while we work on the Cochenour shaft and head works. The scoping study remains on track for completion by year-end. At Eleonor, after previously completing the pre-sinking during the second quarter, the shaft work in the third quarter focused on the hit frame and hoist house so there was no sinking of the exploration shaft during the quarter. However, full phase sinking is expected to commence in the fourth quarter and proceed through 2011. During the quarter, project permitting activities progressed and the project permit is expected in mid 2011 as previously planned. We also achieved the key milestone that's been several years in the making with the delivery of grid power to the site to significantly reduce power costs and the logistics of producing power. Our exploration drill program continued with a concentration on identifying and defining new ore zones within the hanging wall stratigraphy close to the exploration shaft and the program also focused on the definition of the edge of the main Roberto zone. Results of the hanging wall drilling obtained today have been positive and additional drilling will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2010 to follow up the downdip extensions and the pre-feasibility study is being updated to accommodate this year's larger resource and will be completed by year-end. We anticipate the positive study results will trigger a formal construction decision but, as you can see from the photograph, the site is beginning to resemble a mine already. The EIA process at El Morro in Chile remains on progress with approval anticipated by late this year or early 2011. We continue to meet with key government officials and community leaders to develop strong partnerships. Our team in Chile is currently reviewing the previous feasibility study to update the project capital and operating costs before year-end. Across the organization, we underspent on capital in the third quarter. This does not reflect any change in either priorities or project scope, rather simply the timing of the expenditures. Consequently, the full-year capital guidance has been slightly reduced and may result in a carryover into the 2011 budget year. Also I want to take this opportunity to thank our teams for their continued focus on safety and the local partnerships. Los Filos and Porcupine both achieved cyanide certification. This brings us now to six operations that are certified under the code and we're very proud of our leadership position on this initiative within the gulf sector. With that, I'll turn things over to Lindsay for financial highlights.
Chuck Jeannes: Lindsay, perhaps just if I can correct one thing that Steve said inadvertently. We expect to achieve or exceed guidance of 675,000 ounces at Red Lake during 2010.
Lindsay Hall: Thanks, Chuck. We're pleased to report another strong financial performance with record revenues and operating cash flows for the second consecutive quarter. Our average realized gold price increased by 3% to $1239 per ounce, which more than offset the 2% decrease in production. With our low byproduct cash cost of $260 per ounce we captured 79% of the gold price resulting in almost $470 million in cash flows before non-cash working capital changes in the quarter of $0.64 per share, a 21% increase over our second quarter results. These cash flows funded capital investments of some $238 million made at our mines and projects for the quarter. Also during and shortly after the quarter we received total consideration of some $880 million with the disposition of our San Dimas mine and our interest in terrain of which the cash portion of the proceeds amounted to $446 million. Getting into some of the details of the financial results for the third quarter, we had record revenues of $886 million and record earnings per mine operations of almost $400 million. We sold 568,100 ounces of gold at an average price of $1239 per4 ounce at an average cash cost of $260 per ounce realizing a record per ounce cash margin of $979 per ounce. Cash costs on a byproduct basis were $103 per ounce lower compared to the second quarter of $363 per ounce primarily due to higher byproduct credits and lower YMAD net proceeds payments. An important milestone was Pinasquito completing its commissioning and commencing commercial production on September 1 on schedule and within 10% of our budget. In our quarterly income statement we have recorded one month of financial results for Pinasquito. Our key performance indicators on a cost per ton basis are as anticipated and set up in detal in our MD&A. We continue to see improved economics as ramp-up proceeds. Also, as you know, production from Pinasquito's operations are sold in two concentrates, led and zinc, which are subject to provisional pricing. The provisional pricing impact during the third quarter related to these concentrates sold in the second quarter was a positive $2 million. At September 30 we have the following metals sold in the third quarter subject to provisional pricing: 9200 ounces of gold priced at $1307 per ounce; 1.2 million ounces of silver priced at $22.07 per ounce; 10.7 million pounds of led priced at $1.03 per ounce; and 22.9 million pounds of zinc priced at $0.99 per pound. Regarding the Alumbrera provisional pricing impact to our statement for copper during the third quarter, it also amounted to a positive $21 million. For the next quarter, 39 million pounds of copper priced at $3.64 per pound is subject to provisional pricing. As is our usual practice, you can find all the details of our hedging program as of September 30 in note 10 to our financial statements. For the quarter, adjusted earnings amounted to $231 million or $0.31 per share, a 15% increase over the second quarter. To calculate the adjusted earnings we add back to net earnings from $466.5 million the non-cash foreign exchange loss of $126 million, $15 million of unrealized non-hedged derivative loss, a $20 million operating loss related to terrain, which was disposed of in October, less the gain on disposition of San Dimas of $408 million. Consistent with previous quarters, we did not make any adjustment to adjusted earnings for non-cash stock option expense which amounted to $18.4 million or $0.02 per share. Lastly, just touching on the effective tax rate for the quarter, if one backs out from the book tax provision of $69 million for the quarter, the positive adjustment of $35 million related to the disposition of San Dimas, you'll get close to an effective tax rate for the quarter of 32%, which is our continued guidance for the full year. We ended the quarter with $732 million in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility fully available to us. Under the $1 billion Pueblo Viejo project financing obtained with Baird, approximately $100 million is available as additional draws to fund our remaining planned capital expenditures for the project. We continue into the next quarter with a strong balance sheet and remain confident in our ability to fund development of our mines and projects and the anticipated closing of our acquisition of Andean Resources before the end of the year. Great quarter, really good momentum moving into the fourth quarter both operationally and financially. With that, operator, I'll turn it back to you and open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Tony Lesiak - Macquarie.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: I was hoping you might provide some more detailed disclosure on Penasquito. Now that you have achieved commercial production, can you talk to some of the more specific concentrate terms, TCRCs and participation rates?
Chuck Jeannes: Tony, as we've said all along, and is the case with every company, those specific concentrate terms are subject to confidentiality with our sponsor partners. We've provided -- and it's on our website -- an average of those terms. I think we called it indicative pricing terms and it's got the payables, the per ton both smelter and transportation costs and I think that's very fulsome disclosure and we just can't give you the very specific details of each particular contract.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: Now in terms of the percentage of precious metals in the sulfide reporting to the zinc con for the lead con, can you tell that where that was in the quarter?
Chuck Jeannes: I'm passing that one to Steve.
Steve Reid: Tony, I know that the recoveries were reported in the disclosures there and you have them by metal. The thing that we've certainly been clear on is saying that please remember we're near the top of the orebody so we're in a transition between sulfide and oxide, so these are not necessarily indicative of the longer term. But I can give them to you if you like but, as I say, they're listed on the disclosure.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: Yes, I mean, they are relatively higher I guess in the second quarter. Have they come down?
Steve Reid: No, generally not. I mean, general zinc recoveries around 61. It was 63 before. Led is up a little at 65 and gold and silver are where we're expecting them. So, no, they're actually performing better than we predicted based on what we had considered a ramp-up as we go through this transition ore.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: But those are the overall recoveries. I was more interested in to which con they are reporting.
Chuck Jeannes: We'll dig that out and get it to you, Tony.
Steve Reid: As a corollary to that though, what I can say to you is that the concentrate quality is still sitting right where we expected it to be and within the guidance of what we provided before. We're still seeing a little bit higher silver than we were projecting but that's a good thing for us.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: On the unit operating costs, is there any further disclosure you can make in terms of where you see them trending to once you get to full production?
Steve Reid: What I would say is we're obviously looking for them to come down and as we get the throughput rates up that processing rate, for example, it's currently over $6. We want to get it well under $6.
Chuck Jeannes: I think, Tony, we're just working on budgets for the coming year and as we complete that we'll be able to give guidance certainly in the new year with respect to some of our expected costs for 2011.
Tony Lesiak - Macquarie: Well then just finally on the new manto discovery, can you give us some further specifics on that?
Chuck Jeannes: Just generally -- I just talked to Charlie about it recently. On a per ton basis it's about the same value as the discovery that we reported earlier on the other side of the Penasquito deposit. As a general rule -- and we've only got a few intercepts so far -- but it's lower gold and silver and much, much higher zinc. We've got some intercepts up to 16% zinc. So early days, we don't really know whether that is a trend that's going to apply over on the other side of Penasquito or whether it's just indicative of those particular holes. But that's the initial information.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: I was really pleased to see the doubling of the dividend and so I guess my first question is to Chuck. Has there been any change in the psychology of how you are approaching your dividend policy now? We understand that you obviously have a lot of free cash flow this current quarter, but it would seem that you're moving towards maintaining a competitive dividend policy vis-a-vis other gold companies and I was wondering if you could talk to that point.
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, actually, Jorge -- and thanks for your comments. We've always thought that it would be appropriate to deal with the dividend after we saw the big investment in Pinasquito get near the end and Penasquito working. It's such an important part of our cash flow for the coming years and important today and growing dramatically over time. So it's not that the policy has changed since the facts surrounding our company's performance that have kind of caught up with our ability to do something with the dividend. Certainly, being competitive with our peers is one factor but more is that based on an ability to pay and the confidence that we have that Penasquito is now essentially done and performing as expected.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank: Sorry, the second question was if you could just clarify, of your recent asset sales, you mentioned briefly in your introductory comments that there's still cash pending from Terrane. How much cash do you expect to collect in the fourth quarter from the recent asset sales and how much of your recent sales will be held in the form of marketable securities?
Lindsay Hall: Yes, Jorge, it's Lindsay. I think it's around $216 of cash. We've received it already. We closed I think a couple days ago, so that's sitting there. When you say marketable investments, all that cash is sitting in cash or cash like, so none of that has turned into any investments.
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, we received that cash plus about 8.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Thompson Creek Mining. I don't have that specific number
Jorge Beristain - Duetsche Bank: But that share in Thompson Creek, would that be counted under marketable securities or under long-term investments?
Chuck Jeannes: It'll be under marketable securities when you see the fourth quarter financials.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Chidley - HSBC.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: I just wanted to ask a few more detailed questions about Penasquito in terms of the recoveries. In terms of gold and silver, you say that you are on track and you're in the transition zone right now. What sort of -- long term what would you expect the sulfide recoveries to be again in terms of gold and silver on the sulfide mineralization then?
Steve Reid: Yes, Patrick, I know that as we've answered these in the past we've always said these things are extremely complex because of which rock type you're talking about and which concentrate you're expecting it to go to. In a general sense I can tell you that the assumptions that we've made and disclosed in the past -- and I’m trying to think of the dates, I think late 2008 thereabouts -- none of those have changed. So, I mean, just quickly if you recall it was quite a table based on the different concentrates and the different rock types and so on and none of those have changed. If you want me to give them to you I certainly can but there's a lot of them. It's more than, as I say, that's what we're building to and as we go through what is, in some cases, partly oxidized material we know that we're not going to get those recoveries, which are based on pure sulfide and so we're still heading towards those and we have no reason to suggest that anything's changing. In fact, the material's floating incredibly well.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Sort of another side of that same question then, next year, I mean, when do you expect to get out of the transition zone into pure sulfide and would we then see recoveries higher than where they are in the previous quarter?
Steve Reid: Yes, in general, that is the case. What tends to happen as you would expect with a multiphase pit is the deepest part of the pit will be in the fresher material and then there will be peripheral material where the stages are a little less advanced where we'll have some of that higher up contact material.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Just a couple of quick ones -- did you use a stockpile this quarter to supplement the sulfide feed?
Steve Reid: We may have but it would have been very minimal if at all, so not significantly.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Just seems that the tons processed were greater than the tons mined. It seemed to me you added in the sulfide and the oxide together.
Steve Reid: Yes, we are adding them together but yet there is stockpile material which we use for flexibility.
Patrick Chidley - HSBC: Then just finally on CapEx at Penasquito, seems like you're all but done on the $1.6 billion of CapEx for the project. You're basically done in terms of all the equipment on site and ramp-up for the HPGR. What remaining capital would you say going forward into next year, next few quarters I mean? Is there quite a high level of sustaining capital in the first year or so or is it going to drop off very much?
Steve Reid: The most significant thing coming in terms of capital is the in-pit crushing and conveying, which is going to be taking place over the next couple of years and, in total, that's round numbers $100 million to $150 million. But that's spread over a couple of years. So other than that, no, we're largely done and we're actually looking to focus on running what we've built.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Barnes - TD Newcrest.
Greg Barnes - TD Newcrest: Chuck, you mentioned in your comments at the beginning of the call about Eleonore, your increasing confidence as becoming a key cornerstone mine for Goldcorp. What are you seeing there that's making you say that?
Chuck Jeannes: Well, Greg, as we've been talking about for the last little while and I think the way I described it last quarter it was that we didn't really do a very good job of explaining early in the year that we announced to you a pre-feasibility study that had an average of 330,000 ounces of gold production over a 16-year mine life with cash costs below $400 an ounce on a co-product basis. There are no byproducts. So that's a nice mine. But that was based on a generation ago mineral resource of about 5.6 million ounces. At the same time we were doing the feasibility study we continued to drill and continued to remodel the resource and at year-end we were at a total resource of above 9 million ounces. So the effort throughout this year has been to update the feasibility study to accommodate that larger resources, and that means very significant work on the mine plan itself to arrange for mining and processing more tons of material. So my point is we don't have the numbers yet. We're working on that. We're going to be finalized at year-end and try to get this to our board as soon as possible. But we certainly expect the numbers that you saw earlier to be materially improved.
Greg Barnes - TD Newcrest: Just a second quick question -- your share holding in the [Cisco], do you see that as a strategic position now or is that something you would look to sell?
Chuck Jeannes: Well, I don't try to put labels on things. It's an interest that we've made a lot of money on. [Cisco] continues to do very well and we're pretty happy with our investment there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anita Soni - Credit Suisse.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse:  First question is for Lindsay. The provisionally priced lead amount, I missed that. It was at $1.03 but how much was it in millions of pounds?
Lindsay Hall: Yes, you want the pounds, Anita, right?
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Yes.
Lindsay Hall: It is at led we had 10.7 million pounds of led and 22 million pounds of zinc.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: At $0.99, right?
Lindsay Hall: That was what, Anita?
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Sorry, zinc was at $0.99?
Lindsay Hall: Zinc was at $0.99 and led was at $1.03.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Second question, with respect to the Andean acquisition, how much of the $1 billion that's available for cash payout has been taken up?
Chuck Jeannes: None. That decision, that election gets made by shareholders after the vote, the shareholder vote that takes place and then court hearing that will happen in early December. So there's a period following that where the election takes place. So it's not like a takeover where people can tender their shares along the way. It's more in the form of what we would call a plan of arrangement where it all happens following the shareholder vote and court approval. So just to clarify there, Anita, I said in my comments that we've generated cash that nearly pays for that entire $1 billion payment that is available for payment but until the time comes we don't know whether people will elect shares or cash and that, of course, will largely depend on how our shares are doing in the meantime and, therefore, the Andean shares on an exchange ratio basis.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Secondly or -- sorry, lastly, silver recoveries. I do know -- this is for Steve -- I did notice that the recovery rates on silver were trending down I think over the last three quarters I think at 55%. What is that attributed to and do you expect that to reverse?
Steve Reid: You're talking Penasquito here?
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Yes, Penasquito, sorry.
Steve Reid: Yes, basically there's nothing of concern to us there. In fact, as I say, we're actually hitting more silver than we were expecting in the concentrate, so I think it's a function of there being more silver and it's a function of the grade being up in this ore that we're seeing.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: So is that supposed to reverse around at any point or should we be seeing more actual silver actually report to the concentrate later?
Steve Reid: Yes, we're actually expecting that -- and much as I've explained as we're getting into the fresher ore, yes, we are expecting what we currently have as recovery rates to increase.
Anita Soni - Credit Suisse: Then lastly, reserve replacement as we go towards year-end and looking towards February, how do you see reserves panning out for this year in resources and how are they growing and will you be able to replace reserves?
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, Anita, again, we're just in process of calculating reserves based on drilling through the year and that will be coming out, as always, in late January, early February. I can tell you that we're feeling pretty good about it right now. We've had good success, as you're aware, at Musselwhite. We've had continued strong success as Los Filos. Actually, certainly the Red Lake high grade zone, both extending the zone at depth and laterally back up above the current mining levels and, of course, we'll have El Morro in to reserve this year for the first time. But even without regard to acquisitions I'm somewhat confident that we're going to be able to replace reserves on a company-wide basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Butler - Canaccord Genuity.
Steven Butler - Canaccord Genuity:  Question for you guys on Marlin, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the administrative process performed by the government. You alluded to I think a 120-day process. That timing I guess, Chuck, would put you to November 21 unless you think there is a date before that. Is that sort of on track for the delivery of a view from the government by mid to late November and we should therefore expect hopefully a clearing of the air on Marlin at some point thereafter?
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, as best we know, Steve, it's on track. It's not the kind of thing that the government is updating us every day in terms of how they're doing. That 120-day estimate was provided to us at the beginning of the process. I can just tell you that we continue to work very well with the government, very collaboratively. They're interacting with the commission itself, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and we think that that's gone positively. Nothing has changed in terms of the initial reaction that you got from the government that was publically stated by the president that they don't believe there were negative impacts to the environment or human health as a result of our activity. So we continue to work very hard on that issue and would like to get some resolution as well.
Steven Butler - Canaccord Genuity: Lindsay, going forward, you will equity account I think for San Dimas and will you show the 34% or 36% of production from San Dimas in your sort of consolidated production tables but simply equity account for the earnings from San Dimas?
Lindsay Hall: We'll certainly equity account for San Dimas. I’m not sure that we'll show the production from San Dimas in really what you are getting at, Steve, are guidance. So, no, as you saw in this quarter we've excluded anything to do with [primarily] sales that would constitute and equity portion of it. So the answer to your question is yes on equity accounting, no on recording its production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Bridges - JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: It may be a dumb question but I was just looking at your slide 24 and you helpfully break down the revenues on a percentage basis. But if I apply those to your site costs, then the costs seem to be skewed towards the base metals. There's something different going on there. I wondered if you could give us a bit of guidance as to how you can allocate costs in the co-product method.
Chuck Jeannes: This is in our slide, John, the byproducts and the co-product methodology?
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Yes, slide 24.
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, all that's happening there, John, is, as you know, the industry is that you just use gross revenues. So if you take the percentages that's the gross revenue that we're showing you that's being allocated. What we buried in there is the offsite costs and the 86, so you have to remove the offsite costs of the 86 in order to get the percentages working for you. But, for you, the percentages are what you want to use and that's the true gross revenues that we're using to allocate the cost.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: So the site costs are split on the revenues as given and then the off-sites are -- ?
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, all we're doing, John, is in the 86 we've netted the site costs in there but, yet, as you know, when you allocate on a co-product you exclude the effect of TRCs in allocation of those accrual costs against using the revenues to allocate the cost. It's a matter of trying to match the MD&A on that table with our preferred -- the industry-wide method of allocating costs, that's all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Christie - Scotia Capital.
David Christie - Scotia Capital: Just a quick question -- you hit another mantle on the other side of Penasquito pit and you have some pretty good ones on the opposite side. What is sort of the plans? You talk about it sort of supplementing production at some point? How are you going to get there and how quickly will it do that? 
Chuck Jeannes: Yes, it's not something that's going to happen, obviously, very quickly, David, because we'd have to build a shaft, an underground infrastructure and the like. Our goal now is to continue drilling and try to define enough of this material that we can then get the engineers to work and start putting together a plan. Steve?
Steve Reid: Chuck and I just said that initially the mantles were relatively small, albeit very high in value and we expected them to come near the end of the mine life. As we look now and start to think about a more significant contribution from them given that there's a potential for some sort of block caving underground operation already below the pit, the combination of the two is actually bringing it forward in our thinking and if the mantles are larger. So it's something that once we're now operating we'll start to look at the underground in more detail and see if we can bring it forward.
David Christie - Scotia Capital: One other sort of deposit you're looking at is the Camino Rojo there. What is the sort of plan for that as far as timing right now?
Steve Reid: We are looking to be exploring as soon as we possibly can. What we need to do, however, is come to an agreement with the local community there and there are a number of residual issues that we're still working through from the previous owners. But it's going very well but we're looking to be exploring through next year.
David Christie - Scotia Capital: So these are the (inaudible) the landowners?
Steve Reid: That's correct.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, so I will return the meeting back to you, Mr. Jeannes.
Chuck Jeannes: Thank you. I understand that the link to the slides was apparently not working for some of the viewers on the call and I apologize for that. Those slides are available on our website and certainly apologize for the technical difficulties and you not being able to follow along real time. So with that, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you've heard, we've got a significant amount of news flow coming over the next few months around our new projects and 2011 budget and new five-year plan, so stay tuned and we look forward to sharing our progress with all of you. Thanks for your continued interest and support. Good-bye.
Operator: Thank you. The conference call has concluded. You may disconnect your telephone lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-07-29 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Richard O'Brien - Chief Executive Officer, President and Executive Director Guy Lansdown - Executive Vice President of Discovery and Development John Seaberg - IR Brian Hill - EVP of Operations Guy Lansdown - EVP, Development Russell Ball - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Brian Hill - Executive Vice President of Operations
Analysts: Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co Heather Douglas - BMO Capital Markets David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc. Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc. Richard O'Brien David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: Okay. Then or at least I haven't gone through the whole MD&A section of the 10-K, but just wondering you indicated in your release that there was a lower grade as a result of ore dilution in Australia and New Zealand. I'm assuming that's some of your underground operations, and I'm just wondering what you want to tell us boat that dilution and whether this is something that should be anticipated going forward or not?
Brian Hill: Barry, it's Brian again. The issue that we had underground was really at the Tanami, and it really had to do with one large major stope that was the main source of production during the quarter. It had intersected a major fault zone in the hanging wall, and there had been some unraveling. That led to some unexpected dilution on grade coming out for the quarter from the Tanami. We're through and finished with that stope, but we've taken some learning from that operation and done some modifications to the stope geometries, access, etcetera. So that's not an issue that we expect to have going forward coming out of the Tanami.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: And then coming back to Boddington, because I'm not quite as convinced as John is. The costs that you're talking about here, now obviously, if you're getting more copper and less gold, that should actually help your byproduct costs the way you report it. And yet, that doesn't seem to be what's happening. And so I'm wondering you identified a couple of things, one being the Aussie dollar, one being the gold production, but there seems to be something else with respect to the high direct mining costs. And what you are seeing there that's going to change? Or, in fact, is that going to be a permanent higher cost going forward?
Richard O'Brien: So, Barry, let me start. First, please note that the cost estimates that we provided are on a co-product basis. They don't include the byproduct credit, and Brian can talk a little bit more about what we expect with respect to the byproduct credits.
Brian Hill: Barry, from the cost perspective, what we are seeing is we have been experiencing some higher wear, as I mentioned in the process plant, primarily in the primary and secondary pressures. So we've been seeing shorter life coming out of the bowls, mantles and other wear components. That's led us to be changing some of those out quicker and on shorter schedules than we'd originally expected. I guess what we are seeing is we are seeing that the average hours between change out are increasing. So just as everybody works through getting the right wear material, the right composition of wear material, I think we expect to see those numbers come down on wear in the plant. The high-pressure grinding rolls are wearing as expected, which for us we're really pleased about that. We expected to get around 5,200 hours on those and that's precisely what we're seeing. So we've had some wins in the process plant, and we're also seeing some wear issues there, which wasn't unexpected and we'd actually anticipated that. In the mine, what we've experienced is we've tightened up the drill pattern. We're really trying to get that optimum fragmentation size so that we can get the mine to mill process optimized. Our drill spacing is tighter. We've had to do more drilling than we've expected. We've also increased the powder factor. That's still a learning process we're going through, but that's one of the issues contributing to the higher cost. Another issue, too, is we've been trying to get the highest grade through the mine. So we've actually been going to more selective mining and more stockpiling and more re-handle coming off the stockpiles so we can really optimize the grade that we present to the primary crusher and into the plant. So those are really the principle components that have led to the higher operating costs.
Russell Ball: Barry, Russ. I'd just add we're into the wet season down there, and we spent a significant amount this quarter on road base and getting the roads in shape to get the truck productivity up. So those costs, while we will have an ongoing component of those, we had a big effort this quarter really to get the roads in shape. I'd also, Barry, just point you to your earlier question on buying co-products. If you look at Page 12 on the release, you'll see Boddington broken down on both a co-product and a byproduct and the 582 represents the co-product, as Richard said, byproduct it's about 503 for the quarter.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: Right. I just noticed that the byproduct was going up about as fast as the co-product costs certainly in your presentation there. Just coming back then for 2011, that was to be a plus million ounce year. Is a million ounces coming from Boddington not achievable in your opinion now going forward?
Richard O'Brien: Well, as we said in our release today, we've brought down the estimates based on what we're seeing to date in the model, and those are our best estimates at the current time. We will continue to do all of the extra work that Brian talked about and try to do everything we can to make sure that this grade issue is well defined and that we do the best job we can in the mine to reduce the amount of dilution. So really, as we do look into 2011, our current expectation is that Boddington will be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces. That's the level that we project today. I would say with only 2% of the reserves mined to date, all the data that Guy has talked about with respect to how we modeled this deposit initially and with the fact that most of this problem is really mining related, not processing related, I got to say, I hold out high hopes that we'll continue to work our way through this positively. I like to have the problems in the mine. That's what we're good at. We will figure this out. The processing plant is running well, and I think with that, I think the expectation is that we can push the processing plant up beyond nameplate capacity. And if we need to put more ore through the mill at a lower grade to get additional recoveries, I hope that that's the plan that we'll be able to put into effect.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: Okay. Then just to clarify then, Richard, so the production profile for Boddington next year has incorporated, say a 12% drop in grades that you anticipate could be recurring?
Richard O'Brien: Yes. That's our estimate for 2011.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Just following on from some of those interesting discussions on Boddington, with regard to the 12% lower gold, did you also increase the copper expectation by the 20% that you are anticipating?
Brian Hill: David, no, we haven't made that increase. That's really what we've seen on a historical basis so that hasn't been changed.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: One of the things that I'd noted was that the recoveries seem to be a touch better than what we had previously seen on some of your testing. Is that what you expect as well going forward?
Brian Hill: Yes, that's what we expect to see. We've got no reason to not doubt the improved recovery that we've seen so far.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: So should we be thinking about the 82%, 83% for gold as something going forward for recovery?
Brian Hill: Yes, I think that's a fair range to assume.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And in regard to copper, moving it up to perhaps the 84% level?
Brian Hill: That's a fair assumption as well, yes.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And I was listening to what Brian was saying with regard to some optimization. We had previously anticipated that there could be optimization of being able to process a lot more than the 2.9 million tons per month. Are you going to be looking at increasing the fleet?
Brian Hill: Yes, we are. As Richard mentioned, that's sort of part of this whole process that we're going through is looking at additional ways we can debottleneck the processing plant. What we really want to do is to get the bottleneck in the grinding circuit, and what we see is that we still got capacity in the grinding circuit and in the wet plant moving forward. And what we'd really like to do is be able to take advantage of that installed capacity, and we'll continue to work on looking at options to debottleneck to get that bottleneck into that part of the plant.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: All right. Now switching back to Batu Hijau, in the third quarter, can we expect a catch up in sales? Sales was lower than production. You had some 30,000 tons of con that had missed a shipment. Would we expect a catch up of that in the third quarter?
Russell Ball: Yes, David. It's Russ. Yes, that shipment has actually gone. Like I said, we had a vessel due in right at the end of the quarter, and there was some logistical challenges in whatever harbor it was in and so it showed up a little late. So those sales have already gone. So that will be caught up in the third quarter. As Brian mentioned, the rainy season generally comes mid-to-late October. So the function of the third quarter will be dependent and the fourth, quite frankly, on when the rain comes, but today it looks very good.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Because the third quarter does have a few things working for it. You've got the better grades that you've got access to, you've got the catch up of the sales and then you've got a positive reversal of the price participation.
Russell Ball: Yes, the mark-to-market that we saw at quarter end that hurt us about $0.06, we marked to $296. As I said, I think copper was trading $325 this morning so we'll get most if not all of that back and then some. So you're right, it should be good third quarter.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Now, Russ, while you're talking about the mark-to-market and participation, can you just walk us through how you ended up with the $0.62 downward provision?
Russell Ball: Yes, so we mark essentially the 90 to 120 days in concentrate sales that are outstanding at quarter end because of the contracts we have in place to the quarter end spot price, which is $296 and then the forward curve out to the next three, four months. So when we did that adjustment as the price was falling during the quarter, we recognized provisional sales, we market to that $296. So we essentially compared what we had on the books versus the spot price. Those price, the final price we'll get on those pounds of copper is a function of the price over that entire 90 to 120 day period. So you're taking an average. We took a point in time, which was close to the low, and you're now seeing the spot price go back up. So that average will climb. So that the final price we get is a function of obviously the date of shipment and essentially the average spot price over that 90 to 120 days. So you can see as copper prices climb, we'll get the benefit not only on sales in the quarter, but that mark-to-market coming through from what was receivable at the end of the quarter.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: How many tons of Con and copper were subjected to that swing during the quarter?
Russell Ball: It was 174 million pounds that we marked, and we can get you some more details, Dave, if you want, after on the exact mechanics of the calculation, and it is one that can impact the results. And is one that we just need to maybe educate and provide a little more information to you guys on because it is a big number at the end of the day, and it swings pretty quickly depending on volatile spot prices.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: And also in your reported $233 colors per pound received was a TC/RC. About how much of that was TC/RC?
Russell Ball: It's all TC/RC. So we paid the treatment charge and then a refining charge and it's built in, and that's been pretty consistent at levels you've seen in the quarter over the last couple of years. We net that against revenue so you don't actually see that as a cost. So if you look on Page 45 of the Q, you can see we had for the quarter $313 gross less the provisional we've been talking about of $0.62, gave us $251 and less treatment of refining charges of about $0.18 a pound. There's a flex component of that, and then there's also a price participation piece that's a function of copper price, and that's why you see it down over the previous year.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: Okay. And in the early commentary, I think Brian had mentioned encountering transitional ore in Yanacocha. I'm just wondering what the implications of that is going forward?
Brian Hill: David, that was we'd actually expected some oxide ore in the Yanacocha pit, which would've been projected to go on to the leach pad. The boundary, they encountered it a little higher up in the pit, and the ore proved to be transitional. So we can't put that on the leach pad, and what we do is, we actually need to run that through the mill. So that ore has gone into the transitional stockpile. So that will be processed through the mill in due course. So that was really just more if you want to call it a one-off event, as they were mining down through this last phase in the Yanacocha pit.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada: So will we see that then as potentially lower average grade going through the mill for the balance of the year?
Brian Hill: No, we won't because that probably won't be processed this year. Our plan has us moving back over into Chaquicocha and into El Tapado, where if you recall, last year, we did get higher mill grade ores coming out of those two pits. And so we're expecting to see the mill grade hold up over the balance of the year as we started to move into those two pits for Q3 and Q4.
Richard O'Brien: I think what it means David, as Brian pointed out earlier, is slightly higher costs at Yanacocha because we had to obviously pay the mining costs to put this into inventory or into stockpile, and it didn't go on to the pads. We're still anticipating we'll be within production and cost guide at Yanacocha, a bit of timing, a little higher into the cost range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: My question was more to do with, well you mentioned at the start of the call about your in-house growth opportunities and you mentioned that Leeville, Conga, etcetera, could account for, if I got this right, 45 million ounces of incremental gold proven and probable, of which only 30 million are booked, if I got that right, on your current PMP?
Richard O'Brien: What I said was that those opportunities could collectively represent 30 million to 45 million equity ounces, of which 20 million are in reserves today, that's correct.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: And so I was wondering of that net increase of 10 million to possibly 25 million equity attributable ounces, what do you consider the timing on realizing some of those because a lot of them are basically brownfield expansions?
Guy Lansdown: Jorge, this is Guy. Jorge, these projects are projected to be developed over the next four to five years, so we'd see progressively bringing it into place over the next say two to four years.
Richard O'Brien: And I would just say that I think in particular, if you look at somebody's projects like greater Leeville/Turf, which is one of the ones where we have a pretty high expectation of both delivery, as well as one of the wider ranges of the projects we have, we are doing quite a bit there today in terms of putting some additional drilling in place. As we talked about at investor day, we've authorized an additional 25 million of drilling to go into that project today, which Guy, you might want to just describe a little bit more about what we're up to out there.
Guy Lansdown: Yes. I can talk a bit more about Leeville/Turf. At Leeville, as we've said in the past, we've had some really good results in terms of trying to understand the wingspan, that horizontal extent of the deposit. And as we've said just to recap, in the process we see the potential to get up to 6 million ounces of reserve in NRM. As Richard said, we've looked at putting another $25 million of funding into this because of the great success we've had earlier in the year, and that would support 22 new surface holes that would extend the project 3,500 meters or two miles north and about 1,000 meters east and the west from the Leeville shaft. We've drilled six of those holes on the program, with the first three holes complete and results are still pending. But a lot of excitement around Leeville, and still trying to get our hands around what the bigger project looks like. While we're doing that, we're also looking at how to optimize this from a throughput perspective. Do we need more shafts? What's the best way to exploit the asset that we've got out there. So really excited about that one.
Richard O'Brien: And that's a project, which just to remind everybody it's representative of the kinds of projects we're looking to drive higher returns, and in Nevada where we already have infrastructure for processing, and these ounces would bring higher grade with them. It helps us to extend the life of our Nevada reserves, which as you know, if we can bring up the Nevada portfolio over people's expectations of the outward decline for Nevada, that brings up the whole foundation for the company. And there's a lot of good work with respect to costs that can happen as a result of higher grade deposits and the right chemistry, which Leeville provides us with out of Nevada.
Guy Lansdown: And I guess just to build on the projects that sit in that 30 million to 45 million ounces, we've got Conga and Akyem, of which big portions are in reserve already. Gold Quarry West Hall and greater Leeville/Turf at portions that are in reserve and NRM, but those are where we'd expect to see developing more reserve and NRM over the course of the next several years. The other bigger project is Hope Bay, of course, that's early stage and over the course, again, of the next several years we'd look at bringing those into NRM and reserve.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: Sure. I'm just trying to kind of dimension of the incremental of what's not counted in reserves right now, it would appear that you could pick up, if we assume about a 25-year mine life, 400,000 to 1 million incremental annual ounces based on these in-house or excess reserve internally identified opportunities. Am I thinking about that correctly of order of magnitude?
Richard O'Brien: Jorge, it's Randy. Now really, when you look at the total mix there between what we have coming out of the Nevada portfolio, what we have out of Conga and Akyem and Hope Bay collectively, there's probably 1.5 million to 2 million ounces of annual production across the entire advanced stage development portfolio. So when you're thinking, when you're trying to break it out between what's in reserve and what's in resource, there will certainly be a conversion effort with a good chunk of that conversion coming out of the ounces out of Hope Bay, as an example. But then over time, those will work their way into arguably incremental additional ounces as time goes on. But out of the gate, I think you should think about it in total as about 1.5 million to 2 million ounces.
Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG: And sorry to just keep questioning on Boddington, but just again, bit picture, conceptually Boddington in this current quarter was annualizing production at around 736,000 ounces. Your guidance, even though reduced for 2011, still implies a range of 775,000 as the midpoint, at least 5% higher maybe, 10% higher at the outside guidance rage. What is it that you're sort of pre-preparing for that would cause you to not expect significant fixed-cost dilution as you are able to optimize your production in that year? Are you pre-bracing for further issues from, for example, the Australian exchange rate or energy? Or do you believe that you're leaving a little bit of padding in the latest guidance that costs could surprise to the downside?
Richard O'Brien: Well, look, we're giving you our best estimate for today. It's a wider range because it's next year. We're only 2% of the way into this. I'd tell you, we've given you what we think is our best estimate, but as Brian has said, we are going to work hard, particularly in the mine to see what we can do to reduce dilution in the processing plant, to increase past nameplate capacity. And I would say, if you think a $0.90 exchange rate over the next several years and $80 oil is an appropriate assumption, that's what we've assumed. If you think it could be less than that, and there are certainly things we could do today to make it be less than that if we wanted to hedge part of our further hedge part of our exposure, we could probably bring that cost level down on some of those sort of fixed costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Christie.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Not to beat this with a pole here but just on the Boddington, a little more granularity for me maybe. On the model of grade versus what you're actually getting there, could you give me what the difference is between the two?
Guy Lansdown: We have said that we've got a 12% effective difference on gold from a contained gold perspective and 23% difference increase on the copper grade. That's overall, if you look at the ore that we've mined to date, the grade itself has reduced on the gold front from between 10% to 15%.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: You have both high-grade stringers in there. How often are you not seeing when you expect to see them?
Brian Hill: David, what we're seeing is we are seeing the high-grade stringers, but so far, with the relatively small amount of tonnage that we've mined. What we're not seeing is the level of continuity that we had expected to see. So that's really what the issue is on the higher grade. The model would have projected more continuity on some of the high-grade stringers when we actually get in and drill them down to ore control, spacings for blast holes, we're just not seeing the same level of continuity. But that doesn't mean that we may not see it come back again in the future, but that's just what we've experienced so far.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: But previous, the reserves drilling was done at what kind of spacing?
Brian Hill: 50 meters by 50 meters is the reserve drilling spacing.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: So that's not uncommon to find things aren't quite as continuous on a 50-meter block on stringer kind of zones. Okay. That's good. And what's the grade rate now in July? Can you give me what the grade is right now?
Brian Hill: I believe we're running at about a gram per ton in the first three weeks into July, David.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And what were you hoping for?
Brian Hill: Again, just that difference that Guy and others have spoken to, in the 15% range.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And at Yanacocha, you talked about it a bit already, so it's just basically higher grades coming from those couple of pits you were talking about there?
Brian Hill: That's right. We're moving into those pits in the second half of this year, and that's traditionally where we've experienced higher mill ore grades. And that's sort of what our expectation is over the second half of the year.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. So the second half of the year. What should the grade difference be between H1 and H2?
Brian Hill: It depends really on that mix because of leach to mill, but we expect to see, we normally run the mill ore grades are running sort of in that three to four gram per ton range. When we move into the other pits, what we've historically seen is running more in the range of five.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: Okay. So that's a pretty good change. Okay. And the leach side of it? Is that just more tons?
Brian Hill: Sorry?
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: The pad part of it is just more tons?
Brian Hill: Yes, the leach side would just be more tonnage.
David Christie - Scotia Capital Inc.: And what percentage increase are we talking about?
Brian Hill: Not a very significant increase because that's really been planned out on about the same basis in each quarter this year. We're not experiencing significant increase in leach tonnage placed. It's fairly well evenly spread over the year. Most of it will come from getting higher grade, and as we continue to debottleneck the mill, more tonnage through the mill.
Operator: Our last question comes from Heather Douglas.
Heather Douglas - BMO Capital Markets: So just one last week on with the new financial regulations in the U.S. I think the results in part about incremental disclosure about companies who list in the U.S. that operate in other countries. Can you give us a little bit of an overview of how this will or will not impact Newmont?
Russell Ball: Yes, Heather, it's Russ. We've been all following that through our D.C. office, and there's nothing in that legislation we don't do today. So from our impact, it's really de minimis. There's some additional reporting requirements, not only on gold but on a lot of the base metals, particularly around the DRC, those surrounding countries, not an issue for us. We already essentially publish what we pay so we actually welcome it, the transparency. So in this case, we're forcing more legislation, quite frankly
Heather Douglas - BMO Capital Markets: And then just a quick question, can you give us an update on the activity ongoing at Hope Bay?
Guy Lansdown: This is Guy. I can give you a quick update. We're currently on track with our Sealift, bit focus on the Sealift that comprises 12 barges, six tugs and three ships. We've got about 22 million liters of fuel and 20,000 of cargo, which is all scheduled to arrive at Roberts Bay in August/September. So we're going to have a very busy time up there, but in addition to that, key contracts were in place for the decline, which we anticipate starting later in the year, as well as the infrastructure construction. So that includes roads and camps. We've also completed 42 kilometers of drilling, and we'll continue to update our models and advance of our studies. So overall, we are very happy with the progress the project is making, and we're looking forward to making good progress as we go forward now.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you all very much for attending today and for accommodating our change in schedule. So we appreciate your attention and look forward to talking to you again either before or at next quarter end. So thanks again and have a great day, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning and thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. With me today are members of our executive leadership team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2, as we will be discussing forward-looking information, including outlook guidance, which cannot be guaranteed and is subject to a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com. And now I will turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John, and good morning. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, we will start on Slide 3 with an overview of the investment thesis for Newmont. First, our ongoing focus on execution and maintaining our operating track record has been and will continue to be job one for us. With consistent operational execution comes gold price leverage and strong cash flow generating capacity, which in turn, provides us with balance sheet strength and the flexibility to invest in our business. Delivering operating performance today provides us with the possibilities of the future. As we've described before, our current balance sheet and free cash flow generation afford us the ability to essentially pre-fund our $4 billion to $5 billion pipeline of advanced projects. Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a position of leadership in the areas of safety, the environmental and social responsibility, as well as employee development. These leadership positions are the cornerstone upon which our business continues to be built. Moving to Slide 4, as I noted before, our focus on dedication to operational execution is job one. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at cost applicable to sales of $492 per ounce, with our North American region contributing 36% of total quarterly equity gold production, South America contributing 14% and Africa contributing 10%. Our Asia-Pacific region contributed the remaining 40% of our quarterly gold production and the majority of our 80 million pounds of equity copper production.  Within our APAC region, our newest mine, Boddington, continues ramping up to full capacity and produced 184,000 ounces of gold and 15 million pounds of copper in the quarter. We are maintaining our overall outlook for full year 2010 gold and copper production, capital expenditures and gold operating costs within the original ranges we provided in February, although lower production at Yanacocha, higher cost ramp up production at Boddington, higher gold royalties and taxes, as well as adverse movements in the Australian dollar continue to put upward pressure on our costs, which suggest we'll end the year toward the top end of this CAS range. Turning to Slide 5, as I noted before, our strong cash flow generation, coupled with over $6 billion of liquidity, affords us considerable flexibility to profitably develop our business and generate returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we generated $753 million of operating cash flow, up about 50% over last year and $434 million of free cash flow. For the first two quarters, we generated a total of approximately $1.5 billion of operating cash flow and $875 million of free cash flow. As you may have also seen earlier this week, Moody's upgraded our senior debt rating from a rating of BAA2 to BAA1. As this slide highlights, we intend to continue to invest our free cash flow and available liquidity in a combination of project development, exploration and value-oriented acquisition opportunities. In addition to investing in our business when our liquidity and free cash flow generating capacity allows, we will also look for opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Today, we are pleased to announce that the board has approved a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, or an indicated annual dividend of $0.60 per share, effective September 29. We believe that our business is strong enough to both reinvest capital at attractive returns and offer higher dividends in a higher metal price environment, which we feel positions us uniquely in the gold equity market, as well as against the gold ETF. As we discussed during our investor day in Boston, we're intent on providing investors with a sustainable range of gold and copper production over time that offers current and ongoing exposure to gold price, as well as competitive financial returns. We continue to see numerous internal attractive project development opportunities. Akyem and Conga, along with Hope Bay, Greater Leeville/Turf and Gold Quarry West Wall collectively represent up to 30 million to 45 million equity ounces of potential reserve and resource development, of which approximately 20 million are currently in proven and profitable reserves. We believe the combination of our pipeline of projects and our exploration portfolio will continue to allow us to extend the lives of our operating regions for many years to come. I'll now turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will provide further details on our second quarter results.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Richard. Good morning, all. Moving to Slide 6, as Richard previously mentioned, equity gold production for the quarter was approximately 1.3 million ounces, an increase of 10% and at an average realized gold price of $1,200 an ounce, an increase of 31%. Gold operating margins expanded 44% to $708 an ounce, despite a 16% increase in operating costs. Moving to Slide 7. I wanted to spend a little time discussing the reasons for the increase in operating costs. As you can see on the waterfall, lower production at Yanacocha, where we encountered unexpected transitional wall that was stockpiled for future processing through the mill and higher cost production at Boddington, which Brian Hill will cover shortly, were the primary drivers of higher costs for the quarter. Higher silver byproduct credits offset some of the cost increases, which you can see represented on that waterfall. Turning to copper on Slide 8. Production increased 56% to 80 million pounds as a result of Phase V mining at Batu Hijau and the ramp up at Boddington. The average realized copper price of $233 per pound improved by 7% from the year-ago quarter, but included a provisional pricing adjustment of $0.62 a pound. Higher operating costs were due to higher milling costs at Batu Hijau and higher cost Boddington production coming online. Moving to Slide 9. For the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 38% increase. Net operating cash flow from continuing operations was $753 million, a 49% increase, and adjusted net income rose to $377 million or $0.70 a share, an increase of 79%. For the quarter, reported net income was negatively impacted by a couple of items. You might have noticed we had a higher effective tax rate of 33.6% versus 29.6% in 2009 and approximately 15% in the first quarter. The difference of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter impacted earnings per share by about $0.07 a share. Notwithstanding a higher tax rate this quarter, our effective tax rate for 2010 remains unchanged at between 24% and 28%. We had a copper provisional pricing adjustment, as previously mentioned, of about $79 million, which impacted earnings per share by about $0.06 a share.  We marked to market at quarter end at $296 a pound. I think this morning checking earlier, copper was trading around $325, so we will see most of that come back in the third quarter. And finally, we had a delayed shipment of about 30,000 tons of copper concentrate from Batu Hijau that was scheduled for quarter end, and it got rolled into the third quarter, which impacted earnings by about $0.03. So you can see the impact of that on the second quarter, and most of that will come back in the third quarter. So when you step back and look at it, I think the key job for us to deliver significant gold price leverage to the bottom line and that's what you saw in the quarter. We had a 79% increase in earnings per share on a 31% increase in average realized gold price. I will now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Russell. As you can see on Slide 10, North America produced 463,000 ounces of gold, up 4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to higher production at La Herradura due to commencement of production in the new Soledad and Dipolos pits, as well as underground increases at Midas and Leeville. This was offset by lower leached ore production and reduced production as a result of the Gold Quarry Slide. Costs applicable to sales were $585 per ounce, up 9% due to a higher proportion of underground mining and additional surface costs due to the Gold Quarry Slide. We continue to expect North America to produce between 1.7 million and 1.9 million ounces of gold for the year within our original CAS outlook range of $575 to $615 per ounce.  In South America, we produced 181,000 equity ounces, a decrease of 32% from the prior year. This decrease is due to lower mill ore grade and recovery, combined with lower leach tons placed due to the stockpiling of transitional ore. Costs applicable to sales were $389 per ounce, up 20% from 2009 due to lower production, higher waste mining and higher maintenance costs, production taxes and royalties as a result of the higher gold price. We anticipate Yanacocha to have a strong second half. South America is on track to produce between 750,000 and 810,000 equity ounces of gold for the year. However, we believe CAS may come in at the high end of the original outlook range of $360 to $400 an ounce due to lower than expected leach tons placed and silver byproduct credits. In Africa, we produced 132,000 ounces, a slight decline from 2009 due to lower grade and recovery as we have moved out of the Subika pit and into the Apensu and Awonsu pits, offset partially by higher throughput. Costs applicable to sales decreased 3% to $416 per ounce due to lower milling costs, partially offset by higher fuel costs. We are pleased to report we have increased our outlook for full-year production at Ahafo to between 500,000 and 530,000 ounces, and our costs applicable to sales outlook has been lowered to between $475 and $515 per ounce as we are seeing higher grades than projected. In APAC, we produced 522,000 equity ounces of gold, a 64% increase over 2009, primarily due to production at Boddington, which was not in production during the second quarter of 2009. Additionally, we benefited from higher production at Batu Hijau. Costs applicable to sales in Asia-Pacific were up 17%, primarily due to higher cost production from Boddington during the ramp up, a stronger Australian dollar and lower production at the Tanami due to mill availability issues. Moving to Slide 11, as Richard mentioned, we continue to ramp up production at Boddington, having declared commercial production in November 2009. For the second quarter, gold production increased 16% from the first quarter of 2010 to 184,000 ounces, and copper production increased 13% to 15 million pounds. The processing plant continues to perform in line with our expectations and should achieve nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. In the first three weeks of July, we saw the plant operating at approximately 97% of capacity. However, costs applicable to sales have been higher than anticipated due to a stronger Australian dollar and higher than expected mining costs during the ramp up. On Slide 12, now that we are several months into the ramp up, we wanted to give you an update on some of the positives and challenges since we started delivering ore to the plant last year. On the positive side, recoveries for both gold and copper have exceeded feasibility study estimates to date. We have also mined 23% more contained copper than modeled, with higher-quality concentrate helped by better than anticipated performance by the high-pressure grinding rolls and the wet plant. However, we have encountered approximately 12% lower than modeled contained gold thus far, offset somewhat by 23% more contained copper. In addition to in the dry plant, we are seeing higher wear in the primary and secondary pressure circuits than we expected. We have also seen mining costs higher than expected due to increased costs related to drilling and blasting and stockpile re-handling. As a result, equity gold production for 2010 is now expected between 750,000 and 825,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales on a co-product basis of $475 to $550 per ounce. For the reasons just discussed, we believe we will achieve the 2010 copper production outlook of between 65 million and 75 million pounds. We now believe copper costs applicable to sales could be between $1.55 and $1.75 per pound. Looking ahead to 2011, as the mine begins its first year of steady-state production, we expect equity gold production at Boddington to be between 850,000 and 925,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $475 and $525 per ounce, which we believe to be conservative given the expected increase in production. Beyond 2011, our outlook for Boddington's operating performance is subject to further data collection and analysis as we gain more experience with the mine. I want to highlight the fact that we have only mined 2% of the reserves of this 20-plus year mine life asset, and feel that it is too soon to draw conclusions on the long-term impact of the model reconciliation experience during ramp up. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to give a brief discussion on Batu Hijau. The second quarter was anticipated to be a strong quarter as we began to access higher grade ore from the bottom of Phase 5 in the traditional dry season. As you can see from this photo taken on April 25, we experienced unseasonably heavy rainfall during the quarter, limiting our access to the bottom of the pit and requiring us to produce from lower grade stockpiles. We believe that we should be able to make up this delayed production in the second half of the year, assuming a normal dry season pattern and are maintaining our original production outlook.  As an update to our ownership position, no shares were divested during the quarter, and our effective economic interest remains at 48.1/2%. We offered the final 7% ownership stake for sale in March, and negotiations of the purchase price are still underway with the Central Government. So what does this all mean for our full-year outlook?  As you can see on Slide 14, our portfolio continues to perform as we continue to expect full-year gold production in the range of our original outlook of 5.3 million to 5.5 million ounces. However, we are tightening our outlook for CAS to the narrow range of $460 to $480 per ounce based on the factors we've already spoken about. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Brian. Turning to Slide 15, I want to reiterate that safety, environmental stewardship, sustainability and leadership in corporate social responsibility remain the hallmarks of our business, and we believe these attributes offer us a competitive advantage. For the third consecutive year, we've been selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We're also ranked 16th overall on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list co-filed by Corporate Responsibility Magazine., and Newmont is the sole mining company featured in the top 20. In addition, in May, we were announced as the winner of 2010 Global Business Coalition Award for our Workplace Malaria and HIV/AIDS program in Ghana. And just in the past few weeks, Newmont was awarded the 2010 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. This is the highest honor presented by the U.S. Government to employers who provide outstanding support to employees serving in the Guard and Reserve. We're very proud to support our employees who dedicate their time and effort to the Reserves and to our country, and we appreciate the government's recognition of our employee support. Turning to the last slide, in summary, we continue to generate significant free cash flow in the strong metal price environment. We're pleased to be in a position to increase cash returns to our shareholders in the form of a dividend increase, as well as to continue to drive sustainable longer-term returns, through developing our most prospective projects, continuing to fund exploration opportunities and considering strategic value-oriented M&A transactions. We do anticipate a strong second half of the year as we continue to focus on execution, and we are confident that we can once again deliver on our annual guidance for production, costs applicable to sales and capital expenditures, generating operating cash flow that is leveraged to gold price and allows us to reinvest in our business and return cash to shareholders. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening and open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Bridges.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Congratulations on raising the dividend. That's a great sign of confidence and I just wonder if we're headed into the old-fashioned bumper Q4 result that we got used to from Newmont?
Richard O'Brien: No, I don't think it's going to be the bumper fourth quarter results. I think with the ramp up of Boddington, with higher leach pad placement at Yanacocha and with Batu really coming into the dry season, I think all of those things over the next two quarters will really put us in the position where we're going to deliver on the year. We will see some ramp up towards the year end. We have had the traditional second quarter shutdown of one of our mills in Nevada, but I don't think it's that traditional fourth quarter big push. This is all well within our plan.
John Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. I'm glad to hear it. Just wondered with the grade issues at Boddington, after having gone through this situation with Phoenix, I just wondered if you can still compare and contrast that situation with this?
Richard O'Brien: I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Guy. First I would say this is a project Boddington, which has been really well within Newmont and previous to that, Normandy's control, and I think based on a lot of data that we have analyzed over time and had many others analyze, I got to tell you, I'm very confident with the work we did in modeling and the reserve work we've done, as well as the design of the process plant. And first and foremost, we had processing issues at Phoenix from day one. We have not seen that at all from Boddington. In terms of recoveries, we're seeing very good recoveries out of the mill at Boddington. We didn't see that when we started up Phoenix. With respect to the reserves and model, I'll turn it over to Guy.
Guy Lansdown: John, just to talk about Phoenix, I believe Boddington is not at all like Phoenix, and there's many important differential. First of all, Phoenix experienced a number of issues related to the oxide zone. There was a much bigger oxide zone in the Phoenix deposit that caused problems in the mill. The mill wasn't designed to handle that. At Boddington, all of our material is primarily sulfide so we're not going to see that issue. Phoenix had a significant amount of historical data in non-core drilling that has proved be biased, and that led an overestimation of gold. At Boddington, most of the drilling is being completed under the control of Newmont and its partners. And finally, Phoenix has coarse gold that led to estimation issues and difficulties in ore control misclassification. The deposit type at Phoenix is SCRUM and those are notoriously difficult to model and predict. Boddington is not a SCRUM deposit, and while coarse gold does exist, the gold particle size is much finer and it doesn't make up as large a percentage of the contained metal as it did at Phoenix. Also building on what Richard said, there's been a tremendous amount of work done on the model itself. There's a number of work done by many, many different sources. We've got a strong underlying drill hole database that we've had numerous external audits and continuous QA/QC programs. The data is dominated by core drilling, which had excellent recovery and check assays during the course of the feasibility study suggested that the database was actually conservative. Now just building on the reviews that have been done, we had 10 external reviews during the feasibility study and eight external reviews since that time. Numerous internal reviews by Newmont and, of course, we had our partners Newcrest and Anglo involved at the same time. So in addition to that, we mine test pits early on, which demonstrated the grade should have been above expectation. Additionally, it's a very large deposit, it's very well drilled and it should be robust, and I have to reemphasize that it's still very early days with only 2% of the ore body mined to date. But we've got a much better database and much more confidence in the underlying data for this deposit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Barry Cooper.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: First on Batu Hijau, basically when you adjust for your ownership, Q2 was actually better than Q1. So I'm wondering you've made some cautionary statements there that it wasn't a very good quarter relative to what you were expecting. So what should we expect then for Q3? And is the water still in the pit or are we all dried out at this point in time?
Brian Hill: Barry, it's Brian. What we had to do in Q2 with the unseasonable rain, we had is without having access to the bottom of the pit, we ended up having to pull most of the ore off of lower grade stockpiles. So that led to lower than what we had expected production to be for Q2. The pit is dry. We are now operating in the bottom of the pit. The other thing that we've also started is we've also started all of the dry season work, including the work we can do now that we have the pinjim cokeye [ph] [12:13] to be in position for stripping in Phase 6 and all the other drainage work and re-diversion work around the pit that we need to do so we can get stripping going in Phase 6.
Richard O'Brien: So Barry, I'd just summarize by saying I think Brian and the team felt at the end of the first quarter that we'd probably be ahead of our estimates for the year just based on first quarter performance, and now it looks like we're probably more likely to be right on our estimates for the year.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets Inc.: So what kind of grades are you encountering there say for the month of July?
Richard O'Brien: I don't have the answer to that. We'll come back to you with that. Sorry, Barry, John will come back to you.

Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today’s conference. (Operator instructions) I’d like to inform all parties this call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.
John Seaberg: Good morning and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. With me today are the members of our executive leadership team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we begin, I’d like to refer you to our cautionary statement on slide two, as we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com. And now I will turn it over to Richard O'Brien, our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. For those of you with access to our webcast presentation, I’d like to begin on slide three. With our average realized gold price up 22% to $1,106 per ounce and our average realized copper price up 97% to $3.33 per pound from the first quarter of 2009, our first quarter operating cash flow increased from $381 million to $728 million. Our revenues also rose, increasing from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion while our adjusted net income improved from $199 million to $408 million. As these financial results clearly indicate, we continue to offer investors substantial gold and copper price leverage. As shown on slide four, we also continue to meet our operating targets. During the first quarter of this year, we produced 1.3 million equity ounces of gold and 90 million equity pounds of copper, with cost applicable to sales of $480 per ounce of gold and $0.78 per pound of copper. For the year, we continue to expect gold cost applicable to sales of between $450 to $480 per ounce. In 2010, we are experiencing pressures relative to our full year 2009 CIS [ph] of $417 per ounce, primarily driven by lower production volumes in Nevada, Peru, and Ghana, and as a function of higher cost underground production at Nevada and higher mill production at Yanacocha. The lower cost production from Boddington should offset some of these operating costs, as we ramp up the full production towards the end of this year. Additionally, the remaining third of the year’s increase over last year in CIS I is a result of higher gold prices and an unfavorable Australian dollar exchange rate. Despite these operating cost pressures, we continue to expect full year performance in line with our existing outlook. We continue to advance our development projects with encouraging results. During the first quarter, we made progress with our engineering, optimization, permitting, and community relations (inaudible) Conga, Akyem, Hope Bay, and Nevada projects. Collectively, these opportunities currently represent up to $30 million to $40 million targeted equity ounces, a potential reserve and resource development opportunities, approximately $20 million of which are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could grow with positive exploration results over time. Our first quarter financial and operational results speak to the strength of our commitment to execution and increasing our financial returns, as well as to the dedication of our employees around the world to deliver safely on our plans and provide the highest value to our shareholders. Moving to slide five, we remain bullish on metal prices. Robust fundamentals, including evidence of a rebounding jewelry market in India and growth in the jewelry market in China, plus sustained industry inflows and historically low Central Bank sales continue to support gold price performance during the first quarter of 2010. On the supply side, European and Central Bank sales were near zero, while Russia brought approximately 8 tons of gold in the first quarter, as it continues its gold purchasing program. With Central Bank sales essentially non-existent and some countries actually buying gold, extra supplies not being pushed into the market causing supply to tighten even further. In addition to these factors, we believe mine supply will also remain constrained due to declining grades on a global basis. On the demand side, many developing economies are recovering faster than the developed counterparts, especially in countries like India and China, which are key markets for gold consumption. The continued recovery of these developing nations should have a positive impact on gold demand. In addition, medium-term concerns surrounding sovereign debt rates in some regions are likely to favor gold, as investors put their trust in gold rather than currency. Overall, investment interest in gold remains very strong, as demonstrated by a record high for the amount of gold held by ETFs reached in the first quarter. In copper, we believe a strong pricing environment will continue to be driven by a revival of consumption both in the West and in China. Additionally, the tight copper concentrate supply will likely keep upward pressure on pricing as demonstrated by relatively low smelter processing charges. I’d now like to turn the presentation over to Russell Ball, our CFO, who will get further into the details of our quarter.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Richard, and good morning all. For the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, a 46% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Net operating cash flow was approximately $728 million, a 91% increase over 2009. And our adjusted net income rose to $408 million or roughly 105% increase over the first quarter of 2009. Higher gold and copper prices and significantly higher copper production from our assets in Indonesia were a most significant contributors to the increase in net income. Turning to slide seven, equity gold production was approximately 1.3 million ounces, and average realized gold price was up 22% to approximately $1,100 an ounce. While the cost applicable to sales increased approximately 11% to $480 an ounce, gold operating margin expanded by 32% to $626 an ounce. On a year-over-year basis, CIS increased from $431 to $480 an ounce, primarily due to lower production as a result of the slide late in the fourth quarter of 2009 and higher mining costs in Nevada. Lower production, higher waste mining, higher royalties and workers participation at the Yanacocha, and finally, from the ongoing ramp-up at Boddington. As Richard mentioned earlier, for the year, we have maintained gold production and operating cost guidance despite a change on gold price assumption to $1,100 an ounce and now – or the dollar assumption to $0.90, which collectively add between $15 and $20 per ounce. The TFO more than happy to pay these increased operating costs, given the positive increase in operating margins and free cash flow that accrues. Turning to slide eight, copper production increased 143% to 90 million pounds with an average realized price of $3.33 per pound, an improvement of 97% from the year-ago quarter. Copper production was up significantly due to the fact we are in Phase V mining at Batu Hijau this year. We will essentially complete Phase 5 mining at Batu Hijau this year, as stripping for Phase 6 will begin in earnest in 2011. Cost applicable to sales decreased 12% to $0.78 a pound resulting in a 219% increase in our copper operating margin. As you will see on slide nine, gold margin for the quarter increased by a third to $626 per ounce despite the higher costs applicable to sales. When factoring in copper byproduct revenue as copper credits, cash operating margin increases from 58% to approximately 78%. This leverage to gold and copper prices demonstrates our ability to generate significant cash flow from our existing production base of approximately 5.3 million ounces. I would now turn it over to Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to discuss our regional operating results for the quarter.
Brian Hill: Thanks, Russell. As you can see on slide 10, each of our four regions performed essentially in line with expectations in terms of gold production, with North America’s production being just a little bit higher than what we were expecting. Costs applicable to sales were slightly higher than expected in North America due to higher underground mining costs, higher production taxes, and lower byproduct credits in Nevada. At Yanacocha, costs applicable to sales were higher than anticipated due to higher milling costs. Lower production from the leach pads, higher workers participation, and royalty costs related to the higher realized gold price and lower byproduct credits. Costs applicable to sales at Ahafo in Ghana were slightly lower than expected due to lower power costs and lower mining costs. Costs in the Asia-Pacific region were essentially in line with expectations of higher cost production from Boddington as a result of lower than expected gold grades was offset by lower cost production at Batu Hijau due to lower mining costs and a lower allocation of costs to gold. The other operations in Australia and New Zealand performed as expected. In summary, the portfolio is working and we continue to expect equity gold production for the year of between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces and costs applicable to sales of between $450 million and $480 per ounce. Turning to slide 11, I’m proud to give you an update on the ramp-up of Boddington. As a reminder, Boddington achieved commercial production in November of last year, and the first quarter of 2010 represents just the first full quarter of commercial production. For the first quarter, gold production increased 34% to 158,000 ounces and copper production increased 40% to 14 million pounds from the fourth quarter of 2009. We are in the process of commissioning the fourth course ore screen that was installed late in the first quarter, and that’s progressing as planned. Overall, our gold and copper recoveries have continued to be stronger than our existing mine plan. However, we have experienced some volatility in our ore grades, resulting in lower than expected gold grades and higher than expected copper grades as we continue to reconcile the block model with our tool production. Our site operation and commissioning teams continue to improve plant performance. The concentrator throughput is performing as expected and at levels consistent with the 12-month ramp-up schedule. And as of the end of the first quarter, total tons mined from the pit are within 10% of the current mine plan. We are hosting a site tour at the end of September, and we hope to see many of you there where we can show you more of the operation firsthand. I also wanted to briefly mention the earthquake that we experienced near our KCGM operation last week. The 5.2 magnitude earthquake caused us to temporarily suspend operations for the safety of our employees and contractors. There were no injuries and no significant damage to our operations, and normal operations resumed the following day. Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery & Development, will now give you a brief update on our major projects.
Guy Lansdown: Thanks, Brian. As you know, we are very excited about our pipeline of projects that we anticipate will bring between 30 million and 40 million targeted ounces to production in the coming years, of which approximately 20 million ounces are currently in proven and probable reserves, which could go with positive exploration results. We won’t get into too many details on the full extent of our project pipeline on this call. For that, we look forward to discussions with you at our Investor Day presentation on May the 27th with the intent to deep dive our projects in each of our regions. Slide 12 shows our major projects in each of our regions. As we indicated last quarter, we are advancing development of the Hope Bay district with an underground focus of the Doris north deposit. We have increased this year’s funding for this program to between $180 million and $200 million, accelerating 2010 construction and development activities. As a result, we have increased our 2010 outlook for advanced projects R&D spending to between $230 million and $250 million, up from $185 million to $210 million. We are currently deploying supplies for this program from multiple ports on the East and West Coast in a carefully coordinated sealift, supporting development of additional surface infrastructure and (inaudible). We are executing development and exploration drilling programs in parallel, with 18,000 meters of drilling completed so far this year, and early results supporting our resource expectations. Although we are in the early stages, we remain energized about the opportunity and the experienced team and key contractors we now have in place on the significant assets. I also want to congratulate the Hope Bay team for recently celebrating two years without a lost time accident, over 1.2 million man hours as of April the 20th of 2010. At Conga, we had a very successful public hearing on March the 31st of this year, with over 4,000 people participating in the event, including national and local government officials, farmers and other members of the community. In addition, we continue to build the Conga development team and trade execution strategies while advancing engineering. Our Akyem project in Ghana is expected to complete the stage 4 (inaudible) in the second half of 2010, with production still targeted for late 2013 to 2014. Following the receipts of the mining lease in January, negotiations with the local communities regarding land access and crop compensation continue. And we have now got 70% completed engineering work. We are also excited about the Subiaco expansion where we currently have identified a target of approximately 7 million to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million are in proven and probable reserves. We are advancing simultaneously surface and underground development programs. Our exploration and development team made good progress, advancing approximately 500 meters a day, and we have completed 8,000 meters of exploration drilling this year. Turning to slide 13, as part of our Nevada portfolio, we have excellent new explorations results (inaudible) project that provides a possibility to double our current reserve with potential to expand within and beyond the footprint shown on the slide. In an effort to better understand the potential of this core asset, we have been executing in parallel a surface drill campaign and drilling from underground platforms with approximately 20% of this program completed so far this year. We drilled approximately 15,000 meters from surface in 2009 with the intent of better understanding the full extent of the orebody. The results of this program will be an exceptional. To highlight a few results, I would turn your attention to the map on the right. On the north end of the map, 1,000 meters beyond our end of 2009 and our reserve footprint, we have anticipated 10 meters of 13 grams per ton in the drill hole called CGXH. This combined with multiple favorable insights to the south suggest potential to expand underground minable mineralization well beyond current levels. In addition, I would highlight the drill hole called CGX-2 where we intersected 10 meters of 22 grams per ton, roughly 250 meters to the list of previously modeled Leeville mineralization. We are excited by these new expansion discoveries in our core Nevada assets and plan to increase funding for additional inflow and step-up drilling. I’m now going to pass the mike back to Richard for an update on our Batu Hijau ownership.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Guy. As previously announced, we recently completed the sale of the 2009 portion of the divestiture shares under our contracted work at our Batu Hijau operation in Indonesia. As you recall, in the fourth quarter, we obtained a 17% effective equity ownership interest in PTNNT as a result of a loan made to our Indonesian equity partner. As you see on slide 14, at year-end, we directly own 35.44% of Batu Hijau through our NTP investment with Sumitomo. Adding the 17% collateral ownership, our year-end 2009 economic ownership is 52.44% and we held that interest throughout the first quarter. In March, we finalized the sales of 2009 divestiture shares, which reduced our effective ownership position to 48.5%, which is where it stands at the end of the quarter. As a result of this sale, we’ve adjusted downward our 2010 outlook for equity copper production to between 330 million to 360 million pounds, down 20 million pounds more to previous outlook. One final divestiture tranche remains outstanding, which is the final 7% of the PTNNT that was offered for sale on March 31, 2010. The offer price was $444 million for the 7%, or approximately $6.3 billion on a 100% basis. Once the sale closes presumably sometime later this year, our economic ownership will decline to 44.56%. At that time, the divestiture process would be complete. Turning to slide 15, I’d like to reiterate that Newmont continues to perform well operationally and financially while simultaneously continuing to strive to maintain our leadership position in safety, sustainability and community relations. For the third consecutive year, we were selected Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, an accomplishment of which we are very proud. We also achieved International Cyanide Code Certification at all of our mines, except at Boddington where we are still to ramp up and where we should start to receive the certification in 2011. We are in the implementation phase of our community relations review, which we envision as our roadmap to uniform and industry-leading community relations throughout the world, and we have created our global carbon management team to help us navigate through the responsibilities of being a good global citizen through management of our carbon footprint. In closing, we had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance. And we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on what we say we will deliver. We continue to generate significant cash flow today from our gold and copper production, combined with the relentless focus on cost containment and margin expansion. We are in the process of executing on our business excellent program, which is expected to create significant value, additional value across our regions, functions, and the operations over the next three years. We are aggressively advancing our project pipeline as well as investing in our exploration program to develop our operating assets of the future. We’d be giving a lot more detail on these efforts at our Investor Day presentation on May 27th in Boston, for which we hope many of you can join us either on person or via the webcast. I’d like to express my thanks to our dedicated employees and contractors for another outstanding quarter. And with that, operator, I’d like to thank you all for listening and turn it back to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from John Bridges.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Thanks, Richard and everybody. And congratulations on the results. I just wondered if you could give us a bit of clarification on the fine tuning of Boddington in respect of the grades of the gold and the copper. And maybe some sort of percentage breakdown as to how you expect the ramp-up to go during this year.
Richard O'Brien: Yes. Let me just introduced by reminding that we are in ramp-up. We are one quarter – one full quarter into it, and as the slide showed, about 4.5 months, because we really started in November. So with that, Brian can talk a little bit about it. I’d say, the expectation for ramp-up is that, as we’ve said, we expect to be in full production towards the end of the year and we will be ramping up along the way. It will be a little volatile back and forth, and I think that includes both tons and grade and output. So Brian, do you want to add a little bit to that?
Brian Hill: Yes. Thanks, Richard. John, I think if you recall, we’ve said we were looking at about a 12-month ramp-up period to get to 100% production. So we are hoping to get there around the third quarter of this year on a basis over Q1. We are actually running the plant at about 70,000, 75,000 tons, which is getting close to that 70%, 75% of capacity. And that’s essentially on target with where we are at. We are extremely pleased and happy with how the plant has ramped up. With respect to your question around the grades, for us it’s still early days. As we’ve said, we are just sort of one quarter into full production. We’ve got a number of different geological domains that we are mining. And as we mine those and reconcile them to the model, it’s really when you get actual production that we can go back and actually see how we are doing. So as we said, we are slightly – we are slightly down on the gold grade and up on the copper grade. And I think we still need to get a couple more quarters under our belt with mining and some of the different domains to be able to come back with some more definitive answers around the reconciliation. A couple of things that we have done is we did put the fourth course ore screen in. We did leave space to be able to do that because we always knew that the dry plant might be an area where we needed to increase capacity. We are also bringing in our sixth secondary crusher, sixth MP1000. The space was left to bring that in. And these are really to help increase the rate at which we get up to full production, and in fact, they are going to allow us probably to go over a name plate capacity, as we get towards the end of this year and into 2011.
Richard O'Brien: So, John, I’d just add, as we go into the year, we will continue to provide information around grade and reconciliation. We just need some more time as we ramp this up.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay. As a follow-up, as the interest in the drilling around Leeville, and are there other opportunities within Nevada, because you do have a big line position there and we’ve spoken before about projects that higher gold prices might become attractive.
Richard O'Brien: Yes. We are very excited by the growth prospects in Nevada. And I think after a number of years of making sure that we can get the operations right there, the team is really focused on growth. And Guy may want to add a few things to that.
Guy Lansdown: In a number of products – John, good morning to you. A number of projects that we have out there in addition to Leeville, obviously we’re excited about what we’re finding there. Gold quarry is another one of the big ones. In addition to that, we have up to 25 projects through various stages of the pipeline throughout the state.
Richard O'Brien: And on a return basis, obviously these are the highest returning projects that we have really because we use a lot of the existing infrastructure, although if things continue as well, Leeville and Turf is we are seeing, we will be adding infrastructure to access that production.
Guy Lansdown: And the challenge for us will be permitting, getting our permits in place, which we have a team actively working on to support the development of these projects.
John Bridges – JPMorgan: Okay. Guys, good luck.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain. Your line is open.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank Securities: Yes. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. This is the second quarter in a row where you’ve topped sort of dollar per share earnings and you continue to maintain your dividend policy at $0.10, in line with what you’ve done historically for the past few years when you had a much lower EPS. So my question is, where is management’s thinking in terms of when would it make sense if to raise a dividend in the future, what would you favor, higher cash dividend or share buybacks? And then in terms of your growth, obviously there are some M&A opportunities happening overseas. Just wanted to get your view as to if you believe your best internal – your best growth option to your internal as you’ve highlighted in Nevada and possibly in Africa medium-term.
Richard O'Brien: Okay. So a couple of questions there. First, on the dividend, as you know, the market for gold stocks doesn’t necessarily pay an increasing value related to increasing our cash dividend. I would say though if we do anything, it’s more likely that we would probably have a cash dividend increase rather than a share buyback, because we also believe although I can’t say that financially this makes a lot of sense that it’s not clear to us the per share metrics, really drive a lot of valuation again in the market. We believe it should. And over time, as it does, I think you will see us be more responsive to increases in dividends and perhaps share buyback if we can continue to generate significant cash flow, as we are over the past three quarters really. So our balance sheet looks in good shape to develop these projects. We are finding some interesting opportunities internally. That’s where we’d rather invest our cash versus at the external projects or an increase in the dividend, we’d rather go for growth and drive our return on assets up by having appropriate investments. And I would say that relative to external investments, we would prefer internal investments every time. That doesn’t mean that we won’t look externally, but we will look at that in terms of the trade-off between paying a premium to acquire something, issuing additional shares, because we do think that dilution matters and making sure that we properly evaluate opportunities. If we do see something in the market, for the upside that they made bring in addition to current assets. So I think a wide ranging view here in terms of our openness to look at things. But as we continue to look – I’d say, we continue to believe that exploration, the project development, and M&A are the way we are going to continue to build the company and will flex back and forth.
Jorge Beristain – Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Haughton, and your line is open.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Yes. Good morning and thank you for the rundown. I’ve got a couple of questions with regards to Batu Hijau. Firstly, the proceeds from the sales, are they recorded in your cash flow for the quarter?
Russell Ball: Yes. In the financing section, David, I can step you through it. You will see a line in there, Proceeds from non-controlling, it’s about 220 million. And then the shade at Sumitomo is entitled to the NTP partnership of approximately $100 million is included in the line Dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders. So what you will see in the financing activities section is a mix of about $129 million that accrued to Newmont shareholders.
Richard O'Brien: To be clear though, Russ, they are not in our operating cash flows. They are in the financing cash flows.
Russell Ball: (inaudible) that’s correct.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Thank you, Russell. I was looking for that $129 million. The second question, still on Batu Hijau, I noticed that you are in the bottom of the pit and it is seasonal whether you are down in the bottom or not. And you had expressed that the higher tonnage in grade was as a result of that. What kind of profile could we expect for the balance of the year?
Brian Hill: David, it’s Brian. We are not quite in the bottom of the pit yet. We are still mining in the upper benches in Phase 5, but we are getting better grades and better mill throughput. We are just coming into the dry season now. So we are in the process of dewatering the bottom of the pit in Phase 5. So our expectations are that we will be down in the bottom of Phase 5 later in Q2 and Q3 until the rains come again either late Q3 or early Q4. So we should see higher production coming out of Batu over the second and third quarter, as we get into that sort of sweet spot, which is the central core at the bottom of Phase 5.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: And then just following on from that, I presume as the conditions (inaudible) slightly lower production in the fourth quarter and then you start in 2011 moving into the stripping phase.
Brian Hill: That’s correct. Slightly lower in Q4 and then 2011, as Russ mentioned, concentrated stripping in Phase 6 with lower production next year.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. I have another question, different topic. Outlooking at Hope Bay, I heard you mention that you are expecting to spend $180 million to $200 million on Doris. Is it correct for this year?
Guy Lansdown: This is Guy. That is correct. Last time we mentioned we were counting on spending of the order of $140 million this year. We’ve increased that spending to between $180 million and $200 million. We are advancing activities that we had planned for 2011 into 2010. And the bulk of it is shipping supplies and equipment up. We believe underway at the moment was an (inaudible), as I mentioned earlier. And what we’d do is just start the decline later in the year, which is going to take up a fair amount of that cost. In addition to that, we’ve got drilling activities and we’ve advanced a number of infrastructure construction activities like roads, camps, and the fuel pumps. So we are pretty excited about the program we’ve got underway this year.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Right. And what we see at kind of place of expenditure in 2011 as well?
Guy Lansdown: We’d certainly hope so. A lot would depend on what we find when we get into the decline, and we start exploring underground, but our hope is that we’ve continue at a pretty aggressive pace if all the signs are positive.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And do you have a sense for what the total project CapEx might be?
Guy Lansdown: Not at this stage, David. We are in real early stages again depending on what we find as we get into the decline. And as we go through the study first, we’d develop a range but it’s a little too early to give any idea of what the total CapEx might be.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: So then the development potential of Madrid and Boston would be pushed sometime out into the future and you’re focusing on Doris at the moment?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that’s correct, David. We’re focusing on Doris right now, but obviously Boston and Madrid, we’d like to follow up pretty shortly after Doris. Again, positive result spending.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Now, with this decline, clearly it’s still exploratory at this stage, but I presume it would be built to a development style if things turned out the way you hope it would be.
Guy Lansdown: Yes, Doris is – the Doris project is one that we’ve actually got a permit for at present. So we would concentrate our efforts over there. It’s – it would be pretty small scale. Again, if positive results – if we return positive results in our decline, we’re focusing on understanding what the grade and continuity would be, what the mining course would be, taking into account your technical and geological conditions. And obviously that will give us a bit of feel for what the district might look like.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: Right. On a different continent now, I heard that the Super Pit earthquake had disrupted some production. Is that going to have any impact on the second quarter output?
Russell Ball: No, it actually didn’t disrupt any production that we had at KCGM, David. So it’s not going to have an impact on us.
David Haughton – BMO Capital Markets: All right. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next caller is from – Barry Cooper, your line is open, sir.
Barry Cooper – CIBC World Markets: Yes. Good day, everyone. Just wondering if you could clarify some of these numbers that you have at Leeville and Turf looks obviously quite interesting. But can you tell me what is the cut-off that you are using for your mining at Leeville just so we can put it into context of what kind of prices above and below the threshold there?
Guy Lansdown: Barry, I’m sorry. I don’t have the current cut-offs off the top of my head. This is Guy. I can certainly give it for you. And we do have Investor Day coming up May 27th. We would love to go through these projects in more detail with you. So (inaudible) off the top of my head.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, Barry, I can follow up after the call.
Barry Cooper – CIBC World Markets: Okay. Then the second question, your – I'm assuming you are having some pretty good success with high pressure grinding mills and whatnot. Is there any other application that you can see using those for, because obviously there are others out there in the world that are using these more and more now? Indeed I have to assume that you have a bulk load of low-grade sulphide mineralization that’s too low for your – too low grade for your mill, but might be something that could be (inaudible) as we went through our pressure grinding rolls and whatnot because that is certainly being contemplated now. Have your impact started doing any of that work or thought process?
Richard O'Brien: Barry, we were pretty excited about the way the prices are performing at Boddington. And we certainly look at these where applicable for some of our earlier stage projects. Obviously you need high – very hard material that tend to be much better performance with hard material. Certainly, as we go through projects where that could be applied, we take that into consideration.
Brian Hill: Barry, one place we might look at them is in application at Batu. And if we look further out at some of the other opportunities like in long [ph] that we have in Indonesia, I mean, they performed exceptionally well for our sect at Boddington. We just couldn’t have asked for better performance out of them so far in this first phase of ramp-up.
Barry Cooper – CIBC World Markets: What about things like in and around Phoenix? I realize it’s a different piece and whatnot, but I think a better thing is current and typically very hard mineralization there as well. And I know you maybe don’t want upset the apple cart because that one had trouble starting up and you’ve mastered those now. But is there anything there that could be utilized or held for in Nevada?
Richard O'Brien: I think there is certainly some potential applications that we will continue to look at. I think it’s wonderful to have this operating experience coming out of Boddington, and we’ll certainly going to take that and leverage is going forward. As you know, they present a form of crushing, which just brings a significantly lower power cost to actually crush raw.
Barry Cooper – CIBC World Markets: Right. OK, thank you very much.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Barry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Chidley, and your line is open.
Patrick Chidley – Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Hi, guys. Just couple of quick questions. Just firstly on the philosophy with regards to growth, you’ve got one of these great projects that you are bringing forward slowly over the next few years. But what are you thinking about the balance of geography that you would be comfortable with in terms of balancing different countries and the country risks. Is there any sort of firm views on percentage-wise you have in developed markets and non-developed markets?
Randy Engel: Hey, Patrick, it’s Randy. We actually, I think, feel very comfortable with the mix we’ve got right now. We actually have a presence across the globe. We’ve got a good set of four quarter regions. We are comfortable in each of those regions. We are actually comfortable looking to expand in each one of them. So you see us looking to expand in South America, we’ve got expansion in North America, we’ve got the same in Africa, and you’ll see us doing the same in APEC. That was certainly our first choices to expand around those existing regions. But we do have appetite to go beyond that as well.
Richard O'Brien: I think – Patrick, just – sorry, it’s Richard. Maintaining a good level of production, whether that’s 50% or 40%, but something like that to AAA over time is currently where our portfolio sits. And to the extent that we continue to look to add to that, I would hope that we’d be able to either develop or acquire assets that continue to have AAA ratings so that we can actually balance the overall portfolio over time. With proviso that who knows what AAA is going to be as we move into time here.
Patrick Chidley – Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Right, right, right. But basically you want to keep that mix that you’ve already got as a sort of a cornerstone of the portfolio mix?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, we’ve got – averaged about half of our operating margin coming out of Asia-Pacific and North America with that focused out of Australia and Nevada. I think that’s a mix to the extent that we can keep roughly half of that in that kind of profile. That’s preferred.
Patrick Chidley – Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Great. Thanks. And just quick one on exploration, Boddington, you mentioned anything on what’s been going on at Boddington? I think last quarter you did refer to some positive results. And I just wanted to see where you are on that.
Guy Lansdown: Patrick, this is Guy. The positive results were on the northern extent of the purchase that we had seen relatively higher grade material. We continue drilling in the area looking for similar opportunities. Obviously there are a little further out in the mine plan, but as we are doing at gold quarry, and Leeville we turn out to understand the fuller extent of these opportunities so that we can optimize them down the road. And that’s what we plan to do going forward with Boddington.
Patrick Chidley – Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Okay. So it’s just an ongoing process really?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that’s right, Patrick.
Patrick Chidley – Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our next question comes from Stephen Walker. And sir, your line is open.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much, operator. Two questions, but first with respect to the government of Ghana had made some comments here recently about revisiting existing tax and royalty structures for the mining operations in Ghana. First of all, how would this – can you give us an update on where that stands and potential impact for a household. And secondly, most of that, with respect to receiving the mining lease for Hakeem, what if anything, has been decided in the way of taxes for that project?
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Stephen, for that question. So I’ll try to answer both at the same time. We have an investment agreement that was entered into – before we began the development of the households and because we knew that Akyem might at some point be developed. Actually, Akyem is covered by the same investment agreement. So we are actually protected, if you will, against upward changes and taxes, changes in the tax structure, and upward changes in the royalty. All that said, we do have a new government that came into place at the end of the year. And they have indicated a desire to review our investment agreement. And what we’ve told them is that – we have a contract, but of course we will sit down and talk with them. So what I would tell you is that while we won’t be impacted directly by some of the changes that continue to be talked about in the government and the impact on other mining companies. I would tell you that while we are protected, we do want to be a good citizen in Ghana. So we will probably make some changes over time. I don’t know what those look like. And I would tell you that because we have an agreement, it probably won’t look like everybody else’s. But we will try to make sure that while we assure shareholders’ return that if we continue to be an environment of higher gold prices we do reflect some additional return back to Ghana. But this is all under development and we will just see how it goes as we move forward over the next couple of months. And I would say that probably going to be that kind of timeframe before we really know what the total impact is going to be and we will keep you apprised.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you, Richard. Second question has to do with costs outlook on a quarterly basis. You’ve seen a sharp price from the fourth quarter cost of about $413 million on a co-product basis to $480 per ounce. The $480 is at the upper end of your guidance, which suggests that going forward there is potential for decline now. I don’t know if you can give us any detail on how you think the quarters will look, or is it safe to assume that there will be a much more positive contribution for Batu in the second and third quarter. And then an ongoing positive contribution from Boddington just with respect to quarterly modeling. Can you give us a little more guidance on that for 2010?
Russell Ball: Yes, Steve, it’s Russ. You essentially spot on us, as Brian mentioned earlier, and historically what we’ve seen is a strong Q2 and Q3 in the dry season in Indonesia. And as we mentioned earlier, we will be in the bottom of Phase 5, and that’s with the high grade copper and gold, more particularly six. We’ll have a nice second and third quarter there. And then with the ongoing ramp-up and you saw on slide 14, I think it was the ramp-up cliff as that continues to progress to full production. We’ll see cause decrease in Australia and production increase. So you should model that in. And again, we have changed our assumption on gold price in Apex. And that’s added about $15 to $20 an ounce. And we’ve absorbed that into the cost guidance. So yes, it has moved towards the upper end. But we still feel very comfortable that we can deliver based on the results of the first quarter at least.
Stephen Walker – RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much, Russell. Thank you
Russell Ball: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. O'Brien for any closing comments.
Richard O'Brien: Okay. Thank you, operator. And thank you, everybody, for attending our call today. And we look forward, as we said, to seeing many of you either in person or over webcast on May 27th. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-25 10:00:00) =====
Executives: John Seaberg -- VP, IR Richard O'Brien -- President and CEO Brian Hill -- EVP, Operations Russell Ball -- EVP and CFO Guy Lansdown -- EVP, Discovery and Development Randy Engel -- EVP, Strategic Development
Analysts: John Bridges -- JPMorgan David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet Lane Adler [ph] Brian MacArthur -- UBS Securities
Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
John Seaberg: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on our Q4 and year-end 2009 earnings call. Joining me today are the members of our executive leadership team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, as usual, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John. I would like to start today's call by revisiting Newmont’s strategic priorities outlined on slide 3, for those of you with access to our simulcast presentation. In 2009, we continued to execute well in our operations and drive significant improvement in our financial performance. As we look forward, we believe that successfully executing on the key benchmarks that we set out for the company at the beginning of each year will lead to increased value for our shareholders. Less execution risk should imply a higher value for our portfolio of operations and projects. We continue to work tirelessly to achieve our strategic priorities every year, and we are pleased that 2009 to a significant degree solidified our foundation of doing what we say we will do. Our continuous focus on disciplined planning in operational and business excellence enabled us again to deliver on our annual operational guidance for 2009, just as they did in 2008. The operating results, along with the robust gold price environment led to record financial performance, including the generation of almost $3 billion in operating cash flow, which Russell will speak to later. Now that we have reached the construction completion and commercial production milestones at our Boddington project in Australia, we are focusing our efforts on advancing our next generation of projects, 30 million to 40 million targeted ounces of development opportunities, of which approximately 20 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves at this year end, with the remainder being at earlier stages of definition. Guy will review a number of these opportunities a little later in the presentation. Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, combined with expected future cash flow should provide the funding we need to develop these world-class mining projects. And finally, we consistently aim to improve our safety record and commitment to environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. That said, 2009 was a somber year for Newmont, as we mourn the loss of four co-workers who died as a result of fail accidents in our operations. Because of our relentless commitment to creating the safest possible work environment, we recognize that fatalities are simply unacceptable. We continue to believe that we must get to a zero injury, not just zero-fatality workplace. Safe production is the bottom line here at Newmont. 2009 did offer some high points in our environmental, social and community relations efforts. We completed and published the findings from our unprecedented Community Relations Review, and brought together a global workshop held in Washington DC late in the year for many of the participants to hear feedback from the communities who had a chance to review the CRR. However, our work doesn't stop with just a review. We are in the process of developing standards and pushing them throughout our organization to build better relationships and more sustainable relationships with our host communities. We are also pleased to be recognized as an industry leader in sustainability for the third consecutive year, by our selection to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We also recognize the challenges facing the world related to climate change. As such, we continue to look for ways to make our operations more energy-efficient and take an industry leading role on this critical issue. Turning to 2009 performance highlights on slide four, we had an excellent year, setting records for revenue, adjusted net income, and operating cash flow. In 2009, Newmont generated $7.7 billion in revenue, a 26% increase over 2008. We also generated record operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, a 109% increase over 2008. And our adjusted net income increased to $1.4 billion, or $2.79 per share, as 60% improvement on the year. Our equity gold sales reached 5.3 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $417 per ounce, both within our guidance announced at the beginning of 2009. While realized gold prices grew 12%, our margin on gold increased 28%, demonstrating our ability to deliver strong financial leverage to the gold price. We also sold 226 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of $0.64 per pound. In addition to record financial results, our combination of excellent 2009 exploration results and the acquisition of Anglo’s one-third interest in Boddington, resulted in equity gold reserves of 92 million ounces, an 8% increase over 2008. This marks the highest level for our equity gold reserves since 2006, and equity copper results of 9.1 billion pounds, a 17% increase over last year. We are excited about these results, as this forms the foundation for future growth to our existing operations and our strong pipeline of products. 2009 marks a significant milestone in Newmont’s transformation and positions us to further emerge as a leader in the mining industry. Turning to slide five and focusing on our fourth quarter results in particular, our operations generated consolidated revenue of $2.5 billion, a 90% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. Net operating cash flow was approximately $1 billion, a 323% increase over 2008. Our net adjusted income rose 379% to $561 million, or $1.14 per share, an improvement of 338% over last year. Equity gold sales for the quarter were 1.5 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $413 per ounce. This quarter's costs applicable to sales were 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008, thanks to a continuous focus on cost control and higher production. These operating results, paired with a 38% realized gold price increase, led to a 94% increase in our gold operating margin. Copper, as in the third quarter, also contributed significantly to our success. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold 72 million equity pounds of copper at $3.24 per pound with costs applicable to sales of $0.64 per pound. I want to acknowledge the dedication and commitment of our employees worldwide. We had a superb 2009. Our total equity gold sales for the year, focusing on slide six, were 5.3 million ounces, falling in the center of the range for our original outlook. Our full-year costs applicable to sales of $417 per ounce also comes in the lower half of the original outlook range of $400 to $440. Due to the delayed completion of Boddington, our consolidated capital expenditures were $1.8 billion, above our original outlook range, and above our third-quarter outlook update of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. As we mentioned, the delayed start up of Boddington pushed this number higher for the year, as we continued to capitalize pre-commercial production and interest costs, until we achieved commercial production in mid-November. I will now ask Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations, to take us through our operating details on a regional level.
Brian Hill: Thank you, Richard. Slide seven illustrates our regional performance as compared to our outlook for 2009. We are proud that across our entire portfolio, our focus on operational education produced equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales results in line with our original expectations, which speaks to the hard work, alignment, and dedication of our employees in each one of our regions. In Nevada, we sold more than 2 million ounces of gold, just slightly ahead of our outlook, due to higher underground tons mined at Leeville and Deep Post, and higher leach recovery at Carlin North and Twin Creeks. Costs applicable to sales in Nevada were $521 an ounce, lower than our expectations due to higher production, fewer tons mined, partially offset by higher royalties, higher net proceeds taxes, and higher underground mining costs. At our operations in Australia and New Zealand, we sold 1.3 million equity ounces of gold, below our original guidance of 1.5 million to 1.6 million ounces, due to the delayed start up at Boddington. Gold sales at Jundee again came in higher than expected, as we continue to have higher ore grade at this operation, which was offset by lower-than-anticipated sales at Tanami, due to lower ore grade and at Waihi, as a result of an electrical fire in the mill earlier in the year. Costs applicable to sales of $508 per ounce were above our original expectations, but were in line with our third quarter updated outlook. At Yanacocha in Peru, equity gold sales reached 1.1 million ounces, beating our outlook due to higher mill throughput, ore grade, and recovery. Costs applicable to sales were $311 per ounce, just outside the top end of our original expectation of $290 to $310 per ounce, as higher gold prices resulted in higher royalty and workers’ participation costs, partially offset by higher mill production, and by product credits. Our Ahafo operation in Ghana sold 546,000 equity ounces of gold, well above our expectations, due to higher ore grade and throughput, and a drawdown of finished goods inventory. Ahafo’s costs applicable to sales were $445 per ounce, better than expected due to lower mining costs as a result of lower than expected waste material mined and lower power costs. And finally, equity gold sales at Batu Hijau in Indonesia were 239,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $214 per ounce, which was lower than expected, due to lower diesel and mining costs, and higher co-product allocation of costs to copper. Across the portfolio, we are very pleased with our operational performance, and continue to look for innovative ways to improve upon these results. Now, I will turn it over to Russell Ball, our CFO, to highlight some of the more interesting financial results for the year.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Brian. On slide eight, you will see our gold operating margin for 2009 grew 28% on an average realized gold price increase of 12%, demonstrating our ability to deliver gold price leverage to the bottom line. In 2009, gold operating margin of 57% is an all-time high, and this does not take into account any benefits from our copper sales, which as Richard mentioned previously, grew significantly in 2009 and we look forward to an even stronger 2010. As you can see from this chart, historically, our margins were in the 45% to 50% range, not too dissimilar from the rest of the industry. Now, with the continuing focus on cost control, and full of exposure to rising gold, copper, and silver prices, we are seeing substantial earnings in operating cash flow growth. For the 2005 to 2009 timeframe, gold margins increased by 175% on an average realized gold price increase of 122%. On slide nine, you can see our operating cash flows in absolute dollar terms. 2009 was a record year, as we generated almost $3 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 109% from 2008. Looking at the chart on the right side of this slide, you can see that we have an extremely strong balance sheet with over $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have approximately $1.6 billion available under our revolving credit facility, plus approximately $1 billion in marketable securities. The $6 billion of available liquidity positions us well for funding internal growth to the development of our project pipeline, and potentially through acquisitions. Now, I will turn it over to Guy Lansdown, our EVP for Discovery and Development, to talk about our 2009 exploration results, proven and probable reserves, and advanced products.
Guy Lansdown: Thank you, Russell. Looking at slide 10, as we mentioned earlier, our proven and probable gold reserves grew 8% in 2009 to approximately 92 million equity ounces, the highest result there was since 2006. At the same time, our copper reserves grew 17% to 9.1 billion equity pounds, our highest level on record. Our exploration programs alone replaced over 90% of our gold production depletion. Gold addition came from all regions, with notable new ounces at the Gold Quarry pitch in Nevada, Boddington in Australia, underground operations across Australia and New Zealand, and at Ahafo in Ghana. In addition to our 2009 equity copper reserves being the highest on record for Newmont, our equity copper NRM is at the highest level since 2003, largely due to the Boddington acquisition completed in January of 2009, and a greater economic interest in Batu Hijau in Indonesia. These increases, combined with our general exploration opportunities, will support future sustainability and growth in each of our operating regions. We have focused our exploration efforts across the full breadth of the (inaudible). We will continue to strengthen our reserve base, as we have budgeted $190 million to $220 million for exploration in 2010, a 10% increase from last year, 75% of which has been budgeted for new mine opportunities. Turning to slide 11, we are excited about these two major projects in our African region, the Akyem project, which is up for a final development position and full funding approval in the third quarter of this year and as a beta expansion opportunity near our existing Ahafo operation. With respect to Akyem, as mentioned earlier this year, we recently received the mining lease from the Ghanaian government, and have commenced the necessary crop compensation and relocation work. We are committed to implementing industry-leading environmental and socially responsible practices, as we bring this project into production in late 2013 to 2014. We are extremely excited about this project, as we have come up with some innovative ways to reduce the project's capital costs and increase the return on capital. Current initial capital estimates are between $700 million and $1 billion, to produce between 480,000 and 550,000 ounces of gold per year, at average costs applicable to sales of between $350 and $450 per ounce. We are aggressively moving this project forward, and plan to spend approximately $100 million this year, 2010, on basic and detailed project engineering, land access, and building out on this team. As mentioned, we will be looking at making a go-forward decision in the third quarter of this year. Looking at the Subika expansion project, we have identified a target of approximately 7 million to 9 million equity ounces of gold, of which approximately 3 million ounces are in proven and probable reserves, and the remainder is at earlier stages of definition, including underground operations. We began construction of an exploration beacon in February of this year, and are conducting simultaneous exploration drilling from both the surface and underground to further delineate this deposit. The Subika project will be our first underground operation in Ghana, and demonstrates the potential in and around our existing Ahafo operation. Slide 12 highlights two other major projects, Conga in Peru, and Hope Bay in Canada. At Conga in 2010, we are advancing the permitting process in basic and detailed engineering, with a gate for full funding decision targeted for the end of the fourth quarter, depending on permitting. Conga is a large copper gold field, with consolidated reserves of approximately 12 million ounces of gold and over 3 billion pounds of copper. First production is currently anticipated for late 2014 to 2015, with average annual production of 650,000 to 750,000 ounces of gold, and 160 million to 210 million pounds of copper at competitive operating costs. The current initial capital estimate stands at between $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion, on 100% basis. Buenaventura is our partner on this project, and as with Yanacocha, Newmont earns 51.35%. We are very excited about this project. First, because it has an expected mine life in excess of 20 years, and because there is tremendous exploration potential in the district. We are also excited about our vision for the advancement of our Hope Bay project in Canada. Positive 2009 drilling and regional exploration results, combined with a favorable review from our Jundee operations team in Australia, have reinforced our positive view of gold resource potential across the 80 kilometer Greenstone belt. We are advancing development with an underground focus, to be initiated with a decline at the Doris north deposit. Although still in the early stages, we are energized about this opportunity and we now have an experienced team and key contractors in place. With near-term development plans and district exploration for years to come, Hope Bay is a significant asset within our portfolio. We have $140 million to $170 million budgeted for 2010, primarily for exploration infrastructure and to advance the decline. We look forward to updating you on Hope Bay’s progress throughout the year. Now, I will turn it over to Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Looking at our 2010 outlook on slide 13, equity gold production is expected to be between 5.3 million and 5.5 million equity ounces, driven by higher production from the Asia-Pacific region, as a result of the ramp-up of Boddington to full production, partially offset by lower production from Nevada in North America, and at Yanacocha in South America, as a result of increased stripping and lower ore grades. Total costs applicable to sales are expected to be between $450 and $480 per ounce, including the impacts of accounting for Boddington on a co-product basis. Total costs applicable to sales would be expected to be between $440 and $470 per ounce, including the impacts of accounting for Boddington on a by-product basis. Costs applicable to sales are up in 2010 from 2009 as a result of lower production at Yanacocha, and low production at Nevada. By the way, Boddington, on a standalone basis, would be about $295 to $315, announced on a by-product basis; and about $375 to $395, announced on a co-product basis. Our copper production in 2010 is expected to be 350 million to 380 million pounds, at costs applicable to sales of $0.85 to $0.95 per pound, driven by higher production at Batu Hijau, and the ramp-up of slightly higher cost production at Boddington. We also expect to spend on a consolidated basis $1.4 million to $1.6 million in capital expenditures in 2010. This figure includes the capital related to aggressively advancing the development of our projects, which Guy spoke to earlier, and there is a chart in our earnings release, which goes into detail on the spending on those projects. Moving to slide 14, at the time of our third-quarter earnings call, we announced that we believed our 2010 production would be up 5% to 10% from 2009 levels. Our outlook, as presented today, is at the bottom of that previous guidance, and I wanted to describe the major factors affecting this shift to the lower end of that range. As mentioned earlier, the biggest incremental contributor to our production profile in 2010 is Boddington, which we anticipate will produce 800,000 to 875,000 equity gold ounces in 2010. And that is slightly below our targeted 1 million ounce run rate, as we continue to ramp up to full production throughout 2010. As you know, our Yanacocha operation continues to mature, since commercial operation began there in 1993, and we expect its production in 2010 to decline to between 750,000 and 810,000 equity gold ounces. Incrementally, this represents a decline of approximately 300,000 ounces from 2009. The primary reasons for the decline in production is lower leach placement, and lower mill ore grade. Looking forward, we expect South America’s production to remain near 2010 levels. Turning to Nevada, our production outlook for 2010 is 1.6 million to 1.7 million equity gold ounces, approximately 17% lower than our 2009 production, due to lower production from the Carlin operations and the closure of Deep Post, partially offset by increased production at Leeville. The lower production at Carlin is due to a geotechnical event we experienced in late December at Gold Quarry, limiting access to ore that was originally scheduled to be mined in 2010 and 2011. Following the series of geotechnical mine planning and ore blending analysis conducted in January and February this year, up to approximately 150,000 equity ounces of gold production are expected to be deferred from Gold Quarry in 2010, with potential additional ounces deferred in 2011. We continue to study opportunities to safely accelerate the production of the ounces currently scheduled to be produced in 2012 and 2013. Of course, this event will not likely affect our life of mine plants for Gold Quarry, but it does defer the production of those ounces to 2012, 2013 timeframe. In total, we are expecting 2010 equity gold production to be between 5.3 million and 5.5 million ounces, which represents production growth potential of up to 5%. Turning to copper, we expect to produce between 350 million and 380 million equity pounds of copper in 2010. That is up approximately 60% from 2009 levels. This is driven by the ramp-up of Boddington, as well as an assumed economic interest of 52.44% in Batu Hijau. Looking at slide 15, our 2010 costs applicable to sales outlook compared to the 2009 actual figure, is that higher costs are primarily driven by lower production at Yanacocha and Nevada, as well as the change in accounting for Boddington from a by-product credit basis to co-product accounting. Boddington's low-cost production will benefit our 2010 costs applicable to sales as well, bringing the total costs applicable to sales for the year to between $450 to $480 per ounce as I mentioned earlier. Our costs applicable to sales for copper will be slightly higher in 2010 compared to 2009, as a result of more costs being allocated to copper at Batu Hijau, as well as co-product accounting treatment at Boddington. As previously mentioned, our consolidated capital expenditure outlook for 2010 is $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, with approximately 30% invested in each of the North America and Asia-Pacific regions, and the remaining 40% at other locations. Approximately 60% of the 2010 capital budget is allocated to sustaining investments, with the remaining 40% allocated to project development, including the development of Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru, and Hope Bay in Canada. We will continue to provide additional information about our projects throughout the year. In closing, our achievements in 2009 provide Newmont a strong and enduring foundation for strong operating results and project development capacity for decades to come. We have demonstrated that we have the ability to consistently deliver on our plans and do what we say we are going to do. We have also demonstrated our ability to deliver significant margin growth, and leverage to an increasing gold price. Our existing production base and focus on responsibly containing our costs have given us strong operating cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet to fund the development of our next generation of major gold and copper projects. As we embark on our next major mine development campaign, Newmont is well-positioned to take advantage of ongoing strength in metal prices. We are inspired by Newmont's ongoing transformation, as the changes we have implemented begin to yield noteworthy results for our shareholders and stakeholders. And we are not done yet. As I stated at the beginning of this presentation, we are all committed to doing what it takes to make Newmont the most valued and respected mining company through industry-leading performance. Lastly, I again want to express my gratitude to our employees for delivering a record year, and for the foundation they are creating to ensure the future success of our company. And with that, I would like to thank all of you for listening and open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) John Bridges, your line is open.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Thank you. And good morning, Richard.
Richard O'Brien: Hey, John.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Hi. Just wondered if I could get a better sense of the status of the go ahead on these projects? You are talking about CapEx as if you are going ahead with these things, but you are going to put them to the Board during the year, I would guess. Is some of the spending provisional on the Board go-ahead?
Richard O'Brien: No, John. Really, where we are is we have authorization to move forward on these projects, but in our disciplined stage gate approach, we are really trying to signal to you that in the case of Conga, we don't have a permit yet and in the case of the development at Akyem, we are still moving forward with land access to make sure we finalize that as well as completing the final feasibility for the project. So, that is the status, we are moving forward on both of these. We are careful though to make sure that we have milestones, so that we can keep these projects on track and keep them in front of the Board as well as our shareholders.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Okay, that is helpful. And then, as a follow-up, Hope Bay is probably a little bit more difficult for us to understand than the two big projects. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more of a sense as to what you hope to develop there?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, let me turn it over to Guy and he can give you a current update on what we are doing at Hope Bay.
Guy Lansdown: Good morning, John.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Good morning.
Guy Lansdown: John, what we have is a revitalized team at Hope Bay, and we have just built up a team of folks who are very experienced in the Arctic, and we have drawn on the resources in Jundee, where we have a geological formation which is similar to Hope Bay, which has given us confirmation and the ability to start notching out a more detailed development plan for the project. What we plan on doing is pulling on from the positive exploration results that we have had is to start driving a decline. We would like to understand the resource better, understand what the extraction processes are, set up the infrastructure to continue exploring and developing, and from that point on with positive results, our plan is to go in with a phased approach with regard to putting in our processing facilities, perhaps a smaller plant down the road, but our first step is to get in with the decline this year and set up infrastructure. So, we are very excited about the project and the -- both the exploration results that we have got, not only from the drill but also from our regional (inaudible) study.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I would just add to that, John, that I think we have an exceptional opportunity at Hope Bay, and it is an opportunity with some risk, and that risk we can only really refine our understanding of that by driving a decline and moving forward. But remember, we have a large district here, which we own 100% of the rights to. We are beginning to understand that district more and more and I think Guy and Cindy Williams and the team have put together a really good plan for us to step out and I hope that when we meet with analysts in May of this year, we will have a better opportunity to talk with you in detail, is that right, is it in May, when are we meeting in Boston? May. Yes, we are going to have a May Analyst Day, and maybe reread you some further disclosure on what is going on at Hope Bay, but I would say, as Guy said, I think we are re-energized about the opportunities there.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Those are game plans to get your hands around the one project and then you can go look at the other targets.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I think the idea is to get in and the only way we are really going to refine this is to get underground and start to follow these narrow high-grade veins and I think that is why we are really leaning more and more on our global knowledge, particularly out of the people at Jundee, who as you know, over the last couple of years you have heard Russell refer to Jundee as the little engine that could, it just keeps going and we are hoping that those people will help us here as well.
John Bridges -- JPMorgan: Okay, excellent. Well done, guys. Thank you.
Operator: David Haughton, your line is open.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Good morning and thank you. Just following on from that Hope Bay discussion, I noticed in the slides that the capital expenditure was $140 million to $170 million and yet in the document that we are looking at, it was about half that level. Just wondering what that difference might be and whether it is attributable to exploration versus CapEx?
Richard O'Brien: That is it exactly. Actually, in total, we are looking at probably $200 million or so in both infrastructure, which will relate to pre-ordering equipment and driving the decline to actually begin this effort as well as continued exploration and development expenses related to that.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: And I am presuming with the decline that that is on the Doris ore body?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that is correct, David. That is our intention as we start the decline in the Doris north area, where we have got a better understanding of the resource and as Richard said, of the total $140 million to $170 million, about half of that is for capital for infrastructure on the decline. The remainder is for study work and exploration.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Just switching now to Gold Quarry, I had noted the geotechnical issue you confronted there. I am just wondering whether the deferred production impacts the strength of Nevada royalty, or whether it is outside of that footprint.
Brian Hill: David, this is Brian, good morning. At this point in time, we expect that there will be some impact on the royalty. We haven't got a final number in terms of quantifying what that might be and when we do, we will be moving forward and talking with our royalty holders about what that impact might be.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Thanks, Brian. And finally, on Batu Hijau, just a little bit confused about your expression of ownership at 52.44%, because after sell-down, it ought to have gone to something in the order of 31.5%. I wonder if you could talk me through that logic.
Russell Ball: David, hi, it is Russ Ball. What we have in Indonesia is a 35.44% equity interest as of the end of 2009 and we have a 17% economic interest in our Indonesian partner, who we loaned a significant amount to address some of his issues. So what we have is a 35% economic equity interest, plus 17% based on economics which will accrue to us. The loan is entirely -- the only recourse we have is to future production and so that is the way we have accounted it. This is similar to the accounting, David, you remember from 2000 to roughly 2007, when we had a similar loan facility outstanding with our partner.
Richard O'Brien: David, it doesn't show up this way, but I think if you view it as a carried interest as Russ said we had earlier, it is almost identical; the accounting is somewhat different, but the economic results are very near to that, picking up that additional 17%.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Now I presume that through time, that 17% would work its way down to zero, as the full gone revenue would make up that difference at the line.
Russell Ball: Yes, David, we will stay at 17% until the loan in, including a 14% interest and accrued interest on that loan is fully repaid.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Do you have an expectation when that might be, Russ?
Russell Ball: At these metal prices, sometimes in the next couple of years.
David Haughton -- BMO Capital Markets: Okay. All right, thank you very much. That concludes my questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Barry Cooper, your line is open.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: Yes, just wondering if you could flesh out a little bit more. You indicated that Boddington didn't live up to your expectations, just how is it going and are your expectations, were they modified at all for 2010.
Richard O'Brien: When we say it didn't live up to our expectations, I think it is solely the fact that we had about a four-month delay in terms of getting the project to construction completion. I would say we did better-than-expected in terms of ramping up to commercial production, really getting the project from construction completion very rapidly into mid-November, surpassing that 65% plus sort of level of operating. I will tell you, over the last couple of months, from a mill operation standpoint, things are going very well. We have run the mill at or near capacity on several days, and I think the team is really executing very well. So in that respect, it is actually going probably beyond our expectations. Back into the mine, I think we still have some work to do, you know, from the pit to the primary crusher, and I think we will continue to optimize this facility over the next couple of years to ensure that we have got the right balance between mine production, all the way through to refining both copper and gold, and I think, you know, overall, we feel good about where we are on Boddington, I think emphasizing that the purchase of the Anglo interest was very economic for us and I think owning 100% of that, with current operations, we feel very good about that and I think the potential on that district will I think lead us to beyond a 20-plus year mine life that we have. So at this point, I would say it goes very well for us, and we are going to be happy to have some of your guys down to take a look at it, because I think when you see the facility and how operations are going, you will this is a pretty amazing facility and we are actually doing a really great job there and compliments to the team around the world for really supporting ramping that operation up as quickly as we did.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: Right, Richard. Well, I know it did beat my expectations there a little bit, so congratulations to that. What is the grade reconciliation that you are seeing so far, are you seeing any surprises there and what should we ultimately look for in terms of the recovery?
Brian Hill: Barry, it is Brian Hill, I will answer that for you. It is still pretty early days, you know, with respect to grade reconciliation, but what we are seeing so far as we are down a little bit on the gold grade reconciliation, but we are up on the copper grade reconciliation. From a recovery perspective, we are actually performing a little bit better than the low 80s that we had on gold and copper recovery in the middle. The other nice pleasant surprise we are seeing is we are also seeing little higher concentrate grades than we had expected. So really, from a metallurgical performance perspective, we are seeing results that are a little bit better than expected.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: Right, okay. And maybe you could just remind me, because I know Doris had a resource before and you have obviously done enough lot of work. What is the resource that is attributable to Doris now?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, this is Guy. At the moment, we have got a resource of up to about 300,000 ounces on the Doris area specifically, and we continue to explore around it and below it. So we will determine more of it as we get exploration results throughout the year.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: And the grade of that would be, roughly?
Guy Lansdown: The grade for that is in the 20 gram to 25 gram per ton range.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: Right, okay. And then just one final question. Throughout the release, you talk about, and kudos to you for giving us some guidance out to 2011 and 2012. I just want to ask a question so that I understand it correctly. You used the term production should be near the 2010 levels, the word “near” is used quite frequently. Near to me would mean less than 5% change, is that what you would interpret the word near to be as well?
Richard O'Brien: Nice test, Barry. I think near for us means -- you know, given all the vagaries of mining, you know, we are going to be pretty close to where we are today in both in those areas where we use the word near.
Barry Cooper -- CIBC World Markets: Okay, good enough.
Richard O'Brien: Yes.
Operator: Patrick Chidley, your line is open.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Hello, I didn't hear that. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on a great quarter.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: I wanted to actually look at some of the new projects, but you have obviously spent a bit of time talking about it. In particular, Subika underground, I thought I saw a resource of 7 million to 9 million equity ounces. Has that changed last year and is it the reason you had tremendous exploration success there?
Guy Lansdown: Patrick, this is Guy. We have to give you the split of 3 million ounces in the pit in the form of a layback. There is about 4.5 million ounces in NRM, which is split between a pitch and an underground tunnel to work out the optimal set up for uptick versus underground. The remainder is pre-NRM material, but to answer your question, yes we have improved from those results of our drilling progress throughout 2009.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: And the total number of that for just this particular area of Ahafo.
Guy Lansdown: The (inaudible) and the surrounds.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: All right. And then, how deep underground does that take you in terms of what you are seeing there in the resource?
Guy Lansdown: Well, at the moment, we have drilled down to about 500 meters, but the intent of that decline is to get down deeper, not only to understand the resource and the extraction costs, but to set ourselves up to explore further and deeper.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: All right. And in terms of underground, how are you modeling your whole body in terms of sort of dimensions that you might expect sometimes, so the average grades.
Guy Lansdown: Well, that is the process we are going through right at the moment, because it is in stage II of the study, so we are trying to optimize the size of the pit versus what the underground is going to look like.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: So would you -- I mean basically, would you anticipate any underground operation as being quite a bulk mining to this situation as opposed to narrow vein sort of mining.
Guy Lansdown: Yes, that is the invested case, but we are looking at different options at the moment. Patrick, again, it is stage II in our capital effectiveness process, so pretty early on, so difficult to say exactly how we are going to extract the material.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: And then, at Akyem, I think it was just touched upon there earlier, but you mentioned the CapEx number of $700 million to $1 billion, and then separately, you mentioned that you are looking -- you should have found some improvements to the CapEx. Is that range including the improvements or is that the improvements may be pushing those numbers around.
Guy Lansdown: Well, that is our previous number, Patrick, while we go through the development of stage IV, we would anticipate in co-operating our reductions, if there are any, with talk to tighten up the range a bit. But we are not only looking at improving the capital, we are also looking at improving operating costs, so we are trying to add to the bottom of the line from a value perspective.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Right. And at Akyem, if you do have a construction decision in Q3 this year, when would production sort of be expected or what is the sort of time horizon there?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, at present, we are targeting late 2013, but that could float into 2014. The critical part for us is going to be relocation and land access. So we will get a better feel for that through this phase of the project.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Have the power issues been sorted out in terms of the reliability and quality of power that you need here?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, this is Richard. I think, Patrick, the answer to that is yes and the reasons are varied, but at this point, we have not really had issues with respect to the power at Ahafo, and a lot of that is power or hydro availability has gone up. But in this timeframe, most importantly, there has been a significant discovery of oil and gas off the shore of Ghana, and under the rules that Ghana uses with respect to the UN, they will be not allowed to flare that gas, bringing it on board, there is permitting going on for gas plants. So we actually see additional infrastructure investment in electricity generation in Ghana. So I think the confluence of that timing and the production of the team, I think we will line up pretty well. We will have backup diesel facilities there, but hopefully, we won't need to use them.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Excellent. And just a final one on Boddington. You touched upon some extra success you are getting. Could you give us an idea what sort of scope that would be in terms of you know, size potential or grade?
Guy Lansdown: Patrick, this is Guy. We are currently focusing our exploration efforts on the Northeast part of the pit, where we are hopeful that we will get some material of higher grades than current, and from our initial exploration results, we are pretty hopeful that it will turn out that way.
Richard O'Brien: I would just add to that that I think in the larger district, one of the things that the team down there has been able to do is get some work on the tenements, which as you know, if you have been in Australia, is an important thing to be able to get completed with bauxite and some of the other issues in the area. For us to proceed with exploration outside of the existing operating pit, and I think those are plans that you will see the benefit over the next couple of years.
Patrick Chidley -- Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Okay, great. All right, thanks very much.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Lane Adler [ph], your line is open.
Lane Adler: Hey, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. I realize there is a limit to what you can say here, but could you review your M&A strategy and how motivated you are, what kind of targets, what kind of timing we can expect?
Richard O'Brien: Our aim is to dominate the world. What I would say is that -- and I can turn this over to Randy in a minute, but as a broad brush look, we understand that to build this business, we have to both develop our own projects, we have to continue to explore our end and Guy mentioned about $200 million on our exploration on our own stuff, both Greenfield and near mine, but we also know we have to do acquisitions from time to time. We are going to continue to be value-oriented; it is not as if we haven’t looked. Last year, we completed a $1 billion acquisition pretty quietly I think, at a very good price when we got the Boddington deal. I think going forward, Randy and his team, the rest of the management team, we are committed to building the business and at some point, we will do a deal. Randy, you want to talk for a minute about what it might look like?
Randy Engel: Yes, I think we would just look for the usual characteristics that just about all of our peers are looking for, looking to enhance our grade. We are looking to extend our average mine life. We are certainly looking to do those in more favorable jurisdictions. You see, our last two transactions were done in AAA-rated jurisdictions like Hope Bay, like Boddington, but we are willing to go into places we haven't gone before. And we look for synergies, and we look to do that on an accretive basis. So it is a fairly common checklist, we recognize we won't hit all of those on any given transaction and we are willing to take some risks.
Richard O'Brien: And just to be clear, I was kidding about the world domination thing. For those of you on the record.
Lane Adler: And second question, if I could get a follow-up. What are your thoughts on hedging; I can understand why you might not want to hedge gold, but how about diesel or currencies, what is your latest thinking on hedging?
Russell Ball: Yes, hi, this is Russ. We do have an active Aussie dollar hedging program in particular, that is nice end of money. We do a little bit on some of the diesel and energy, and have looked at a number of other options. I guess the high level of strategy is trying to manage the volatility around costs, so we are looking to not time the market as much as we are looking to remove the peak, install the valley. So you won't see us taking any huge one directional bets, but over time, managing volatility we think adds value as we continue to deliver on what we say we are going to deliver.
Lane Adler: And I assume there is no change in that. That is sort of your strategy and you are sticking with it and you are not more excited or less excited about that?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I think Russ’ team is really focused on a disciplined execution plan, which means that every once in a while, we might do something other than just reach out a few years in Australia if we see something that we think is opportunistic, but it won't be a big bet. I think legging in is the way we will do this, and clearly, as Russ said, we are looking at hedging the input cost, we will not hedge our outputs relative to gold and copper. And I think importantly, just there is plenty of information on our hedging in the 10-K document, which was filed last night or this morning, and just there is a lot of disclosure in there around what we are doing and why and you can look at it and see it is fairly consistent.
Lane Adler: Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Additionally, I would say that we do continue to hold our interest in Canadian Oil Sands, and as we have talked about before, while it provides a current cash distribution stream, importantly, the notional value goes up and down, the market value really depending on what the price of oil is. So we have a little bit of an internal edge on that as well.
Lane Adler: Thank you.
Operator: Brian MacArthur, your line is open.
Brian MacArthur -- UBS Securities: Good morning. Not to beat the accounting for Batu Hijau to death here, but can you confirm the $287 million in the fourth quarter going out to buy some shares, I is soon there is nothing else in there that is the $287 million invested in your Indonesian partner. And secondly, I realized you are now giving production and everything on a 52.44 basis. With your CapEx numbers, are they coming in at 52.44, and do you actually fund the partners’ capital first and recover it or how does that all work? Russell Ball Brian, Russ. So the $287 million was the advance at 12/30/09. Subsequent to year end, we have had a small additional advance that was part of a delayed payment. In addition to that, we have had a dividend distribution. So that is roughly about $260 million today. As far as capital, there is significant cash flow coming out of Indonesia, so external financing at least for 2010 and into 2011 is not an issue. So the project self-funds if you want.
Richard O'Brien: The capital number themselves, in our presentation, are all consolidated.
Brian MacArthur -- UBS Securities: Great. Thank you very much, that helped.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard O’Brien.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you very much for your participation on the call today and if you have questions or want to follow up, please don't hesitate to call John or Randy or anybody on the team here, and we look forward to seeing you in the near future. Thanks.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Executives: John Seaberg - VP of Investor Relations Richard O'Brien - President and CEO Russell Ball - CFO Brian Hill - EVP of Operations Guy Lansdown - EVP of Discovery and Development Randy Engel - EVP of Strategic Development
Analysts: John Bridges - JPMorgan David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Leo Larkin - Standard & Poor's
Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Now, I will turn the meeting over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.
John Seaberg: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are the members of our executive leadership team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. As with all of our earnings calls and presentations, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com. Now I would like to turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, John. I realize a number of you just got off an earnings call and that it's the earnings week and weeks for you guys, so appreciate your time, attention, and interest in Newmont. Those of you with access to our simulcast presentation, I would like to begin on slide three, with the reintroduction of our Executive Management team, including Russell Ball, our Chief Financial Officer, Alan Blank, our Executive Vice President of Legal and External Affairs, Randy Engel, the Executive Vice President of Strategic Development, Brian Hill, the Company's Executive Vice President of Operations, and Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery and Development. Over the last two years, our team from our first line of operators on up to our Board of Directors, has focused on delivering on our plans and doing what we say we're going to do in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, managing our costs and responsibly driving efficiency, providing investors maximum leverage to ongoing strength in the gold price and ensuring ongoing cash flow generation and balance sheet strength so we have the resources to sustain and grow our business. I believe our record third quarter earnings are a testament to this focus, as we delivered on our business plans and expanded our operating margin, thereby offering investors significant per share leverage to the gold price. We were able to do this, thanks to the fact that Newmont eliminated all of our remaining gold hedges in July of 2007, as well as the dedicated efforts of our employees around the globe, who continue to deliver on our plans in a safe, cost-efficient, and environmentally and socially responsible manner. Turning to slide four, as a company, our ability to deliver shareholder value is centered on developing a profitable and sustainable business. We are going to achieve that and provide growth through continued generated and near-mine exploration, development of our internal projects, and from time to time, value enhancing merger and acquisition activities. It's consistent statement that we made since I became CEO. For the quarter, our operations delivered record quarterly consolidated revenue of more than $2 billion, record operating cash flow of more than $1 billion, and record quarterly net income of $388 million. This solid financial performance further strengthened our already strong balance sheet. As previously announced, we are also proud of achieving the first gold poured at Boddington, construction is complete and ramping up very successfully towards full production. We'll have more details on Boddington a little later. In addition, I'm proud to announce once again that Newmont was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year, after having been the first gold company selected for this prestigious designation in 2007. Over time, we believe that by demonstrating industry leadership and environmental and social responsibility, we will gain competitive advantage and position our company for ongoing future success. As new gold deposits become harder to find and develop, when such deposits are discovered, we want local communities and governments to say, if anyone's going to develop this resource, we would like Newmont to do it. I would now like to turn it over to Russell.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Richard. I'm pleased to report, as shown on slide five, a very strong result for the third quarter that built on the first two quarters of solid performance. For the quarter, we sold approximately 1.3 million equity ounces at an average realized gold price of $964/oz at operating cost of about $404/oz. Our gold cost of sales per ounce are down approximately 13% from the third quarter of 2008, as we benefited from higher by-product credits, lower stripping and lower diesel prices. In addition, we sold 64 million equity pounds of copper, an averaged realized price of $2.80/lb from our Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia. As a reminder, we removed the loss of our gold hedged positions in July 2007 when we settled the approximate 1.8 million ounces with gold at approximately $660/oz. Also during the quarter, we strengthened the balance sheet by completing our $2 billion debt offering, giving us the additional firepower to provide growth through a combination of exploration, development of our project pipeline, and acquisition initiatives that may become available, although no specific acquisitions have been currently identified. Recognizing the strength of our core asset base and our operational and financial strength and flexibility, the rating agencies have maintained our investment grade rating, which is a key component of our strategic direction for the company. Looking forward to Q4, gold and copper sales are expected to be slightly higher than our Q3 numbers. You'll see we did provide some revised guidance around CAS towards the lower end, although we are seeing some pressure with FX and diesel, but we do expect another good quarter in the fourth quarter and we'll speak to the Boddington ramp up and the Batu slide in a little bit. We also have provided the [sheet] with a early look at 2010 equity production. We're expecting equity gold production to increase in the order of 5% to 10%, based on higher production from the Boddington operation as it ramps up to full production and at Batu Hijau where we will be in the bottom of Phase 5 slightly offset by lower production in our maturing Nevada and Yanacocha regions. We also expect our cost applicable to sales to be approximately 5% higher next year due to higher energy and FX assumptions, although we're still finalizing our budget and we'll be discussing it in detail with our Board in early December. Slide six illustrates the sources we could utilize to fund organic growth opportunities through a combination of the available liquidity and our strong operating cash flow generation from our existing assets. Guy will speak to this later. Our liquidity position at the end of September is currently in excess of $5 billion and includes approximately $1.5 billion from our undrawn revolving credit facility. With our recent debt financing, we have approximately $2.5 billion in equity, cash, and cash equivalents on hand. In addition, we have in our Canadian oil sands and other equity investments, another potential $1 billion in funds if needed. To be clear, we have no intention of liquidating our interest in costs, we believe the stock is undervalued and provides us a natural hedge for approximately 20% of our diesel exposure. With rising gold prices, we expect to generate approximately $350 million on an after-tax basis in operating cash flow for every $100 move in the gold price. As you saw from our earnings release, we realized the price of about $960/oz with gold trading around a $1,040 today, maintaining financial strength and flexibility and continuing to generate strong cash flow, the vehicles from which we will drive long-term growth for the Company. Slide seven highlights our expected and actual equity gold sales and cost applicable to sales for each of the regions. Across the portfolio, our operations are performing at or above budget for the year, with the expectation of the approximate three-month startup delay at Boddington that Brian will provide more color on shortly. Equity gold sales in North America were higher than anticipated due to a reduction in inventory and higher leach recoveries at Carlin, Yanacocha in Peru. Gold sales were higher during the third quarter due to higher grade and throughput at the gold mill. Higher grades at Jundee, a [drawdown] of in-circuit inventory at Kalgoorlie and higher mill throughput grade and recovery at Batu helped drive equity gold sales and in the case of Batu, copper sales above budget for the Asia-Pacific region. Our costs applicable to sales for the third quarter were approximately 3% below budget, as we benefited from higher production and higher by-product credits and slightly lower [stripping] and diesel prices. As shown in the equity gold sales figure, our original plan is at Boddington to delivering approximately 160,000 ounces during the quarter, while actual production from the mine was only 4,000 ounces due to the startup delay mentioned earlier. We recognize these ounces aren't lost, but rather will be recovered in later years. In addition, our CAS in the APEC region would have been approximately $30/oz lower if you factored in the lower cost ounces coming out of the Boddington in the budget. With the current mine life in excess of 24 years, we are intentionally taking a thoughtful, thorough, and safety first approach to the startup of this large and complex operation. Today, we are extremely happy with the status of the ramp up, and again, Brian will fill you in on more of those details shortly. Slide eight demonstrates our ability to deliver significant cash flow. With 100% of our production unhedged, we provide investors with exposures to the higher gold and copper prices realized during the third quarter. As mentioned earlier by Richard, revenues were in excess of $2 billion. Our costs applicable to sales were down 13% from the year-ago quarter and this combination of providing unhedged exposure to metal prices are focused on plan execution and delivery, and our continuing drive towards cost discipline allowed us to generate record operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion for the quarter. Slide nine reiterates our ability to expand our operating margins and generate significant cash flow. During the third quarter, our operating margin grew to 58% and over the past year, our margins have increased over 40%, with the gold price having had a corresponding 11% increase over the same period. The one thing you get when you buy Newmont, is significant gold price exposure and significant leverage to the gold price, given our unhedged profile. Shown on the figure on the lower part of the slide, on consensus basis, we are projected to deliver the highest cash flow per share from the peer group that you see there over the next couple of years. And with that brief summary of our operating and financial highlights, I'll turn it over to Brian Hill, our EVP of Operations.
Brian Hill: Thank you, Russell. As we turn to Slide ten, I would like to once again thank all our employees for an excellent quarter. The startup of Boddington is a very exciting time for all of us here at Newmont. On September 29, we achieved our first gold poured at Boddington and on September 30, we shipped our first copper concentrate to the port at Bunbury. These are very significant milestones for Boddington and we're extremely proud of these accomplishments. World class Boddington operation will be a cornerstone asset for the company by providing a large, stable production base for many years to come, with a reserve of over 20 million ounces and we continue to see upside in both near mine exploration and in the district for both gold and copper resource additions. As noted previously, we did extend the startup at Boddington during the third quarter as a result of delays in construction completion due to contractor performance and productivity, as well as experiencing some unseasonal weather through the winter period. At the beginning of the quarter, we experienced some differential settlement in our primary crusher tunnel, which did impact the start of the project ramp up. This issue is now behind us and we are continuing to ramp up the operation and are very pleased with the early results we are seeing from the project. The early stages of production are advancing well and recoveries for gold and copper are approaching designed expectations. Earlier this month, we achieved our best daily mill throughput to date, with 60,000 tons milled, which is roughly 60% of the designed capacity and we are consistently operating above 50% design throughput. The Boddington is tracking very favorably when compared with mining projects of a similar size and complexity. All the major process equipment is performing at or above expectations, with specific mention to the HPGRs and the [ball] mills, which are performing very well. We reached design tonnage on three of the four mills and are ramping up the fourth mill as we speak. The HPGRs are performing well and in fact, we're pleased to see we still have some capacity in this circuit as we are drawing less power from the HPGRs than anticipated. We do expect commercial production to occur sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Turning to slide 11, as previously announced, we experienced a geotechnical failure in the west wall of the Batu Hijau pit on September 18. As evidenced in the photograph, the slope failure encompassed a 200-meter wide area over about a 270 meter depth from the intersection of the north and south pit access ramp. Our geotechnical monitoring system provided sufficient warning to allow for all personnel and mining equipment, as well as key electrical and de-watering infrastructure to be evacuated or relocated well in advance of the slope failure. The remediation activities commenced on the 28th of September and included trimming back the upslope to restore the necessary widths to the north ramp, as well as cutting out and back filling the displaced materials to provide stability to the ramp. The remediation work was completed on October 10, and mining operations resumed again on October 11. During the remediation, while access to the pit was impacted, we continue to process lower grade ore from the stock piles. Due to the efforts of our team, the remediation efforts were completed safely and efficiently as possible. As previously mentioned, the impact on 2009 gold and copper production is expected to be minimal and the company continues to expect equity gold and copper sales from the mine of between 225,000 ounces and 210 million to 230 million pounds respectively. In operations, we've placed a real significant focus on driving business excellence throughout the Company during 2009, and that contributed to our better than projected cost and production performance. To give you an example, we have a mine-to-mill project at our Ahafo operation in Ghana, which has led to increased mill throughput by focusing on our blast pattern design to optimize fragmentation and refining our grinding media size and charge to improving grinding efficiencies. We expect to see further improvements, both in this operation and [otherwise] around the world. Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of our operations team through the first nine months of the year, as essentially all operations in the portfolio have performed at or better than expectations in terms of both ounce production and cost applicable to sale. I'm now going to turn the presentation over to Guy Lansdown, our Executive Vice President of Discovery and Development.
Guy Lansdown: Thank you, Brian. Good morning. Slide 12 highlights some of our major internal projects which we are currently advancing. As we outlined at the Denver Gold Show in September, we have multiple opportunities for organic -- Nevada we have a portfolio of over 18 projects, from exploration through to the advance stages of development that provide the opportunity for up to 7 million ounces of new reserves that will leverage our existing infrastructure and the technical expertise of our employees to provide additional production beginning in 2011 at competitive costs. Also in North America, at Hope Bay, we have leveraged our expanded infrastructure to complete a cutting edge framework study reinforcing our positive view of this 80 kilometer underexplored greenstone belt. We believe the next step in the development of this district is initiation of an underground [deacon] and drilling followed by production. We will provide more details on our plans as we progress. We are also excited about our projects in Ghana, including Akyem and the (inaudible) expansion project we are preparing to follow an underground exploration deacon. We continue to advance the 7.7 million ounce Akyem project working closely with the government of Ghana to obtain the mining lease. Once this milestone is achieved, we are poised to advance the project quickly. Finally, in South America, we are pursuing multiple opportunities, including development of the Conga gold-copper pour free district as well as advancing the sulfide resources within the Yanacocha district. Turning on to slide 13, this provides an update on our Akyem project in Ghana. We received approval of our environmental impact statement earlier this year and we are working closely with the government of Ghana to obtain our mining lease. Once we reach that milestone with our advanced engineering and study work at Akyem we have the opportunity to advance the project quickly through stage four, after which we would make a development decision. We will build on the experience we have gained at Ahafo and leverage our current infrastructure and resources during the development and operation of Akyem. If we receive the mining lease and we make a development decision by mid 2010, we expect first production in late 2013 or 2014. The mine is expected to produce between 480,000 and 550,000 ounces of gold per annum for the first five years of operation, with average costs applicable to sales of between $350/oz and $450/oz. The life of mine is about 15 years, with an initial capital investment estimated between $0.7 billion and $1 billion, excluding capitalized interest. As we advance toward development, we are continuing our infill drilling program, which is about 40% complete and is showing promising results. Turning to slide 14, I would like to update on you our Conga project that we are advancing to Gate 3 in our Stage-Gate process, which will provide a feasibility decision by the end of this year. At Conga, located near our existing Yanacocha operations in Peru, we continue to pursue the opportunity to expand our production, between 650,000 ounces and 750,000 ounces of gold, and 160 million and 210 million pounds of copper per annum for the first five years of operation on 100% basis. We expect the project to start up in late 2014 or 2015, depending on Peruvian approval and the development decision, with a mine life of more than 20 years. We expect our average costs applicable to sales to be $300/oz to $400/oz for gold and $0.95/lb to $1.25/lb for copper during the first five years. The revenue split is approximately 50/50. Our initial capital estimate for the project excluding capitalized interest is between $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion on a 100% basis. We are leveraging our existing Yanacocha operations and taking advantage of the market conditions to reduce capital, while aggressively advancing the permitting process. We are increasing our exploration efforts in the Conga district. The next phase of the drilling program has started and we see significant long-term reserve expansion potential within this district. Finally, I want to mention our increased focus on innovation, a traditional Newmont strength, which we are reinvigorating across our business. We are establishing a process to harness and implement new ideas globally, leveraging leading practices from across industries. Innovation sessions at each of our projects are adding tangible value in our quest to discover and develop value-adding assets more efficiently and at lower costs than our competitors. Our innovation program also targets game-changing activities. For example, new processes to profitably extract gold from our sulfide ores in Yanacocha. We are excited with these efforts and I will be updating you on our progress in the future. I will now hand it back to Richard, who will provide some concluding comments.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, guys, to the rest of our team here for assisting me on the call today. I believe that in investing in Newmont, you get a couple of things. First, focus on operational execution. We deliver on what we say we're going to do. You see our production coming in as advertised, even above other than at Boddington. We're delivering on costs. We have an energized and very effective management team and I emphasize the word team. We're working together to deliver shareholder value here. We're providing growth, year-on-year growth in production, as Russell mentioned. As Guy talked about, we have a pipeline of tangible projects that will bring real value and growth to our investors. I'm very pleased with the performance for the quarter, but even more pleased with the outlook for the Company. With that, I want to express our thanks and appreciation for you to listening today. For those of you who have not invested in Newmont for a while, this is the time. So I appreciate your time and attention, and we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions).Our first question is from John Bridges with JPMorgan.
John Bridges : You've been delivering some nice improvements in the cost performance. I just wondered there, Richard, how much more do you think there is there?
 JPMorgan: You've been delivering some nice improvements in the cost performance. I just wondered there, Richard, how much more do you think there is there?
Richard O’Brien: Well, John, as Brian mentioned, we have an ongoing effort on business excellence and I would say we're really just getting under way and a lot of our gains over the last two years have come from a focus on delivering on current results and really relative to current budgets. I expect that Brian and his team will be providing new levels of reduced costs in the budgets over the next couple of years. While I can't put a dollar number on it today, I would tell you that I think we have a long way to go in terms of operational improvements that we can make while continuing to focus on delivering production. So, I think there are still viable opportunities that will impact CAS going forward in the next several years.
John Bridges : Okay, great. And then with the projects that you've got in front of you, I know you're still looking at them, but are you in a position to sort of rank them as to the ones you like most yet?
 JPMorgan: Okay, great. And then with the projects that you've got in front of you, I know you're still looking at them, but are you in a position to sort of rank them as to the ones you like most yet?
Richard O’Brien: I tell you that Akyem and Conga are the two that rank at the very top for us because I think we're generating community support because of the good practices we've had in both of those districts. I think both of them provide nice economic returns for the company, even at lower gold prices than what we're seeing today and with that, they continue to broaden the districts, both in Africa, Ghana in particular and in Peru, so I think both of those projects rate right up at the top for us and I would say it's really a race for us to get the necessary approval to begin development of those projects.
Operator: Our next question is from David Haughton, BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton : I wonder if you could remind us the status of the Batu Hijau selldown.
 BMO Capital Markets: I wonder if you could remind us the status of the Batu Hijau selldown.
Richard O’Brien: It's a constantly moving target, so what I would tell you is that we currently are in negotiations with the government to continue to deliver on our promise as a result of the arbitration decision that came out in March to sell to the local government, the first 10% from 2007. At this point, we have been told that the central government will take those up. The deadline is still November 12 for these agreements to be reached. I can tell you our team is ready, willing and able to deliver on those and we still have a little bit of negotiating going on in the various agreements that we have and we are ready to offer the first 10% at the fixed price that the arbitration panel put out there. We're ready to do that today and still trying to figure out the agreement with the central government, but I think we're making progress on both of those, we stand ready to do what we have told the government and we're just really waiting for them to get the agreements in place and to provide the funds necessary to make this transaction work.
David Haughton : So the ball is very much in the government's court at this stage and I guess we'll hear an update in the next two weeks or so?
 BMO Capital Markets: So the ball is very much in the government's court at this stage and I guess we'll hear an update in the next two weeks or so?
Richard O’Brien: I would expect that's true. Russ, you are going to add?
Russell Ball: Just for your information, we did provide some enhanced disclosure on Page 45 and 57 of the Q that was filed late last night and I think it was posted early this morning, so you'll see some more language in there that brings you right up to date on where we're at.
David Haughton : The other thing is that with these two projects that we've seen and the numbers that you provided us with, are they fresh numbers? Have they been revised on your cost and OpEx expectations based on prevailing numbers today, or are they a little bit older from that?
 BMO Capital Markets: The other thing is that with these two projects that we've seen and the numbers that you provided us with, are they fresh numbers? Have they been revised on your cost and OpEx expectations based on prevailing numbers today, or are they a little bit older from that?
Guy Lansdown: We mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were going to sit back and look at what the current environment would do to impact our operating and capital costs. We've worked diligently at that and indeed they are the latest numbers that we have. We've seen very pleasing results in our capital numbers coming down on both of those projects as well we've seen our operating costs improve compared to what we had a year ago when we were in a much more volatile market. They are the latest numbers that we're carrying.
Richard O’Brien: It's a pretty wide band, when we talk about the development of Conga of $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion in initial capital. That wide band is purposeful because we're still moving into stage 4, where we'll really tighten that up with the feasibility study. At this point, Guy and his team have done a bunch of work around the range. We feel good with the range. Obviously as we move on, we'll be able to tighten that for you.
David Haughton : Does that suggest there's some scaling options you're still considering?
 BMO Capital Markets: Does that suggest there's some scaling options you're still considering?
Guy Lansdown: Not at this stage. We've pretty much settled on the throughputs and the design, the opportunities that we would be focusing on because we're not going to let up on opportunities or seeing what we can do to improve our efficiency for execution and that's both from a schedule and a cost perspective, we're going work hard at trying to reduce both of those, the capital and the delivery timeframe. As well, we're working very closely in partnership with our operations folks on what we might do to continue to improve on our operating costs.
Richard O’Brien: Just with respect to Conga, one scale item still to be determined is potential sharing of infrastructure in the region, there are several other projects and our plans that we have today do not show benefits from that. I know Guy and the team and in particular the team down in Yanacocha and Conga are focused on, to the extent we can work with other people developing mines in the area, we'll do so.
David Haughton : To another project not mentioned, what's your thinking on Hope Bay at the moment?
 BMO Capital Markets: To another project not mentioned, what's your thinking on Hope Bay at the moment?
Guy Lansdown: On Hope Bay, we continue to evaluate our options. Now that we've got ourselves well established in the area with infrastructure, we will continue to explore. We're looking at a 4 million ounce to 9 million-ounce resource and our current thinking is that we would look to get a better understanding of the resource out there by driving a [decon] at some point in the future. We believe that's most probably the option that we would look at from there, get a better understanding of the resources and the conditions underground and then take it on into production. We're pretty early in the stage of looking at those options and we'll update you as we go along, that's kind of the way we're headed at present, looking at starting off with an underground decon much the same as we're doing at Subika.
David Haughton : Will that underground decon would be designed to potentially be a production decon?
 BMO Capital Markets: Will that underground decon would be designed to potentially be a production decon?
Guy Lansdown: Absolutely, yes, that's what we have in mind at both Subika and at Hope Bay. They present a number of opportunities for us. They help us get down there and understand what's down there from a geotechnical and geohydrological perspective. It's a better platform from which to explore and we're expecting that penning success, we can go straight on into production from those decons.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Patrick Chidley, Barnard Jacobs Mellet.
Patrick Chidley : In Australia, Jundee seems to be producing some good results, is that operation going to continue with the sort of current rates into next year? Is that one of the expectations?
 Barnard Jacobs Mellet: In Australia, Jundee seems to be producing some good results, is that operation going to continue with the sort of current rates into next year? Is that one of the expectations?
Brian Hill: We are expecting to see Jundee continue to perform. One of the main issues at Jundee is the mine is very high grade, very narrow, very narrow [vein], you need to get on the vein to ultimately get your reserve grade that you're going to mine. So we do see a number of swings and roundabouts, we're in a period where keying on left side, we're actually seeing some significant positive reconciliation. That does have the potential to turn on us, but, we are still expecting a good next year out of Jundee and looking at some additional potential extensions at the operation as well.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: You've had quite a bit of exploration success that you talked about I think earlier this year?
Brian Hill: We have. It's been a real success story for relatively smaller underground operation.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: On Ahafo recovery, Ahafo went down. I understand you did do some stockpile reprocessing and just wondering why you were doing that. Is that sort of taking advantage of gold prices or was there some other reason?
Brian Hill: No, it was really around some of the sequencing issues and some dewatering issues that we had to do in the pit and so it was really an issue of having to get into some stockpile while we finished off some dewatering, dewatering activities to get the bottom of the pit exposed again so we could get back to mining fresh ore.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Presumably you got through the wet season now there and should the higher grades and higher recoveries in the next quarter, this quarter?
Brian Hill: Yes, absolutely, and we're still projecting Ahafo to perform as expected for the year.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: The [Callie] underground, are you going to go through a little bit of detail on that? Can you give us some updates on what the plan is and how long it will take to get into that?
Guy Lansdown: We've got a decon plant for the early part of next year. It's a project which currently sits in stage 2, so we've got requests now for proposals. We're looking to award a contract shortly and similar to Hope Bay, we would get down as soon as we can, get an understanding of what's down there again from a resource and a geotechnical perspective and continue to move on into production with positive results.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: You have a resource there already. What would be the average grade of the underground that you are considering there?
Guy Lansdown: We are looking at around grades, from current drilling and on NRM of the order of five to seven gram a ton, but again, early days, we still got to go down and confirm that, which is the reason for the decon.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: One more question about new projects and you’ve already mentioned 18 projects in Nevada. Can you give us some highlights to get to potentially 7 million new ounces in the reserves?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, we're looking at up to 7 million ounces. Some of the bigger projects that are out there are Gold Quarry, West Wall, which we're drilling as we speak. Turf is a very exciting one, which is an expansion to our Leeville mine. Emigrant is another one of the bigger ones and then there are a number of expansions to and new underground operations and pits, what's exciting for us is to bring them into production in the near term.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Some of those, even as near as 2011?
Guy Lansdown: Other than next year or so we would be looking at the opportunity to bring some of the projects into operation. So, we have 18 projects and they comprise early stage projects right the way to advanced project.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: You have a couple of joint ventures in Nevada that could add some incremental production. Can you maybe give us some more color on those?
Russell Ball: Are you referencing Hollister?
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: No, actually there seem to be a couple of other ones that have propped up. Sandman would be one of them and some others.
Russell Ball: In our plan, it’s just the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with Barrick and there's a little bit of toll milling that we're going for Great Basin, but at the end of the day, they just don't move the needle on roughly 2 million ounce base in Nevada and the folks there are continuing to look at other opportunities.
Richard O’Brien: The other projects are all ours.
Richard O’Brien: And I would just say that Nevada's a great example of what consistent delivery on plans can do for us. These guys have had an opportunity to look more out into the future, identify these projects as helping to offset some of what people believe to be and it clearly is a mature region for us, but these projects will help reenergize that region, provide growth in the region, and I think continue to spread costs and hopefully reduce our costs over a larger base of operations as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Heather Douglas from Thomas Weisel.
Heather Douglas : First, can you review what the permitting steps will be for Conga, it's been a while since you've had to permit something in Peru, how far along are you already?
Thomas Weisel: First, can you review what the permitting steps will be for Conga, it's been a while since you've had to permit something in Peru, how far along are you already?
Guy Lansdown: We are currently preparing for the gate 3. As part of that, we are putting together our permit application. We submit that and at the moment we could expect anywhere between a year and 18 months to go through that process. We are working as diligently as we can to put it together and then to expedite it.
Heather Douglas : Russell was talking about sort of three-pronged growth strategy and you always mention acquisitions. What kind of acquisitions would you not consider as sort of major development, or are there any regions that are no-go regions?
Thomas Weisel: Russell was talking about sort of three-pronged growth strategy and you always mention acquisitions. What kind of acquisitions would you not consider as sort of major development, or are there any regions that are no-go regions?
Randy Engel: Really there are no no-go regions for us. What we try to do is take a look those acquisition opportunities that can increase our average life or assets that could improve our cost base on margin on leverage, but really if it's something that is encouraging in those asset characteristics first, that's what we look at. Then we'll take a look at the balance of political risks and other risks.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel: Do you have a preferred stage of development? Would you like it to have something that already has the feasibility on it, or Hope Bay was quite early stage?
Randy Engel: We like it all near our existing mines. We like it now and we've got a preference obviously for those opportunities that are closer to production or in production.
Heather Douglas : What is the definition of commercial production that you'll be using to bring Boddington into commercial production?
Thomas Weisel: What is the definition of commercial production that you'll be using to bring Boddington into commercial production?
Russell Ball: It's actually 70% of design, which if you look at the numbers, we were roughly at 60%, so about 70,000 tons a day on an extended basis. We'll be there sometime towards the middle of next month or the end of next month. Again, the final capital estimate is going to be and our full final capital cost will be a function of when we declare commercial production. That's largely moving operating costs into capital and vice versa. The spend is essentially done as far as work going on in the field. Sometime in the fourth quarter, again, they have had a nice run, but as Brian mentioned, we have to get line 4 up and see the project perform for a couple of week period realistically. That's our definition, some where around 70. There are some different constraints that we use, meet the accounting definition, but that's really the key one, 70% for an extended period.
Heather Douglas : Does that mean for first quarter 2010, we should be prepared for high costs, because you have 70% of throughput, but likely 100% of costs?
Thomas Weisel: Does that mean for first quarter 2010, we should be prepared for high costs, because you have 70% of throughput, but likely 100% of costs?
Russell Ball: We do have a 12-month ramp up curve. As Brian said, we're tracking right in line with certainly our experience at Batu Hijau and we'll continue to ramp up. So what you'll see in 2010 is not a full year of the million ounce a year, but having said that, while you will see some higher costs on denominated basis, we're seeing higher copper and the concentrate and certainly at $3 or wherever we're going to be next year, copper, that helps keep the cost in line with our original estimates. We haven't seen anything that we believe puts the guidance out there at risk.
Operator: Our next question is from Leo Larkin, Standard & Poor's.
Leo Larkin : Is there any guidance for copper equity sales in 2010 you gave guidance for gold.
 Standard & Poor's: Is there any guidance for copper equity sales in 2010 you gave guidance for gold.
Russell Ball: No, we didn't put any out. We're still working through our budget. It will go to the Board in early December. The issue we're dealing with is the geotechnical slip at Batu and just finalizing what that impact is going to be. I will say, and we've said this to the (inaudible), we will be in the bottom of Phase 5 next year, which will be a good year for us. The mine does go through some extended stripping and then some high-grade production out of the bottom of the pit. We will be in the bottom of the pit, so it will be a good year, but we haven't finalized the numbers. That's why we didn't give you anything on copper that is still working through the finalization of their mine plans for the year.
Richard O’Brien: Once again, I want to thank the management team and all of our employees for delivery of the great quarter and I want to thank all of you for taking time out of your busy reporting week to listen to our call. So with that, have a great day. Thanks.

Operator:  Welcome, thank you all for standing by. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the meeting over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO. Thank you, sir, you may begin.
Richard O'Brien:  Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our conference call to discuss Newmont's financial results for the second quarter of 2009. With me today are several members of our management team, who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation, and I'll ask them to identify themselves when they do so. As with our previous earnings call, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com. I'd just add to that an continued interest in providing increased timely and visible information to our business. Our 10-Q was filed last night. I just wanted to acknowledge the hard work of our accounting, financing tax staff (inaudible). Thanks to all of you, and some of you are probably on the phone. For those of you with access to our simulcast presentation, I'd like to start with some comments on slide three. As we look at the second quarter highlights, I am pleased to report solid operating and financial results and result of our ongoing focus on operational and project execution. Our second quarter performance builds on results from the first, and provides the base from which we can deliver on our operating plans for 2009. Completing the successful transition of Boddington Project construction development to startup is our major focus during this first half of 2009. During the second quarter, the dry plant of Boddington was commissioned, which is now operational. Commissioning of the wet plant was initiated and is continuing, while the schedule for this work has put by approximately one month, we are expecting further concentrate to be produced in August, followed by first gold production (inaudible). With the startup of the first two mills at Boddington underway, we continue to anticipate a 12 months ramp up schedule towards the full production from all 4 mils. I'll provide more details on Boddington later in the presentation. In terms of our second quarter financial and operating results, we delivered equity gold sales of approximately 1.2 million ounces at an average realized price of $915 per ounce, and costs applicable to sales of $423 per ounce, which is down about 4% from the prior year's quarter. Also during the quarter, we sold 47 million pounds of copper at an averaged realize price of $2.17 per pound and our costs applicable to sales of $0.58 per pound from our Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia. We have made considerable progress with regards to our divestiture obligation to Batu Hijau, which I'll cover later. We continue to believe that a primary driver of long-term value for Newmont is cash flow generation. During the quarter, we generated cash flow from continuing operations of $503 million or $1.03 per share. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $213 million or $0.43 per share, compared to $0.50 per share for the second quarter of 2008. This reduction is primarily driven by lower realized copper prices and the significantly higher tax rate, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower unit costs. Net income from continuing operations on GAAP basis was $171 million or $0.35 per share compared with GAAP net income of $270 million or $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2008. The primary driver of the difference was the $0.28 per share income tax recorded a year-ago quarter as well as the items I just mentioned related to adjusted net income. As we turn slide four, our equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales by region, we are performing in line with our expectations. In Nevada, we sold 415,000 ounces slightly below our expectations, primarily due to lower throughput and grades at Mill 6 and for lower production at Midas due to the suspension of mining activities following a ground failure which curtailed production for most of April. Costs applicable to sales were lower than expected to $549 per ounce due to higher by-product credits and lower milling costs, partially offset by lower than gold sales. At Yanacocha higher leach pad production as well as higher grades and throughput at the gold mill resulted in higher than expected gold sales of 274,000 ounces. Costs applicable to sales at Yanacocha $323 per ounce were in line with our expectations, as the benefits from higher gold sales were offset by higher royalties and worker's participation cost, resulting from higher realized gold prices and lower by-product credits.  In our Australia/New Zealand region, equity gold sales of 283,000 ounces were also above expectations due to higher grades and recoveries at Jundee partially offset by lower production at Waihi in New Zealand, following an electrical fire at the mill in early May, which halted production for the remainder of the quarter. We expects the mill repairs to be completed in August. Higher gold sales during the second quarter favorably impacted costs applicable to sales of $500 per ounce. At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, equity gold sales of 48,000 ounces were in line with our expectations while costs applicable to gold sales of $229 per ounce were lower than expected due to lower allocation of cost to gold as a result of higher copper prices in co-product accounting. Equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales at Ahafo in Ghana with 132,000 ounces at $428 per ounce were in line with expectations. Equity gold sales in our other category, are primarily from La Herradura in Mexico, which contributed 31,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $398 per ounce. As noted in our press release this morning and in our 10-Q, we sold our 88% interest in Kori Kollo in Bolivia to a company controlled by our long-time Bolivian partner will assume all obligations at the operation exchanges for royalties on future production. As part of the transaction, we will establish a reclamation trust fund in the amount of approximately $14 million, the proceeds of which will be made available only to pay for closure and reclamation costs when operations eventually cease. As mentioned on our first quarter call, our operating performance for 2009 is skewed for the last six months of the year, primarily due to the ramp up of Boddington mine sequencing at Yanacocha, , no shut downs in Nevada in the second quarter for planned maintenance activities and the traditional production benefits from the dry season at Batu Hijau in the third and the fourth quarter. Again, I would like to reiterate that while we recognize that quarterly fluctuations will occur, we continue to drive our business toward meeting and exceeding our annual guidance. Slide five demonstrates our ability to deliver cash flow. Newmont is the world's largest unhedged gold producer provides our investors with [good exposure] to the gold price. During the second quarter, we generated over $1.6 billion in revenues with over 85% attributable to gold sales. This exposure to the gold price coupled with our drive towards cost discipline into a continuing focus on plan execution and delivery allowed us to generate $503 million in operating cash flow and continuing operations during the second quarter. Turning to slide six, we have revised our outlook for both gold sales and capital expenditures for 2009. We have updated our equity gold sales outlook to 5.2 million ounces to 5.4 million ounces, from 5.2 million ounces to 5.5 million ounces in consideration of operating results in six month's of actual production and volume since July 3. For 2009, our outlook for consolidated capital expenditures has been updated to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion in consideration of item start-up that was partially offset by lower than expected capital expenditures across the rest of our portfolio. For the year, our outlook for costs applicable to sales remain unchanged as between $400 and $440 per ounce with our current forecast assuming oil prices of $70 per barrel and Australian exchange rate of 0.75. As shown on slide seven, we continue to focus on delivering on our plans in a safe and environmentally sound manner and then doing what we say we are going to do. This is the cornerstone to our business and allows us to deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. With the successful turnover to dry plant operations and wet plant commissioning advancing rapidly, we have successfully started to transition Boddington from project construction to startup.  Another key deliverable for us is to fulfill our obligation to Batu Hijau as outlined in the arbitration decision delivered in March of this year. I'm happy to report that we have made significant progress on all of our arbitration obligations. I'll provide further detail on this in a few minutes. We continue to grow and establish our disciplined approach after reevaluating and pursuing the best available internal and external investment opportunities to sustain our business with an ongoing focus on Conga in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada, and Akyem in Ghana. Finally we remain committed to improving our operational and business efficiencies throughout the organization with the ongoing goal to delivering superior leverage to gold prices and improving our financial return. As shown on slide eight, state chart of Boddington is underway. The dry plant which includes the primary crusher, conveyer, [of course] ore feeders and high-pressure grinding rolls has been successfully turned over to our operating personnel. With the delay of the commissioning of the wet plant, we have lowered our expectation for 2009 gold sales from Boddington, primarily as a result of lower productivity associated with a slowdown in the contractor labor market as well as wetter than expected weather conditions. With the introduction of waste rock to the plant, the ramp-up phase of Boddington has commenced. We are expected concentrate to be produced in August followed by gold from leaching and we're still anticipating a 12-month ramp-up schedule for full production. I know many of our employees from around the world listen to our earnings calls, and I want each of you to know how proud you should be that we are bringing up the largest gold-mining operation in Australia, and it has been a combined effort of our team from around the world, and I want to recognize each and everyone of the people at Boddington who have really worked in difficult conditions over the last several months to bring this plant up. And I know everyone down there is looking for the successful completion and transition of the full operation. So, I want to compliment the construction operating teams who have really been slaving away down there to get this done, and it is getting done in style. Slide 9 provides additional details on the current outlook for Boddington. On a 100% basis, capital costs for the construction of Boddington are expected to be between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. This compares to the previous outlook of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. The increase related is just in the [bottom end] is because we are closer to startup, and we have more information available in one month later than previously planned. For the first full five years of production, we still expect annual gold sales of approximately 1 million ounce per year. As viewed on the previous slide, as a result of the change up in start up, we're updating our outlook for gold sales for 2009 for Boddington to between 200,000 ounces and 300,000 ounces from the previous range of 375,000 ounces to 450,000 ounces. We continue to anticipate cost applicable to sales net byproduct credits to be less than $300 per ounce for the first full five years of production. As of the end of 2008, gold reserves at Boddington were approximately 20 million ounces. During the second quarter, following the receipt of Australian and South African regulatory approvals, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold. Associated with the closing, we incurred acquisition fees of approximately $59 million during the second quarter, primarily associated with Australian [boot camp]. The valuation date for the transaction is January 1, 2009, $182 million was repaid in cash to Anglo during the second quarter for their share of year-to-date capital expenditures. Slide 10 provides a brief update on our Conga project in Peru. During 2009, we continue to revalue the project costs under current account or conditions. We are also evaluating synergies associated with leveraging necessary infrastructure and facilities within our existing operations in Yanacocha as well as the neighboring projects in the region. To recap, the project currently has equity reserves of over 6 million ounces and approximately 1.7 billion pounds of copper. During visit to our [exploration camp] in Peru, we had the opportunity to meet many of the residents and leaders of the community surrounding Conga. I was impressed by their strong desire to see this project move forward. Turning to slide 11, in our Akyem project in Ghana we are working with the government to obtain the necessary mining permit following the environmental permit we received later this year. We are currently evaluating development alternatives to focus on leveraging our existing infrastructure and personnel. During 2009, we're completing am infill joint program at Akyem to confirm the resource of over 15,000 meters of drilling completed today.  Slide 12 provides an update on Hope Bay. We just completed the regional framework study that identified 22 new targets across the 80 Km greenstone belt, where we are finding priority targets with additional fieldwork including a ground-based geophysics for drill targeting. We anticipate first pass drill testing on the highest priority targets by the end of this year. Given the existing deposits and exploration upside of the district, we're also focusing on evaluating a range of project-development scenarios to best development potential in this district. These include large open pit to smaller underground and hybrid scenarios with a range of potential mill through puts and locations. We have also completed 35,000 meters of an expanded 45,000 to 55,000 meter development drill program centered around our known deposits of Madrid, Boston, and Doris. Results of this program are anticipated in the third and fourth quarters of this year. All of our exploration programs are being completed safely and efficiently based on our 2008 expanded infrastructure investments at Hope Bay. So in summary, we're moving three projects along. They are all moving along very nicely, and we expect that several of them will progress through our stage-gate through the balance of the year, and we will be giving more information as they do so. Turning to Slide 13, as mentioned on our prior earnings call, the arbitration panel ruled on the Batu Hijau divestiture issue on March 31 of this year. The arbitration ruling outlined multiple obligations to be implemented by the foreign shareholders of PTNNT, ourselves and our partners Sumitomo by the end of September. I'm very pleased to report that we have made significant progress on our obligations. We reimbursed the Government of Indonesia $1.7 million for costs associated with the arbitration. We've insured the release of pledges on 31% of PTNNT shares previously held by the senior lenders. In addition, the 2006 and 2007 shares have been reoffered to the local and regional governments for a $109 million for 3% and $282 million for 7% respectively. Earlier this month through a very collaborative effort between the Government of Indonesia, Sumitomo and ourselves, we agreed on evaluation for Batu Hijau of $3.526 billion. This corresponds to a price of approximately 494 million for the total 14% for the 2008 and 2009 divestiture shares. We offered the 7%, 2008 divestiture shares to the Government of Indonesia, and we're now prepared to transfer the 2006, 2007, 2008, and the 2009 shares as we move forward. To summarize the status of the divestiture obligations to government, we have reached agreement on the price of the 2008 shares. We're now awaiting the national, and regional, and local governments to designate buyers for these buyers to actually pay for their respective divestiture shares. As noted on this slide, the Government of Indonesia must transfer the shares. They have to approve those transfers, and we do expect that they'll work cooperatively with us, as we continue to move forward. Throughout the divestiture process, we've been committed to working with the Indonesian government for the divestiture provisions as defined in the contract to work with (inaudible). As we've always said, we are willing to live up to our obligations under the contracted work, and we just need to know to whom we need to sell these shares, and at this point we have done everything that we need to do and we are waiting for the Government of Indonesia now to provide us with additional instructions. So, we appreciate our relationship with the Government of Indonesia, and the fact that we are able to reach agreement on several of these matters in a very timely fashion. So we now look to focus on the long-time success of Batu Hijau while maintaining the same high operating and safety standards that we have adhered to since that operation began over 10 years ago. Finally, on slide 14, with everything that we do, making sure that all of our operations perform as expected, we continue to focus on our environmental and social responsibility and obligations, as well as ensuring that each of our employees goes home uninjured at the end of the day, our first priority. And with that, I'd like to thank you all for listening, and open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our first question is from John Bridges, JPMorgan.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: Just wanted to say, congratulations on the progress at Yanacocha. This high level of production, is this something which we can expect to carry on into subsequent years, or is that just a one-off?
Richard O'Brien: John, let me just say, first, we're not really giving estimates out beyond the end of this year. We did have a good production quarter at Yanacocha. Let me turn it over to Brian. He can just talk a little bit about how our gold mill is operating and why production is up a little bit this quarter. So, Brian?
Brian Hill: We had a good start for the gold mill and it does continue to outperform. It is performing for a 5% to 10% range on throughput, little higher than expected, and we have been experiencing some higher ore grades to the mill. It's not a trend, as Richard reiterated, that we are expecting to see on a longer term. It's really just more of function of sequencing and where we are in the various pits at the mine.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: As a follow-up, you are further down the line with investigating your projects at Conga and Hope Bay, what do you think Richard now in terms of build or buy in this crazy market that we're participating in?
Richard O'Brien: John great question, build or buy, I think the answer is, these big [64-65 can], because I think it really is important. As we've talked about before that we build this business through a combination of exploration, project development, and selective M&A, and I think we continue to look into the marketplace to see if there are available opportunities. There have been several out there, none of which have really interested us to-date, but I guarantee you, we look hard every day to see if there is something out there that we should avail ourselves of and we hope that as we continue to perform on the operating side that our share price reflects the success of that and we enable ourselves to do more overtime in that marketplace.
John Bridges - JPMorgan: I'll look forward to seeing Boddington up and running at year-and the results will come out of that.
Operator: Your next question is from Heather Douglas, Thomas Weisel Partners. Your line is open.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: I have a question about Boddington, I was wondering if you can give us a little guidance on how you expect the throughput to ramp up over the next 12 months to 18 months, and the same with recoveries? And the other question with Boddington, can you remind us what the average copper production will be in the first five years?
Richard O'Brien: Let me turn my question over to Guy Lansdown and Tom McCauley who is our Project Manager down at Boddington.
Guy Lansdown: Hi Heather, this is Guy. Heather, as far as the ramp-up goes, we are currently in the process that we're undertaking and process has started. We've got the dry plants up and running. As Richard said the next goal is to get the wet plant up and running. It is a 12-month ramp up period to get a full production. We're looking around a year from now. We would expect the plant to be up and running at full capacity.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Is it a straight line though. I don't think it is but Q1 tends to be at 50% throughput achievable by that point.
Guy Lansdown: No, it's not a straight line, Heather. It's a stiff curve. There are about 4 mils we started sequentially and we expect to ramp-up gradually, although it appears that it won't be a straight line.
Richard O'Brien: At this point, Heather, I'd say we're probably estimating commercial production later in the year, potentially in the November timeframe. So, if you think about, as things start to ramp up, that's sort of our expectation at the moment.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: What about on the recovery side?
Guy Lansdown: On the copper side, Heather, to answer your question, we're expecting around 30,000 ton a year of copper.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. 30,000 tons of copper.
Guy Lansdown: That's for the first five years.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Metallurgical recoveries, does it ramp up as well, like should we expect them to be quite weak initially?
Guy Lansdown: It would be lower initially and the ramp-up curve takes account of that. The ramp-up curve is focused on gold production, copper production, but (inaudible) initially not be as in line with ultimate expectations.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: I do have a final question. Overall, can you tell us what your third quarter guidance for production and costs will be?
Richard O'Brien: We actually don't give guidance by quarter for our production. I think if you take the balance of the year, you could assume that we have higher production at Batu Hijau as we move further into the year. You could also assume that Boddington, of course, will have higher production as we move further into the year. Probably no real changes in Nevada at the rate of operation, although the second quarter is generally lower due to mill maintenance. The Yanacocha will be experiencing wetter weather during the year. So, we probably will see lower production in Yanacocha as we move the year down. Q4 likely to be greater than Q3 when you just look at it that way at the balance of the year. Figure out we're going to hit our estimates, because we are, then you can kind of get to that.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: And on Slide 4, you showed us what your expectation is for Q2, but of course we didn't know what your expectation is for Q3?
Richard O'Brien: Right , but we do. We manage very closely to our expectations. We give you an expectation for the year.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thank you. Have a good day.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question is from Patrick Chidley from Barnard Jacobs Mellet. Your line is open.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Hi, everybody. Just a couple of questions, just quickly on Nevada. So you have upgraded your forecast for the year by about 100,000 ounces, and I'm just wondering if you could give us more detail on why that is the case suddenly and what did you do there?
Richard O'Brien: Sorry, Patrick, I didn't exactly hear the question, but I think your question is why we changed our production estimate by 100,000 ounces on the high end?
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Yes.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, we brought back the estimate as. A result we really have been able to move Nevada production up, as you'll note in our summary financial outlook. We brought the bottom of the top end down by 100,000 just because of the delay in [bonds]. So, in Nevada, we're expecting a little more production from the Deep Post than we would have originally expected during the year. That operation continues to go well. We still have access to the portals. So that's going a little longer than we had planned and that's probably one of the bigger reasons for why we are where we are in Nevada.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: So, mostly Deep Post and high production at Deep Post?
Richard O'Brien: Mostly and a little bit around some other operations in Nevada. It's a larger operation. I'm just giving you the primary reason in Deep Post, but there are other operations in that that are pushing up their production slightly as we move into the second half.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Okay. That's taking into account the fact that Midas has been affected. 
Richard O'Brien: Yes, Midas is already back in operations. I mentioned it was shut down for most of April, but in the beginning of May its come back on, no issues, things continue to go. Brian was just telling me actually no operational performance and Nevada is expected to continue to being optimized over the balance of the year, and that will help as well. So we've got a number of things going on in Nevada as you know. It's a complicated operation. There are a number of things that go into both things that could happen and both positive and negative. As we look towards the balance of the year, we have more positive things than we were expecting, and that's the primary reason.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Correct. Just quickly on exploration., I thought I noticed that you've increased the budget for exploration slightly, and this quarter it was quite a lot more than last quarter. Is there any new projects going on there or is this just a reevaluation of the currently ongoing projects you'd identified at the beginning of the year?
Guy Lansdown: We have increased our guidance slightly and that's because of our focus on Hope Bay. There we're putting more dollars into exploration. We're increasing our targeted drills mainly from about 35,000 to about 55,000 meters for the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Barry Cooper, CIBC. Your line is open
Barry Cooper - CIBC: Just wondering the September deadline for activity at Batu Hijau there for a while, what happens if that passes?
Richard O'Brien: Barry, that's a good question, and it's one that I wish I could give you a definitive answer to. What I will tell you is that so far the government and Newmont have both been working, knowing that there is a deadline out there. I think that everybody realizes there's a deadline out there. I see lots of support to get things done on this side of the deadline. Anything can happen though, and I think we continue to look at what might happen. At this point, I'll tell you both the government and Newmont, as well as our partner Sumitomo are really focused on hitting the deadline. If something does happen, we'll update you then as to what options are available. I hope that we don't reach that. That's my ultimate desire here. I don't like hope as a business plan. So that's why we work very closely with the government to try to effectuate this in a timely manner.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: So, there is no mechanism for a resolution then in the event of an overrun of the time date?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, actually that's not what I said. What I said was we're working to try to avoid that. I think that there are any number of potential places where we could go for either judicial redress, or if need be, back to the arbitration panel. I don't believe that that's going to be necessary. As I said, I see a high level of cooperation here. We're not spending our time trying to get ready for that event. We're really trying to spend our time making sure that we get this deal done with the government. As you point out, this is a very valuable asset to Newmont. If things don't show the direction that they need to by that time frame; we will, of course, consider every option necessary to protect that asset. That is a backup strategy, though, as opposed to our frontal attack at this point in working closely with the government to make sure we do what they want.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: So, let's assume things get resolved and September 30th deadlines are met, the 24% transfer of ownership, I assume your guidance does not include any of that transfer of ownership in terms of loss of ounces in your guidance numbers. Is that correct?
Richard O'Brien: That is correct. Our guidance doesn't assume the production change, which of course would be a reduction. It also doesn't assume any of the capital or cash that will come in to the company as a result of that sale.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: Right. Then I guess your guidance also includes the non-commercial production coming from Boddington. Is that correct?
Richard O'Brien: Yes. That's true.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: Okay. I guess just based on a couple of other things, I thought that usually July, August were good times for Batu Hijau in the sense that, that was the dry period where you get down to the bottom of the pit and what not. Is that not taking place this year because you implied earlier that Q4 was likely to be better than Q3?
Brian Hill: This year in Batu we're not down in the bottom of the pit. We were in the bottom of the pit last year in Phase 4, and we're expected to be back in the bottom of the pit next year in Phase 5. So, this is the year where we do see the lower copper and lower gold grades because we are higher up in the profile.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: Okay. Good. And then final question, now that Boddington is built, what's the biggest risk that you see in terms of completing it, as I would describe, which basically means that it's up and working?
Guy Lansdown: Barry, our challenge and our big focus will be ramping it up as quick as possible.
Richard O'Brien: I think with 4 mils, I think this will take some time to get up and running smoothly, but one thing I would say is that the question that I was asked along the way here a number of times around the technical complexity of the HPGR, the High Pressure Grinding Rolls. That's probably the number one question, and Guy, you might just talk a little bit about our experience on those at the moment.
Guy Lansdown: The dry plant has been running, was being in operation since May, so we got a little bit of a chance to see how that performs. We are pretty comfortable with the way the major equipments has operated. We've had waste material run through the entire plants, and when we had to look at our major equipment, we were [to-date] we were pretty comfortable with how they were performing. As Richard said, the HPGRs were one of the bigger risk items. We do have Cerro Verde in Peru, which is run with the same flow sheet and the same HPGRs and they have had some pretty good experience there. They ramped up reasonably well. We've also got a good relationship with our (inaudible) and they have set up to support our maintenance needs which is going to be the big ticket item, the big area of focus for us now, specifically set up (inaudible) project, Tom do you want to comment anymore on HPGRs, Tom McCauley our Project Director is with us and (inaudible).
Tom McCauley: I think Guy and Richard summed it up well, but if you can see the dry plant production very well, and the initial stuff that's gone through the mill has come out very well, so, very encouraged by that, as Guy said it’s early days, but going through the plan really well.
Guy Lansdown: We have a very long conveyor system out there, we have been running for sometime. We've had a few issues initially, but we've had plenty of times to fix those up. So having the dry plant running and operational, and really shaken down, I think it has increase the confidence level that we have with respect to the moving into the wet plant we acknowledge it is still in process as we move into ramp up and into commercial production, while we keep ticking away those areas that might have been risks, and with that, hopefully Barry we'll have you down there next year, and you can walk in front of these things, see it producing ore and going all the way to gold production.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: All right. Just a clarification so that I understand, you say you've put material through there, but I would assume that that material that you are putting through is from the upper parts of the ore body, which being oxidized and what not, I wouldn't expect to have anywhere near the hardness of material that will form the bulk of the ore body there. Have you indeed been able to put through some of the harder ore?
Richard O'Brien: That's a real good question, and you are right on it. the existing ore body was oxide material or the (inaudible). We have indeed put hard ways through the plant. We haven't put any of the soft oxide material through and that's the material that we are talking about that is working pretty well. Obviously it was waste material. We don't want to be putting any ore through, but we have got ore on the stockpile already to run through and we're hoping to introduce that shortly.
Barry Cooper - CIBC: So the work index on that would be typical what you would expect for the bulk of the ore body than I guess.
Richard O'Brien: Barry, it's actually a little bit harder. Some of the waste is actually harder than some of the ore, that's why we're actually pretty satisfied with the production.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our next question is from David Haughton from BMO. Your line is open.
David Haughton - BMO: Yes, good morning, and thank you. Richard, you had mentioned in the commentary, and I missed the data, that there is some sort of catch-up payment of AngloGold in relation to Boddington.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I did all that. Russ will talk about that.
Russell Ball: Yes, the transaction took effect January 1. So, as we went to and closed, they were funding their share, which essentially we refunded approximately $200 million. There was some working capital adjustment, but those numbers are included in our capital in the second quarter, that catch-up, and the full cost for the full year at 100%.
Richard O'Brien: We knew going into the year that we weren't exactly sure of the date, but we knew we were going to be responsible for 100% of the capital expenditures for 2009. So, that was worrying our estimates, and what we have done now is with the closing, this is really the payment of that accrued capital.
David Haughton - BMO: So, when I have a look at the CapEx for the first six months at Boddington, it's $684 million, is that letting out the 200 mil that you are expecting back from AngloGold?
Russell Ball: No, that includes Anglo's roughly $200 million on a capital to-date. So, you should think about that as roughly $400 per hour of historic [fees] this year, and then on the 200 round numbers for the [AngloGold] effective January 1.
David Haughton - BMO: All right. So you are getting that money back?
Richard O'Brien: No, actually we're not getting the money back. We're paying them back as our ownership really became effective January 1. As we have been spending capital during the year, they have been paying their share because we weren't sure when the date was going to close. Now we've closed. Now we're paying them back. So, what Russ was saying is 200 in the capital in this quarter actually should be over the full six months if you want to look at how Boddington is ramped up during the year.
David Haughton - BMO: I understand now. And how much is left to be spent for completion of Boddington?
Richard O'Brien: It's probably in the order of $150 million to $200 million.
Guy Lansdown: About $200 million 
Russell Ball: David, this is Russ. Just to be clear, the final capital number will be a function of commercial production, which, as Richard said, we estimate to take place late in the fourth quarter. Commercial production is roughly at 75% of (inaudible). So we've had this question earlier, it's not 100%. So we'll see when that occurs. The longer that date goes, the more operating costs will shift to capital. It's not incremental spend. It's just under the accounting provisions we will be required to capitalize on certain of the mining costs, the G&A and other costs we are incurring after that commercial production date.
David Haughton - BMO: Offset by whatever revenues you gain?
Russell Ball: Correct.
David Haughton - BMO: I also noticed in one of your slides that the Boddington life is extended from 20 years to 24 years. Is that in anticipation of a reserve upgrade?
Richard O'Brien: That's based on our latest reserve estimate which was updated at the end of 2008, early 2009.
David Haughton - BMO: Changing topics for some new development projects that you've highlighted in the commentary, in case of Midas Conga and also Hope Bay, what do you expect to spend in those two projects in 2009?
Richard O'Brien: At Hope Bay, we are looking at spending of the order of $60 million, and at Conga we are looking at the order of $20 million to $30 million.
David Haughton - BMO: Is that total for the year or remaining?
Richard O'Brien: That's for the year. Total for the year.
Russell Ball: For both projects.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, for both projects.
Operator: Our next question is from [Paritosh Mishra] from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Two questions. First at Boddington, would your copper production start up pretty much at the same time as gold production? Second, if you have any updates on any projects related to longer term out for Yanacocha? I know you talked about Conga, but in the last conference call, you mentioned some other projects like sulfides and Quilish deposits. Any update on that will be appreciated. Thank you.
Richard O'Brien:  On the Boddington production, the copper does come out together with the gold and the concentrate that we have produced. There are few production strings. We wanted a [gold door] and the other the copper/gold concentrate. So, they will be produced simultaneously.
Guy Lansdown: With respect to other projects in and around the Yanacocha, we continue to do some drilling around the sulfide projects. That's really related to continuing development of the technical path that would be necessary to process that. So, we continue to spend some money on that and we continue to look at that over a longer term opportunity base. With respect to the Quilish, as we continually said, Quilish is in our NRM, not in our reserve base, and the reason it is because we continue to know that we will have to get a community and government support to be able to bring that in. What I can tell you is that it's an important deposit for us, but not so important that we want to override the local, social, and political environment around Cerro Quilish. So, we hope that it will come overtime, but it will only come with and when we get the right level of social excitement. So I don't want to give you the impression it's out there in the very near term, it's not. Finally, around Conga, we continue to refine the plan for development and there are a number of other companies in the area. We are also looking at similar comparable (inaudible). We are in the process of trying to figure out how we can in effect reduce the level of total infrastructure payments. So that's one of the things we continue to try to optimize with others.
Richard O'Brien:  With that, we appreciate everyone's attention and taking time for us today. Thanks a lot.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-05-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. I'd like remind all participants your line will be on a listen-only mode throughout the presentation. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded. If you do have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Richard O'Brien, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you very much operator. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today to discuss Newmont's Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2009. With me in the room today are several members of our management team. We're also joined by Russell Ball; Guy Lansdown and Brian Hill, who are joining us in... from Nevada, where they are participating in our safety summit. All of those members of management will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our updated website at www.newmont.com. For those of you with access to our simulcast presentation, I'd like to start with some comments on slide three. As we look at the first quarter highlights, I am pleased to report solid operating and financial results, with our ongoing focus on our operational and project execution. Our first quarter performance provides a good foundation for us to deliver on our operating plans for the full year in 2009. As we discussed at our Investor Day in March, we believe our primary driver of long term value for Newmont is cash flow generation. Our first quarter results demonstrate our focus on driving this value. During the quarter, we generated cash flow from continuing operations of $387 million or $0.82 per share. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was 208 million or $0.44 per share, and we reported net income on a GAAP basis of 189 million or $0.40 per share. This compares with GAAP net income of 365 million or $0.81 per share for the first quarter of 2008. This reduction in earnings is primarily driven by lower realized copper prices, which reduced revenue by about 240 million, and slightly lower gold production and lower gold price, which reduced revenues by about 120 million. Our operations delivered equity gold sales of approximately 1.3 million ounces for the quarter at costs applicable to sales of $435 per ounce. Also, during the quarter, we sold 43 million pounds of copper, primarily from our Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia. A critical performance driver for us in 2009 is completing our Boddington project by the middle part of this year and successfully ramping toward commercial production. I'll provide a bit more detail about Boddington later in the presentation. But I am pleased to say we continue to expect start-up in mid 2009. Importantly, we are maintaining our annual equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales outlook for 2009. As we turn to slide four, looking at our equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales by region, we're generally performing in line with our expectations. In Nevada, we sold 518,000 ounces, slightly above expectations, primarily due to higher throughput at Mill 6 and the Sage Autoclave and higher underground production at Leeville, Chukar and Carlin East. These gold sales combined with lower input costs resulted in costs applicable to sales for Nevada of $509 an ounce, somewhat lower than expected. At Yanacocha, changes in mine sequencing during the quarter resulted in gold sales of 241,000 ounces for the quarter, slightly lower than expected. Costs applicable to sales of $324 per ounce at Yanacocha were adversely impacted by a higher than anticipated royalties and production taxes, due to higher gold prices. In Australia, equity gold sales of 293,000 ounces were also above expectations due to higher grades and recoveries at Jundee and Kalgoorlie. Higher sales and favorable Australian dollar exchange rates during the first quarter generated costs applicable to sales of $492 per ounce, again below expectations. Of note, our higher than expected costs applicable to sales of $551 per ounce in the other category, which includes La Herradura in Mexico and Kori Kollo in Bolivia. This increase is primarily due to leach pad and inventory write-downs at Kori Kollo during the first quarter. As we stated earlier, our operating performance for 2009 is skewed to the last six months of the year, as a function of the ramp up of Boddington, mine sequencing at Yanacocha, no shut downs in Nevada for planned maintenance activities during the second quarter of the year and the traditional production benefits from the dry season at Batu Hijau, which we see in the third and fourth quarters of the year. We're expecting our financial results for the second quarter to be negatively impacted by some one-time transactions, including stamp duties of approximately $60 million associated with the closing of the Boddington acquisition. Again, I would like to reiterate that while we've recognized the quarterly fluctuations will occur, we continue to drive our business toward meeting and exceeding our annual targets. As it was in 2008, continuing to meet or exceed our annual outlook for 2009 is still job number one here at Newmont. Turning to slide five for the gold industry as a whole, gold grades continue to decline. Since 2003, grades have decreased by approximately 27%. As operations mature, gold producers, including Newmont, are forced to extract ores with lower grades that are often accompanied by higher separations. In addition, our costs were impacted by market fluctuations. The graph on the right hand side of this slide demonstrates our updated costs applicable to sales for 2009. In comparison with our original expectations, our costs will be adversely impacted by higher anticipated gold prices due to higher royalties and taxes that will peg to gold prices. And cost increases to our original outlook are being offset by lower than anticipated Australian dollar foreign exchange rates and oil prices. We're, therefore, maintaining our costs applicable to sales with our original outlook that we shared earlier this year. It is still early in the year, and we're continuing to see lots of fluctuation in input costs. Slide six demonstrates our ability to deliver leverage to gold prices. The graph on the right hand side of the page displays what our costs applicable to sales would have been, if we were able to use our copper revenues at Batu Hijau and our cash distributions from our investment in the Canadian Oil Sands Trust, as a credit to our costs. For the quarter, we reported costs applicable to sales of $435 per ounce. As illustrated in the chart, our costs applicable to sales would have been $383 per ounce, net is a $52 per ounce credits from copper revenues and a $4 million that we received from Canadian Oil Sands Trust distributions during the quarter. While our actual costs applicable to sales of $435 per ounce were lower than our internal expectations for the first quarter, they may appear somewhat higher than expected by external stakeholders due to lower input costs realized during the quarter. This warrants some commentary. As previously discussed, higher expected gold sales in the second half of the year will drive our costs applicable to sales down closer to the mid-point of our annual outlook. And our cost and production guidance again is annual, not quarterly. In addition, there is a lag effect with input cost reductions being realized in our numbers. We generally see a one to two quarter delay as we work through our inventories and stockpiles. We continue to work with our vendors to ensure our input commodity costs closely reflect the current costs and labor environments. And finally, as you would expect, higher realized gold prices over the quarter negatively impact our costs as royalties and production taxes increase. We'll take that high class piece of the increase any time. With, despite of variability in input cost, primarily oil prices and Australian dollar exchange rates and with Boddington starting up in the second half of the year, we've positioned ourselves to realize significant margin expansion, if gold prices continue to remain strong. As shown on slide seven, during 2009 we remain committed to delivering on our plans in a safe and environmentally sound manner and to doing what we say we're going to do. This is the cornerstone of our business and as mentioned previously, should allow us to deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. During the second quarter, we continue to focus on transitioning our Boddington project operations. Happy to report that we're on schedule for this critical deliverable. Another key deliverable for us in 2009 is to work with the government of Indonesia to fulfill our commitments in regard to the recently announced arbitration panel's decision regarding the Batu Hijau divestiture process. But those who attended or listened to our Investor Day in March, we outlined our disciplined approach to evaluating the investment opportunities. Under this approach, we'll continue to actively evaluate and pursue the best available internal and external investment opportunities to sustain our business, with an ongoing focus on Conga in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada, and Akyem in Ghana. Finally, during 2009 we are enhancing our focus on improving operational and business efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of delivering superior leverage to gold prices and improving our financial returns. The current status of our internal project pipeline is displayed on slide eight. During our Investor Day, last month we went through the majority of the projects. So, instead of project specific, we'll highlight our North America and Africa regions. Within North America, we're advancing multiple projects, both large and small with low geopolitical risk. Our total expense advance project and exploration spending in the region is about $110 million, which includes over 200 kilometers of drilling split equally between major opportunities and multiple smaller near term opportunities. Major programs within North America include 60 million directed towards our exploration focused Hope Bay program and multiple near mine opportunities, for short-term resource additions and production, including Gold Quarry West Wall and Turf. In Africa, we're also advancing multiple opportunities and evaluating new near mine exploration results to optimize this region. We have positive drill results under the Subika pit Ahafo operations. We're evaluating opportunities there for both open pit and underground expansion. We're also evaluating the team given the recent receipt of the environment impact assessment permit, coupled with more favorable project development conditions in the current market. We should see results from these efforts as the year progresses. As shown on slide 9, Boddington capital and start-up estimates remain on schedule. Currently, overall progress is approximately 95% complete. Pre-commissioning work has been initiated in the wet plant with the first environmental motors completing test runs last week. We will complete further pre-commissioning of the wet plant over the coming weeks. From a safety perspective, Boddington is still a benchmark project in Australia. The project just received Akersolutions 2008 P&C Just Care Award for overall health and safety and environmental performance. Safety is still very much our focus going forward, especially as we're moving into commissioning phase. However, we have the people and systems; we will continue to make safety our first priority. Slide 10 provides a current photo of the processing facilities at Boddington. Although this photo still does not do this project justice, it does provide a view of the size and scale of the project. I'll highlight a few areas for your reference. The dry plant is shown on the right side of the photo. Construction work in this area is approximately 99% complete. Our EPCM contract has officially turned over to our operations team, the primary crusher, conveyor and of course all feeders, and is currently in the process of turning over the high pressure grinding rolls. The wet plant which includes the majority of the remaining facilities in the photo includes two separate trains. Mechanical equipment associated with the first train is currently in the punch list phase with some remaining piping to be installed. The second train will follow in the coming months as planned in our stage turnover and ramp up of the overall plant. Pre-commissioning work on the mill (ph) conveyors and screening systems has been completed. Motors associated with the first mill have completed test runs and several water tests have also been completed. Overall, as you can see from photo the project is in the final stations of completion. I continue to be impressed by the dedication and caliber of our employees at Boddington and from around the globe including the team from Phoenix and Nevada, who are all committed to the successful transition of this project into operations. Turning to slide 11, as most of you know the arbitration panel ruled on the divestiture issue on March 31. Importantly, the panel ruled that the contract of work remains in full effect. As we have always maintained, we're committed to honoring the sale down provisions defined in the contract of work. The arbitration ruling provided clarification, of to whom we should sell. The panel also directed its pledges to the senior lenders must be removed before qualifying offers can be made. Newmont and our partner, Sumitomo are committed to complying with this requirement. In fact earlier this week, we received confirmation from the senior lenders, the pledges on the 31% of PTNNT shares subject to the divestiture requirements will be removed. Pending approval of the necessary changes to our PTNNT project financing facility by our partner, Sumitomo, this confirmation will allow us to transfer the required shares if any obligations within the 180 cure period provided by the arbitration panel. Starting with slide 12, the next few slides demonstrate some of the competing tensions that we believe are currently driving the gold market and consequently influencing our share price. Once -- since last fall, we have seen a decoupling of the traditional relationship between a weaker U.S. dollar and stronger gold prices. We believe that this has been driven by a continuing flight to quality, as investors seek the safety of gold and gold stocks. U.S. dollar strength is benefiting from deflationary pressures resulting from below potential economic growth, distressed credit markets and massive retrenchment of energy prices. We do expect gold prices in the U.S. dollar to re-couple in the near future as fiscal and monetary policies began to work, the sign that the credit markets are lifting consumer confidence. As this occurs, we expect inflation risk to return with U.S. dollar weakening and the lifting of gold prices. As shown on the chart on the right hand side of the slide, the Federal Reserve has injected over $1 trillion in liquidity into the U.S. financial system by expanding the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed proves flowing with China's liquidity. Once an economic recovery is underway or cannot due to political pressures, this has potential to send inflation toward 1970 levels and beyond. Turning to slide 13. As demonstrated by increasing the ETF demand for gold, investors are continuing to flock to gold in light of the uncertainties in global financial systems and currencies. Gold is still viewed as the safe-haven investment. In addition, we believe that many central banks around the world may be more likely to acquire gold at this point due to their over exposure to the U.S. dollar, principally China and the oil exporting countries. In fact last week, China revealed that it is over 1000 tons of gold in reserves, much higher amount than previously estimated. In dollar terms, jewelry demand is in an all time high. However, physical demand remains under pressure as the direct result of reduced global discretionary spending, especially in many jewelry demanding countries. For example, during the last twelve months the Indian Rupiya (sic)[Rupee] has lost 25% of its value against the dollar, thus adversely impacting jewelry demand in that country. This situation should reverse with any U.S. dollar weakness. To summarize our view on gold market conditions, pending U.S. dollar weakness coupled with industry supply and demand fundamentals provide for significant upside in gold prices and our stock. The key for our management team and employees is to manage our business with a focus that allows for cash flow generation, margin expansion and higher returns on invested capital as gold prices increase, thus providing long-term value to our shareholders. In closing, slide 14 provides a longer-term vision for Newmont and a summary of our strategic direction to deliver value to our stakeholders. We recognize we are in a long-term industry and we'll operate our business accordingly. As such, it is important to have a vision for where we want to be over the next five years. We'll continue to develop better operating plans with longer-term delivery horizons. One success criteria we have established for the company, and upon which every Newmont employee will be evaluated is three-year accountability. Variability within the quarters is still expected but we plan on a longer-term basis to deliver sustainable, operating performance and hold ourselves accountable to these metrics. We are developing and further refining robust analytics to assure that we are investing our limited capital into the highest ranking opportunities that enhance the strategic direction of our company. These opportunities may be from exploration, project development and/or acquisitions. Operating our business with focused discipline is at the heart of our company. We're pleased with our operating performance during the first quarter. However, we remain focused on the work we have to do during 2009 and beyond to deliver long-term value. And with that I'll turn it back to the operator and thank you for listening and open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Victor Flores. Sir, you may ask your question.
Victor Flores: Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. First, if I could begin with the team. I realize that not a lot of time has passed since the Investor Day, but I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what new information you've assessed in that past month or so that would lead you to be more or less encouraged with respect to the potential of the delivery team?
Richard O'Brien: I am going to turn that over to Guy Lansdown. Guy, do you want to take that one?
Guy Lansdown: Yeah, I can do that. Thanks, Richard and thanks Victor. Victor, we haven't learned much more since we talked at the Analyst Day, but we are working very hard with the team to look at both achievements to be here. We're looking at what realistic capital cost estimates and operating cost estimates are in this current market environment. And we'll continue to do that over the course of the next several months. So, we'll partly answer, but at this point in time, we haven't run much more than what we told you during Analyst Day.
Victor Flores: Okay, great, thank you. Second question goes to a comment made in the introductory remarks about the $60 million stamp duty on the purchase of Boddington coming through the income statement in Q2 '09. I think the comment was made that there were other items. So could you tell us what those items are, if they're material?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, I am going turn that over to Roger Johnson, our Vice President and Controller.
Victor Flores: Thanks.
Roger Johnson: Thank you, Richard. Victor, the main items that will be coming through other stand, so there will be some other transaction costs associated with Boddington, the normal expectation in our legal fees and advisor fees coming through. And as you probably are aware, these are result of the changes in the business combination accounting rules in the U.S. that previously these costs would have been capitalized, but the new rules require us to charge them to the earnings statement.
Victor Flores: Okay. That's fine. And is there an order of magnitude on those transaction costs?
Roger Johnson: I think you can use the 60 million to 65 million as a owned encompassing number.
Victor Flores: Okay. So that would be more or less the total amount ?
Roger Johnson: Yes sir.
Richard O'Brien: Yes.
Victor Flores: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Victor.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from David Haughton. Sir you may begin.
David Haughton: Good morning and thank you. I've got a few questions. Firstly, at Yanacocha, the great going through the mill was pretty healthy looking. And I am wondering what sort of outlook you have for that, especially when it's combined with the previous statement that you made that you expect Yanacocha to be backend loaded on grade.
Richard O'Brien: Sure, Brian Hill, do you want to answer that one?
Brian Hill: Sure, thanks David. In Yanacocha, it's really a function of we're into some higher grades in the pits than we had predicted or expected coming through from the model. So that's performing quite well. The backend loading that we have not really related to grade, it's more related to ounce flow coming out of the pad. We're heavier in the front end of this year in terms of pad loading. So we're actually seeing more ounces come out in the second half of the year than the first half.
David Haughton: All right.
Richard O'Brien: And then David, just to finish up on that, I would say that the gold mill continues to operate at or above capacity and with head grades, which are at or above what we'd planned on. So everything's going pretty well with respect to the gold mill.
David Haughton: Thank you. And also through the gold mill, you'd be recovering silver. It's not mentioned in the report. What sort of grade are we looking at for the silver and your recoveries?
Richard O'Brien: Brian, do you have that, I don't.
Brian Hill: I don't have that right off the top of my head. I knew that from Analyst Day, we were sort of within that 85 to 90% range, I believe. And we're also in silver recoveries in that range.
Richard O'Brien: We can get back to you with more info on that David.
Unidentified Analyst: David I'll follow-up with you on that. I mean I guess the important thing is that we're getting much higher recoveries on the silver, the grade is probably the same as it was obviously going on our leach pad. I'll get back to you with a number on that.
David Haughton: And I'll take it that silver production's acting as a credit for your cash balances.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, that's correct, that's correct.
David Haughton: Okay. Also in your 10-Q, I noticed that you had a small acquisition, nearby property at La Herradura. Can you explain what that entails? And also the amount of holding stack was higher than what we've seen previously? I'm wondering if you can give us an outlook.
Richard O'Brien: I am going to ask David Faley, our Vice President of Development to take a look at that.
David Faley: Sure, thanks. We acquired with our partner Brass Mills (ph), Yanacocha property which is on strike with La Herradura. It's a development opportunity and has exploration potential. And so it's within the joint venture property itself.
David Haughton: And the increased stacking right that we saw during the quarter. Can we expect that going forward?
Richard O'Brien: I don't think we have, we don't have any answer to that. When David, we'll comeback to you at that one.
David Haughton: All right. Well, thank you very much guys.
Richard O'Brien: You're welcome.
Operator: Okay. Our next question comes from Barry Cooper. You may ask your question.
Barry Cooper: Yeah, good morning everyone. Just wondering if you can walk me through what you anticipate to be kind of first the steps for Batu Hijau. I know that there have been some prior agreements on valuation. And I'm just wondering how those valuations hold in the current market. Obviously, copper changed, and gold prices changed. Are you stuck with those prior valuations? Or you're going to get the benefit of those prior valuations? Or just how is this thing going to hold and fall over the next 180 days?
Richard O'Brien: Let me give a little a little bit on the unfolding. And then I'll Russell to jump in on the valuation. But basically as a result of the arbitration order in addition to confirming that the contract of work is still in force, the arbitration panel did say that the Newmont, think of it this way, pretty much needs to sell to whomever the government tells us to sell to. And before we had tried to move into the business, the business phase, instead of the business, the government phase, because we've had certain periods that are expired under the contract. The panel said none of that applies. You will just sell to whoever the government wants you to sell to. And you will do it with shares that don't have any leans or pledges against them. So as I mentioned, we are in the process of removing the pledges. We will then re-offer the shares to the government. The anticipation is that the ruling from the panel we believe, suggests that the 2006 and 2007 prices are still what they were when we offer them and because we did not complete 2008 offer in the way that the panel and the government had anticipated. And we've not completed 2009 pricing. Those are probably still out for discussion. As a consequence to that, I would say that we're still in the process of confirming with the government, the right way forward in terms of valuation, but Russ, do you want to add some of that?
Russell Ball: Yeah, thanks Richard. Barry, yeah, you have to break it into '06 and '07 which we believe the price has been agreed. The tribunal panel never ruled on that specific issue, and we're working through discussions of the Indonesian government to clarify that. But we believe the '06 and '07 price was set. As Richard said '08 to '09, given that we filed for arbitration in March last year we never actually agreed those prices with the government. So, we have a team that has begun discussions around valuation. And just to go back and refresh, remember the '06 valuation was 3.6 billion, went up to 4. It went up to 6.1 and then our most recent is around 4.9 billion. So, to your point earlier, yes we have reflected lower commodity prices, certainly in the short-term in those valuations. And that's why you see the decrease from 6.1 to 4.9. And we also have a lower valuation in that. It will be a long project which is deposit of 60 kilometers to the east. So those will be items that get discussed. And we have started that process. We have a team, the government appointed a team. And we're going to through '08 and '09, with them, hopefully the next month or so.
Barry Cooper: Hypothetically, if somebody came up with the cash, as an example, for purchasing these. And it's hard for me to describe them, how that would happen. But would you have to go back and then repay them an awful lot of the profits that you would have generated over the past couple of years? And indeed if you would have been hedged in some of those years for the copper, would you conceivably have to wind up paying for unhedged copper production that would have occurred during those prior years?
Richard O'Brien: No. Larry?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Barry, yeah, Richard is correct, no. We believe and this issue was addressed in some point in a claim for damages that was a part of the contract of work. And the panel ruled clearly that in addition to the contract of work not being canceled that damages were not entitled, so we believe that any transfer would then apply on a prospective basis to future earnings.
Barry Cooper: Right. Okay. And then another and separate question, you've had Hope Bay now for a year and half or so and you spent a fair bit for it. And I think probably more than 100 million since you got it, we've had virtually no news. When do you think we are going to get some sort of information flow from that asset?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, actually we did have a brief update at the Analyst Day, where we talked about what the progress going forward was for this year, but Guy, do you want to recapture that because there we don't have a lot to add in addition to that, but Guy, do you want to bring that up?
Guy Lansdown: Yes, I can do that sure Richard. Barry, as you've correctly said, we've invested a fair amount of money setting up sort of the infrastructure wise, so that we got a good platform from which we can work safely to continue exploration and development activities in the area. That was bulk of that effort last year. This year, we have a multi-pronged approach, where we are aggressively going after our exploration activities both on the generative side, where we're looking at the targets across the whole region, the whole 80 kilometers strike length, or belt length. And we'll continue to define the answers or the potential around the existing resources. In addition to that what we got going on is our team that we also built last year is busy looking at many options to develop the projects, looking for the optimal way to develop it. And so, through the course of the year, we'll a lot more, and we would continue to update or provide update as meaningful information becomes available.
Barry Cooper: And any kind of changes to the prior resource numbers or anything in terms of what you found so far? Are you substantiating the numbers or better or worse or any comment that you can make on that?
Richard O'Brien: Well, I'd say we're busy going through the process of confirming them. Going through the process of looking at the data, we will know more once we've drilled more, and too early to really say meaningfully whether we've got anything to report on this stage.
Barry Cooper: Okay. I guess we'll look patiently for a while longer then.
Richard O'Brien: Yes. Thanks Barry.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Thanks Barry.
Operator: Okay. (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Kaushik Mitra. Sir, you may ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two questions; first, is there any provisional pricing adjustment term in your copper sales and how that might change in 2Q if copper stays above $2? And the second, you've mentioned briefly about the power situation in Ghana has improved. Could you talk about that little bit more? Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: I'll take the power one and then I will ask Roger Johnson to talk about the provisional pricing one. So on power, the improvement that we are talking about is, there is more hydro than perhaps we had expected in our -- when we set our guidance for the year. And hydro power versus diesel power for us results in lower costs applicable to sales, so that's really the reference. In terms of the going forward, the government -- new government in Ghana is reviewing energy infrastructure, but what I'd say is these are really temporary reductions in power costs because of increased hydro availability, it doesn't reflect for instance the new building of a substantial power station in Ghana. So that's probably still to come. Roger, you want to talk about provisional pricing?
Roger Johnson: Yeah, thanks Richard. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately &#8356;86 million of copper provisionally priced at $1.83. So, we will have a significant amount that will be priced in the second quarter. Just to call your attention to the fact that we hit a similar favorable variance coming in the first quarter, there was about a $29 million favorable impact from the provisional pricing that was at the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Bridges. You may ask your question sir.
John Bridges: Good morning, Brian and everybody. Just wondering if you could square circle. Reading one of Ventura's report last night, they were making the points that, the production at Yanacocha was similar to Q1 '08. But the difference was the build up of inventory and just the sales reduction. That's a bit different to what you're saying. Could you explain where we're going wrong here?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, let me just try square that circle. As you say, we're actually comparing to expectations, not to the prior year quarter. I think their description of the prior year quarter is actually correct. We're just comparing it to where we thought we were going to be for the quarter.
John Bridges: Okay. So, is there any build up in inventory? Or was there a build up in the leach pads?
Roger Johnson: This is Roger Johnson. There is a slight build in the inventory at Yanacocha. So one of Ventura's representation, we agree with.
John Bridges: Okay and then maybe one for Brian. You, at the investor presentation, were talking about how you're able at the comfort of surveying the scene and figuring out whether you're going to go ahead with your projects, your resource projects or maybe be in the position to buy something. I just wondered from a couple of months on, any changes, any enhancements?
Brian Hill: I think John, there are some processes we're still working our way through in terms of having a look at, at how we rate and rank both our smaller internal projects and some of the ones which Guy has spoken about. And that sort of coupled with, with some of the works that Randy's doing in terms of looking at other strategic opportunities. So that's still a work in progress, as far as we're concerned.
John Bridges: Okay. That's understandable. Any -- have you given yourself any deadline as to when to come to conclusions on that?
Brian Hill: No, not really. That's just going to be an ongoing process that we're just discontinuing to look at them, and advance them as best we can.
John Bridges: Okay. Great. Congratulations on the quarter guys. Good luck.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks John.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And our next question comes from Patrick Chidley. Sir you may ask your question.
Patrick Chidley: Thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about particularly sort of the long-term outlook you have for Yanacocha, being as the reserve life, I don't think to be that long anymore. And whether or not -- what sort of timing we might expect on Minas Conga in terms of the development decision in the light of some of these -- indicating some of the Chinese companies in the district or --
Richard O'Brien: Couple of things, Patrick. First, the Conga decision is one that as Guy referenced on a team. We're seeing some reduction in capital cost estimates. We're still pushing that project through our pipeline and we'll continue to evaluate that one. There are some other things going on in that district. And so it's something that we're looking at as well. In addition to that, at Yanacocha, we mentioned this again at Investor Day, but we do have several projects going to continue to push the life of Yanacocha out. In particular, we're drilling the Sulfides underneath the pits, examining additional ways to process those Sulfides economically. And if that can be done, there will be a much longer life at Yanacocha. We also have the potential over time to take back from our NRM and put into reserves the Cu Leach deposit, which is going to take quite a bit of work and some social discussions that we need to have to bring that back into reserves. All in all, we continue to look at Yanacocha, which is clearly in the back half of the slides. And if we're able to put the Sulfides and Cu Leach in, we clearly have the ways to run. If we're not, I'd suggest by the mid-teens we're going to see a pretty good decline at Yanacocha.
Patrick Chidley: Does Sulfides -- they are not in your reserve at the moment and they are not in your -- are they in your mineralized material or not?
Richard O'Brien: They are not in any, I think at this point as we continue to find ways to economically process those, and as I said, really defining the reserve base there.
Patrick Chidley: Is there a geological resource on those Sulfides that through the years of drilling -- I know you've been drilling that for a long time in those Sulfides. Any sort of estimates?
Richard O'Brien: I'm sorry I missed the last word, any?
Patrick Chidley: Any estimate?
Richard O'Brien: No, that's precisely what we're doing at this point. We have not put a resource up, we're continuing to explore and investigate.
Patrick Chidley: Yeah.
Richard O'Brien: Very early stages.
Patrick Chidley: Okay. Good work. Thanks very much then.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you. So, thank you all for attending today. We appreciate your questions and your attention and we look forward to talking to you again in July. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by for Newmont Mining Corporation Q4 2008 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO.
Richard T. O'Brien: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today to discuss Newmont's financial results for 2008. With me in the room today are several members of management team who will also be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, as we always do, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings. Turning to slide three, for those of you with access to our simulcast presentation, when I became CEO of Newmont in July 2007, we committed ourselves to reestablishing Newmont's credibility by delivering results inline with our plans and market expectations, with a focus on operational and project planning and execution. For our management team we embrace the need for a new day dawning at Newmont. As we turn our attention to 2009 and beyond we believe that the day has done for our company as we shift our focus to building on the momentum we've established over the last 18 months. And you can see that illustrated on the top half of our corporate score card on this side. We also remain focused on the bottom half of this score card highlighting the key items that we still need to work on and execute. As shown on this slide, we focused our efforts in 2008 on establishing safe and environmentally sound operating performance within expectations, highlighted by delivering on our original plans for gold sales, cost applicable to sales, and the capital expenditures. And early this year we improved our production and operating cost profile with the acquisition of the remaining 33% of Boddington from Anglo Gold. We're excited about this project and our ability to consolidate this world class asset. I'll speak more specifically about these transactions later in the presentation. At the same time we made the Boddington acquisition we capitalized on the opportunity to increase our financial flexibility with $1.7 billion issuance from stock and convertible debt. We're grateful to our investors for their confidence in our strategic direction. And acknowledge that we must provide disciplined stewardship for the capital the market has provided us. In 2009 we remain committed to delivering on our operating plans and to doing what we say we're going to do. This is a corner stone of how we operate our business. In addition during the first half of this year we'll focus on completing Boddington which remains on schedule for a mid 2009 startup. We'll also continue to work to resolve the Batu Hijau divestiture issues. Arbitration panel deliberations are continuing and we expect the decision in the first half of 2009. As we have said all along Newmont remains committed to our divestiture obligations as outlined in the contract to work. We'll continue to keep you informed as the arbitration process unfolds. Throughout 2009 we will also continue to actively evaluate and pursue the best available internal and external investment opportunities to sustain and grow our business. Internally we're continuing work on Conga in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada, and Akyem in Ghana and externally we'll continue to look for opportunistic accretive acquisitions. Finally, during 2009 we'll redouble our focus on improving operational and business efficiencies throughout the organization through our one Newmont initiative with the goal of increasing efficiencies, reducing costs, delivering superior leverage to gold prices, and enhancing our financial returns. As the next slide 4 shows our 2008 highlights, we reported solid operating and financial results. During the year we sold approximately 5.2 million equity ounces of gold at cost applicable to sales of $440 per ounce. Capital expenditures for 2008 were approximately 1.9 billion, primarily related to Boddington which was about 825 million, Hope Bay where we spent about 82 million for the camp, road, and airstrip, completion of the Nevada power plant at about 40 million and completion of Yanacocha gold mill at about 40 million. With our focus on continued operational and project execution we were able to meet our original outlook for equity gold sales, cost applicable to sales, and capital expenditures for the year. Turning to the next slide our increase in gold margin in 2008 demonstrates our increasing leverage for the gold price. Over the year we realized an approximate 40% increase in gold operating margin despite challenging and volatile industry wide cost pressures. As mentioned earlier, we continue to pursue business and operating efficiencies across our portfolio as we strive for ongoing margin expansion. Our adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $0.26 on operating performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjustments to net income include the previously announced approximately $140 million write-down of felk (ph) and our marketable securities. In addition, during the quarter we incurred a negative mark-to-market of approximately $90 million related to provisional copper sales or about $0.05 after tax. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was 905 million, for the year was approximately 905 million or a $1.99 per share. This represents a 50% increase from the prior year of 600 million or $1.33 per share. On a GAAP basis we reported net income for 2009 of 853 million or $1.88 per share. These results were adversely impacted by a pre tax write down of marketable securities and other assets of about $235 million for the year. Shifting now to our reserve base illustrated on slide 6, including the Boddingtons acquisition announced earlier this year, our equity pro forma reserves net of depletion increased approximately 6% over the prior year. With the addition of 6.6 million ounce bringing our pro forma reserves to approximately 92 million ounces on January 1, 2009. We also increased our non reserve material by approximately 40% from the prior year. As you'll note on this slide 60% of our reserves are anchored in geopolitically stable Australia, North America. As I had mentioned on previous earnings calls during my tenure as CEO, I'm committed to refocusing this company, providing a solid foundation and creating future growth opportunities. Turning to slide 7, as we mentioned on our third quarter 2008 earnings call, due to continued turmoil in the commodity and financial markets, we revaluated our 2009 business plans to conserve our short-term cash flow and preserve our long-term growth options. Notwithstanding that focus as you can see on this slide, we anticipate increased equity gold sales at lower cost and with lower capital. So we anticipate an increase in our 2009 equity gold sales primarily as a result of the start up of Boddington accelerating Phase V mining at Batu Hijau and the full year of operation at the gold mill at Yanacocha. The start up at Boddington and increased production of Batu Hijau are also expected to reduce cost applicable to sales in 2009 partially offset by higher cost in Nevada. With the completion of the Nevada power plant and the Yanacocha gold mill in 2008 as well as the declining spend for Boddington in 2009, we anticipate lower capital expenditures of between 1.4 billion and 1.6 billion for the year. Looking at our regional expectations on slide 8 for 2009 we expect higher gold sales as well as lower cost applicable to sales in Australia, Yanacocha, and Batu Hijau somewhat offset by lower expected equity gold sales and higher cost in Nevada. Focusing first on Nevada, equity gold sales are expected to decrease to between 1.8 million and 2 million ounces from 2.2 million ounces in 2008, primarily due to lower grades, fewer oxide leach pad additions and lower recoveries at Mill 6. Cost applicable to sales in Nevada are expected to increase to between 535 and 575 per ounce from $460 per ounce in 2008. This increase is primarily due to reduced gold sales and lower byproduct credits from Phoenix copper sales as a result of lower copper prices. Partially offset by lower diesel cost and a full year of operations in the Nevada power plant. Equity gold sales in Yanacocha are expected to increase to between 975,000 and 1,025,000 ounces from 946,000 ounces in 2008, primarily due to gold mine -- to the gold mill being operational for the entire year. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease to between $290 and $310 per ounce from $346 per ounce in 2008, primarily due to increased gold sales, lower assumed diesel cost, and increased sober byproduct credits. In Australia, equity gold sales are expected to increase to between 1.5 million and 1.6 million ounces from 1.2 million in 2008, primarily due to the start up of the Boddington project in mid 2009 and the acquisition of the remaining 33% interest from Anglo. Boddington should add between 375,000 and 450,000 ounces in 2009. Costs applicable to sales for the region are expected to decrease to between $440 and $480 per ounce from $552 per ounce in 2008, primarily driven by the start up of Boddington, lower cost at Kalgoorlie, and lower diesel cost in Australian dollar assumptions. At Batu Hijau, equity gold sales are expected to increase to between $225 and $250 an ounce, up from 135,000 ounces in 2008. The increase is primarily due to mine sequencing as the mine shifts into the higher grade phase by order in 2009 and because mining in 2008 was constrained due to the abnormally higher rainfall that occurred in the first quarter. Costs applicable to sales are expected to decrease to between $240 and $260 per ounce, down from $414 per ounce in 2008, primarily driven by higher expected sales and lower waste removable cost. Equity gold sales at Ahafo were expected to remain stable to between 500,000 and 525,000 ounces in 2009. Costs applicable to sales are expected to increase to between $450 and $475 per ounce from $408 per ounce in 2008, primarily a result of higher labor cost, a lower benefit from the capitalization of waste removable used in the construction of assets, and a higher fuel price assumption. Slide nine shows -- highlights our capital spending outlook for 2009. In Nevada, capital expenditures are expected to decrease to between 230 million and 260 million with spending focused primarily on sustaining capital investments. In South America, capital expenditures are expected to decrease to approximately 180 million to 200 million with spending primarily focused on sustaining capital investments, the Hiawassee bypass road, and water treatment facilities. In Australia capital expenditures are expected to decrease slightly to 875 million to 925 million, with about 750 million of that spending attributed to the remaining development cost of Boddington. The company continues to expect Boddington to start-up in mid 2009, with total capital expenditures of between 2.6 billion to 2.9 billion. Our Batu Hijau capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to decrease to between 45 million to 55 million with spending focused primarily on sustaining capital. In Ghana capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 80 million to 90 million, primarily related to sustaining capital investments as well as continued development cost to achieve. Slide 10 illustrates our project pipeline and where each project currently fits within our stage gate frame work. I won't go into detail on each of these but I do want to emphasize that this pipeline with its mix of both large and small scale development opportunities gives us a good portfolio of development opportunities that we can pursue and provide value. At the same time, it does give us significant flexibility which we've taken advantage of in 2009 to manage our liquidity, maintain our financial strength by selectively advancing our best available projects, and maintained options. As we've discussed before, all of our investment opportunities both internal and external benefit from our capital effectiveness process, ensuring disciplined capital spending and overtime higher returns on investments from our portfolio of assets. Turning to slide 11, we have recognized that replacement is imperative for Newmont's future. In this challenging commodity and financial market environment, we chose to delay certain Stage Gate decisions in late 2008 in order to conserve our capital while preserving our options for development. For our Congo project in Peru, we are now concentrating our efforts on development and cost optimization with the Stage Gate 3 decision expected in fourth quarter of this year. We're already seeing some potential for capital cost reductions as the market for EPCM contractors, construction related materials, labor and operating costs have cooled off from mid 2008. Regarding our Hope Bay project in Canada, in 2008 as you know we focused our efforts on establishing a safe camp and improving the infrastructure. In 2009 we're advancing an exploration campaign with the Stage Gate 2 decision expected early next year 2010. At Akyem in Ghana, we've been working steadily over the past year with the Ghana EPA, the Minerals Commission, and the Ministry to finalize the necessary permits and lease. The EPA has now granted our permit and we continue to work with the Minister of Mines to finalize the mining lease. As we've discussed with Canadian officials and as we've mentioned to you previously, we've deferred our Stage Gate 2 decision on Akyem while we work with them towards resolution of our long-term cost competitive power solutions. We'll continue to optimize the mine plan this year as we prepare for the Stage Gate review. And again, if we move in the existing more favorable construction environment, we should expect cost to be reduced from our prior estimates. In Nevada, the Gold Quarry West Wall layback project is currently expected to add up to six years to the mine life of gold quarries. We anticipate reserve conversions during 2009 with the Stage Gate 3 decision in the latter part of the year. Also in Nevada, our Turf project, we're really going through a further resource definition and that's planned for this year and that project is progressing through our Stage Gate process. Both of those projects are part of our Nevada growth initiative. Turning to our acquisition of the remaining 33% interest in Boddington, we've announced that earlier this year, projected mine life of over 20 years, a transaction which is consistent with our strategic focus on enhancing our production profile with long life, low cost assets. We expect costs applicable to sales will be approximately $300 per ounce and that of copper byproduct credits over the first five years of operation. This will put Boddington in the lowest quartile the gold pass curve for the industry. This acquisition adds 6.6 million ounces to reserves, will contribute approximately 330,000 ounces of gold production during the first full five years of production. In closing, our company continues to operate under extremely difficult economic conditions, the commodity price volatility and uncertainty, mass portfolio liquidation, global inflation, and limited if any access to capital. As I said previously though, it's an ill wind that doesn't blow somebody some good and I believe that Newmont is in a position to get some good out of this. We're well positioned to respond to this market uncertainty with a strong liquid balance sheet as a result of our recent equity and convertible debt offering. We still maintain a strong investment grade rating. We have an attractive project pipeline that rests within a disciplined Stage Gate framework. And as you can see in 2009, that framework allows us maximum flexibility in the preservation of optionality with respect of the timing of the development of our next major project. As with our Boddington acquisition, we'll continue to evaluate the acquisition landscape to be opportunistic if and when an accretive acquisition arises that adds value for our shareholders. We delivered operating performance consistent with expectations during 2008. We know and we will continue to know the job number one is that we do that again in 2009 and beyond. We acknowledged that we still have a great deal of work to do to achieve our goals. Operating our business with focused discipline is at the heart of our company. During 2009, we'll continue our diligent efforts to drive business and operational efficiencies through standardization, continuous improvement, and strategic alignment across our global portfolio. And with that, I want to thank you for listening today and open it up for any questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from John Bridges from JP Morgan.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Hi there everybody. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more clarification on where you are going with Conga and how you see that transition from the oxidized to the sulfides there?
Richard O'Brien: Sure, with respect to our 2009 development plans, a couple of things are going on at Conga and Yanacocha. At Conga as I mentioned, we continued to optimize the project cost as we look at the go forward economics. We continue to look at working in the regions with others to try to define the infrastructure necessary to support several mines in the region. With respect to the sulfide, in 2009 we continue definitional drilling under the existing pits at Yanacocha and around the existing pits to better define the prospects that we have for development there. We continue to think that there is development opportunity there, we need to do some more drilling this year and next before we can put the economics together to fully justify the investment in that kind of project. So, we are active on both of those John and we'll continue to keep you informed as we get further results.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Yes, I got the impression that it was something that would toss up at one some stage, whether you went to Conga, whether you went deep or at Yanacocha?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, I think its fair to say, probably not toss up, but it is really how do we optimize the two projects at the same time. Yanacocha obviously continues to have an asset life which will be concurrent with Conga. So one of the things that we're really trying to imagine is the best way to develop both projects, deliver the best return over the entire Yanacocha district. And it is a big district, we do have to manage social expectations within the district, and I think the pace that we go at with respect to exploration drilling and development will be somewhat dependent on our expectations for the amount of capital that we will need to spend on both projects.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Is there any hope for new technology to produce metal from sulfides at the mine site rather than shipping everything up?
Richard O'Brien: John, it is all we hope. The realization of hope to opportunity is actually something that we're focused on this year and beyond. Part of what we've done in the last part of 2009 -- 2008 rather is really to reorganize the front end of our business under Guy Lansdown and Guy has put forth an effort towards reestablishing innovation as an important part of what we do at Newmont. And I know that right up there on the list in addition to the mine of the future is the opportunity for us to look at bringing newer technology into this. So, it is something that we're looking at.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay, great. And many thanks, great results, well done, thanks.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Victor Flores from HSBC.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Thanks, good morning. I have a few questions with respect to Hope Bay. Could you tell us how much was spent at Hope Bay during 2008 and how much of that was to upgrade the infrastructure and how much of that was actually drilling out the resource?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, I am going to ask Guy Lansdown to answer that question.
Guy Lansdown: Good morning Victor. The focus as Richard said last year was on setting ourselves up to operate safely and environmentally compliance and to build a team. So the bulk of that spend last year was on infrastructure which included upgrading our JD, roads, camps and other infrastructure and that was about $80 million, $82 million was actually the number we ended up spending on it. As far as the remainder of the expenditure went, we spent about $40 million on combination of exploration and study work. And our focus going forward would be on an aggressive exploration program and continued work on optimizing and value adding certain options for the project.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Can you tell us how much you are planning on spending this year?
Guy Lansdown: Yeah, we are looking at spending around $50 million to $60 million between study work and exploration work, and again a big effort on an aggressive exploration program focusing on drilling and identifying targets across the district.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Okay. Now I see from the slides that for this year you are planning 35,000 meters of drilling which for a project of this scale seems like a fairly modest amount and it seems like if you are spending 50 million to 60 million, there is money going into other things than drilling because 35,000 meters should cost a lot lesser. Is that correct?
Guy Lansdown: Yes that's right on Victor. We actually said we want to spend, we are targeting more than 35,000 meters. It's a function of the number of drill weeks we've got up there at present as you might well understand that logistics are pretty tough. We can only work with what we've got at present and we're looking to maximize immediately as we get out of those drill weeks throughout the remainder of the year. But as you rightly pointed out, there is a lot of other work going on. As I said, identifying targets in the region and that I think is the various development options that we've got at our disposal.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Great, thank you. If I could just ask a quick question on Yanacocha, can you tell us how much of the production will come from the heap leach and how many tons you plan to put under leach, and how much will come from the mill?
Russell Ball: This is Russ. I'll get you that analysis later. I actually don't have that in front of me.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Okay. That's great, thank you Russ. Thank you, that's all my questions.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks Victor.
Operator: Our next question is from David Haughton from BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Well good morning and thank you. Just following on from a little bit more break out on the CapEx expectation in 2009, what sort of CapEx are you expecting to spend on the development projects like Conga, Akyem and also Boddington in 2009?
Richard O'Brien: The Boddington number I think I gave 750 million of the 875 to 925 in Australia relates to Boddington. And most of that is related to just completing the current project getting it up running and getting the mills turning and producing. So there is really not any additional on capital at Boddington. We've already bought the trucks and most of that is just related to completion. With respect to Akyem, we're probably spending around $20 million or so during the year to continue to push that with respect to Conga probably $30 plus million to move that along this year and Guy gave you the Hope Bay project numbers.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Is the Conga number included in the Yanacocha kind of CapEx guidance that we've seen previous or is this just a separate number?
Russell Ball: Yes, David it is.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And with GQ West Wall, it seems to have accelerated very quickly from Stage 1 to Stage 3. I guess it's a Brownfield development which makes it easy. Can you give us a little bit of an idea as to what your production could be on a go forward basis?
Richard O'Brien: What the project does is that it extends the life of the mine. That's really the future CapEx or laybacks for the project again focusing on the long-term for Nevada. It wouldn't come into operation immediately but as you say we know the asset well and it is an extension. We put a lot of dollars into drilling around the pit to get better an understanding of the extent of it and it's really just going to add the mine life by six years or so.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, does all of that layback fall within the newly acquired Franco royalty footprint?
Richard O'Brien: I can't answer that, I don't know for sure.
John Seaberg: David, this is John, I'll get back to you on that as far as much how much is in the property versus non property.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And with interest the progression at Batu Hijau, as far as going into the higher grade material, will we still see in 2009 the seasonality of moving into the bottom of the pit in the dryer second and third quarter or is this staging going to overprint that seasonality a bit?
Russell Ball: David, its Russell. At Batu we have and as you are well aware the second and third quarter is essential when we're able to get into the bottom of the pit. So the mine sequencing is really just a function of the wet season which ends roughly in April and starts up again in roughly October and it moves the month or so either side. So just as you saw this year our ability to access the high grade at the bottom of the pit is a function of the wet season. How long it comes and how much rain we get.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so as we are progressing into a much better year in 2009 we should still have more overloading in that second, third quarter than in the first and fourth?
Russell Ball: Absolutely.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Richard O'Brien: Could I just overlay on the answer of that question just a little bit about the Nevada projects that we're working on. As you've seen in the production estimates and cost estimates for 2009, we're seeing decline in Nevada. Brant Hinze and his team and Brian Hill, our Executive Vice President of Operations are really focused on providing a couple of things in Nevada. One is access to oxide, when we can find it as in the Gold Quarry West lay back. In addition to that as I discussed at Turf, we are looking at trying to extend the life of Nevada through higher grade additions underground. And so we have a number of things going on there, Brant and his team are focused on really trying to offset the decline in Nevada to reserve extensions and that's exactly as we talked about with respect to the Gold Quarry West Wall.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Mark Linamos (ph) from Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. With some of the successes you've had over the last year, could you comment at all about whether you think there's opportunities to get more aggressive with growth or is it still best to think about the companies of five plus million ounce producers steady state? Thanks.
Richard O'Brien: Yes, I guess just as a highlight I know it's a small number but we actually are projecting growth this year. It's slight but there is little bit of growth this year and I think as we look out, you're exactly right. One of the things that we need to do is continue to sustain what we have and we have a number of things going on to try to make that happen. The Boddington and the purchase of a third from Anglo is really the key to us over the next year providing some growth. Beyond that, we have a number of things that we're going to need to complete including the additions of Conga and Akyem to help offset the decline that we have from our maturing assets at Yanacocha and in Nevada. So overall I think this company continues to rest around that 5.25 million ounce level and I think at that level with the continued exposure to a non-hedged gold portfolio, we continue to believe that if we can sustain that, provide the leverage that we have and extend our reserve life through other mechanisms, I think that's how you should view this company.
Unidentified Analyst: Great and any update on the metallurgical issues at Phoenix that you have been working on which you drove further?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, as we announced in the third quarter of last year, Brant Hinze and his team did a terrific job of bringing forward the Phoenix mine plan and at that time, we really did lock in a metallurgical program which over the really the first three quarters of 2008, the last half of 2007 really did define the metallurgy pretty well there. And I think as we said, we have clearly a little more exposure to copper there than gold when we redid the mine plan and because of that, one of the things that we're going to be watching at Phoenix is maybe less about the project in metallurgy recovery because its actually really right on top of plan at the current time. It's certainly going to be exposed to copper prices because that byproduct credit is going to be important to us in terms of keeping the cost down at Phoenix. So we're pretty confident in the mine plan, the team over there really took a lot of care during 2008 to come forward with the plan that they believe is deliverable. And as I've mentioned on just about every call, executing against our plans is really our number one objective when Phoenix came forward with their plan, they clearly understood that I expected they're going to deliver on it.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. And good luck with the rest of the plan this year.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur from UBS Security.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: Good morning. I got on a little late so I apologize at this for that, but has the valuation for the sell down for 2008 and Batu Hijau have been done yet?
Richard O'Brien: For 2008?
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: Yeah.
Russell Ball: Brian, Russ. We have an ongoing efforts to finalize that valuation and we'll be submitting it prior to the end of March to the Department of Mines and Energy.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: So that will happen before the arbitration is done?
Russell Ball: That's for 2009.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: Well sorry.
Russell Ball: Offsetting '08 valuations?
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: Right.
Russell Ball: Yes, that valuation will be submitted by March 31, 2009 to the Indonesian government.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Security: Okay. Great, thanks very much.
Richard O'Brien: Pleasure.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Hill (ph) from Cambridge Environment (ph).
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the very detailed presentation. Just curious with the improvement expected that too in terms of grades and volumes for 2009. Where are we on the over burdened storage and the forest issues, in other words volume breakthroughs on the negotiating front, how sustainable are these results?
Richard O'Brien: We haven't really made any significant progress with the advancing of pinjam pakai permit, and that is still an issue that we're trying to keep moving forward. Part of our plan now, we're actually in Phase V, we don't have any real significant stripping left to do in Phase V. Most of where we're at with the production plan is, its either going directly to the mill or its going on to the various stock piles we have. What's really more of the issue around the permit is looking at the next phases of expansion which would be going in to Phase VI.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks. And then just a quick follow up on Phoenix, obviously a lot of work on the metallurgy and there is some chemistry in there. How about the real basics, how are we doing on the crushing plant and throughput there?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, we got the new crusher up in the fourth quarter of last year. Everything seems to be operating just as we planned. And throughputs actually I think really again right on plan. For Phoenix, maybe even a little bit higher than planned.
Unidentified Analyst: So right now throughputs is at design and recoveries are also at I guess revised targets?
Richard O'Brien: Yes, yes, pretty much, you know, and we're two quarters into it right. So really it's going to take sometime to shake it out, make sure it stays there. But for right now things look to be the way that we had imagined them to be.
Unidentified Analyst: Well it's been a long road there. So, good work. Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you to Brant and his team over there.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question come Wayne Atwell from (inaudible) Capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Could you pass on your thoughts about the portfolio review in the sense that properties that maybe just don't fit into your portfolio, the grades aren't high enough, the costs aren't correct, too small and that you might be planning to put on the market and make it available to someone else and what kind of proceeds might you generate?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, I think at the present time I would say, we have a portfolio of projects that we stand pretty pat on. We last year sold out probably the last of the underground facilities in Nevada, sorry in Australia that we care to sell off. The others we believe we continue to have pretty good reserve life in front of us with some more definitional drilling, obviously on the underground. KCGM in Australia, we're working closely with that to make sure we come up with the optimal plan there. We'll continue to evaluate that one. But I think otherwise around the world we feel pretty pat with where we are with our portfolio right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Alright, so with that I want to thank you all for your attention and I appreciate the effort that you guys make to continue to follow the company. Any questions, I know John, Russ others will be available for you after the call. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today to discuss Newmont's financial results for the third quarter. With me in the room today are several members of Newmont's management team who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, I need to once again remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings. Turning to slide three, when I became CEO of Newmont, the strategic direction that I framed for our employees, our management team, and our shareholders was centered on a renewed focus on our core business and a commitment to daily operational and project execution. Execution should be measurable, and just over a year and a quarter later, our strategic foundation is comprised of exactly the same principles and we openly measure our performance against our metrics on a quarterly basis with this corporate scorecard. As illustrated on the slide, we clearly have made substantial progress over the last 16 months. But it's also evident by the unchecked boxes that we have much work left to do. As we continue to execute on our plans, we are again maintaining our original 2008 production and cost guidance. We keep this particular box unchecked however as a constant reminder that this is a daily requirement of our business. On our second quarter earnings call, we highlighted the successful delivery of two major projects, the Yanacocha gold mill and Nevada Power Plant. Both of which are performing better than expected. We still have one major project in the execution stage, Boddington. As I'll talk about in a moment, we are revising upward our capital cost on this project. And we must now absolutely ensure that the project is delivered on schedule and within the revised cost guidance. We continue to work on our major development projects those been Conga in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada and Akyem in Ghana to our stage gate process. However, considering the global financial market turmoil we are reviewing the ultimate development and timing of each of those projects. We also continue to work on resolving the Batu Hijau divestiture issue in Indonesia. Newmont and our partners Semi Tumol [ph] have selected our arbitrator as has the Indonesian government and together we have selected an independent arbitrator. The initial arbitration hearings are scheduled for December. As we have said all along, Newmont remains committed to our divestiture obligations defined in the contract of work. We will keep you informed as we progress through the arbitration process. Turmoil in the financial markets has dominated the news over the last several months. Due to the current volatility in gold and other commodity prices as well as the collapse of the global financial markets, we will exercise even greater discipline, actively managing our capital projects, our exploration, and our other spending and taking prudent steps to preserve our balance sheet strength and liquidity, while maintaining the flexibility and optionality we have in our project development in our exploration pipeline. We will continue to balance short-term market gyrations with the long-term positive view we have on developing exploring for and acquiring gold resources. Moving to the next slide, as we look at the year-to-date and third quarter highlights, I'm pleased to report another quarter of solid operating and financial results as we continue focus on operational and project execution and importantly, we are maintaining our annual equity goal sales and costs applicable to sales guidance for 2008. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $176 million or $0.39 per share and we reported net income of $196 million or $0.43 per share. These results were adversely impacted by our mark-to-market loss on provisional copper sales of approximately $0.03 per share. The previous year's quarter was positively impacted by copper sales from Batu Hijau as we were mining from the bottom of Phase IV and sold 163 million pounds of copper or roughly four times that sold in this quarter. As we have explained previously, the production of Batu was a function of mine sequencing. And we expect to be back in the bottom of the pit in Phase V in 2010 and 2011. During the third quarter, we sold approximately 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at an average realized gold price of $865 per ounce, at cost applicable to sales of $480 per ounce. Resulting in net cash provided from continuing operations of approximately $200 million or $0.44 per share. Despite lower gold and copper prices in the third quarter, for the year we've generated net cash provided from our continuing operations of approximately $1.2 billion. Looking at our equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales by region, we're generally performing inline with our plans. In Nevada, we sold 544,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Slightly lower than our expectations, primarily due to the continued suspension of operations at the Getchell mine and the Yukon Nevada gold processing facility. We also experienced slower recoveries at the Carlin South and Twin Creeks leech pads and lower throughput at Midas. We still expect to be on track for the year as we anticipate making up much of the shortfall in the fourth quarter as the ounces come off of leech pads later this year. Cost applicable to sales of $497 per ounce during the third quarter were also higher than expected, due to lower than expected gold sales, continued higher diesel and contracted service costs, and lower byproduct credits due to lower copper prices and volumes, partially offset by energy savings from a full quarter of commercial operation at the Nevada power plant. At Yanacocha, our sales were slightly ahead of expectations as a change in mine sequencing earlier in this year resulted in more leech tons placed during the second quarter, leading to higher production in the third quarter as these ounces began coming off the pads. In addition, production from the recently completed gold mill exceeded expectations with throughput, grades, and recoveries all higher than expected. In Australia, we continue to benefit from higher grades at Jundee and higher recovery at both Jundee and Wahi, which were partially offset by lower grades and recoveries at Kalgoorlie and Tanami. The higher than expected sales also contributed to driving our costs applicable to sales for the region lower than our original expectations. At Batu Hijau, equity and gold copper sales were lower than expectations, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments that resulted in equity gold and copper production of 20,000 ounces and 11 million pounds respectively not being shipped during the quarter. Our estimates indicate that that this build-up of inventory at the end of the quarter increased our costs applicable to sales by approximately $115 per ounce and $0.27 per pound. In addition, equity gold and copper production was slightly lower than planned as throughput was lower than expected due to harder Phase V ore and limited access to Phase IV ore caused by extensive rainfall, as we talked about during the first half of 2008. At Ahafo in Ghana we sold 141,000 ounces in the quarter, slightly higher than budget as we continue to see higher grades and recoveries partially offset by lower throughput. We continue to benefit from higher than planned availability of power from the Volta River Authority which has again had a positive impact on our costs applicable to sales despite a rate increase for power that came into affect on July 1st of this year. And finally, costs applicable to sales in our other operations were significantly higher than expected, primarily due to costs applicable to sales of approximately $1,300 per ounce for the quarter at due to Kori Kollo in Bolivia due to a leech pad write-off, as a result of lower than anticipated recoveries, additional Bolivian royalties and higher fuel costs. Slide six demonstrates our costs applicable to sales would have been, if we were able to use copper revenues at Batu Hijau and cash distributions from investment in Canadian oil sands, trust as the credit to our costs. As illustrated in the chart, our GAAP costs of $438 per ounce would have been $339 per ounce net of copper revenues and the distributions from Canadian oil sands trust. As reflected on slide seven, we've made some minor adjustments to our regional costs applicable to sales guidance, but we're pleased to report that we are once again maintaining our 2008 equity sale guidance between 5.1 million and 5.4 million ounces and our costs applicable to sales guidance of $425 to $450 per ounce. We're also maintaining our current copper sales guidance between 125 million and 150 million pounds and our costs applicable to sales of $1.50 to $1.75 per pound. Slide eight summarizes the rest of our financial guidance as of the end of the quarter. We slightly increased our interest expense guidance to reflect higher borrowing costs and it was slightly lower to our effective tax guidance, reflecting revised estimates for reserves for our uncertain tax positions. All other guidance remains unchanged. Slide nine illustrates the depth and breadth of our project pipeline and where each project fits within our stage gate framework. I won't go into detail on each of these project, but I want to continue to emphasize that we have several multi-million ounce gold deposits in stage two and above, and that we have flexibility with respect to the development schedules related to those projects. As previously mentioned, all stage gate decisions are undergoing additional scrutiny as a result of volatility in the markets. Turning to slide ten, I want to talk about Boddington. At the end of the third quarter, the project was 85% complete. We continue to expect project startup in early to mid-2009. With respect to the capital estimate, during our second quarter earnings call and at the Denver Gold Show in September, we committed to finalizing the review of capital costs and discussing those costs at this time. Based on our newly revised estimate, our capital cost estimate now stands at $1.4 billion to 1.6 billion... sorry, we have moved our capital cost estimate from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.7 million to $1.9 billion. That is Newmont share for the Boddington project. About half of the capital cost escalation from our previous guidance is a direct result of an approximate three-month schedule expansion. Mainly due to the lack of construction resources with the remaining 50% attributable to cost escalation primarily labor and fuel. Now that the project is 85% complete, and knowing that we have approximately 90% of the remaining capital expenditures hedged, we're confident that we will deliver on our revised guidance for Boddington. With the first five years of production averaging 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold to Newmont's account at below industry costs applicable to sales. Boddington remains a cornerstone asset for the company and it will remain so for a long period of time as Boddington's life should be in excess of 20 years. I'd now like to take a few moments to address the recent financial market turmoil and how Newmont is responding to these unprecedented times. The global financial crisis has clearly resulted in massive liquidation of portfolios across the board. Access to capital has essentially disappeared. For those lucky enough to be able to access the markets, it is very costly when, as and if you can get access to those markets. And commodity prices are extremely volatile and we would argue not reflective of the long-term fundamentals that typically drive commodity prices, our share price and also we believe that those commodity prices are undervalued even in the short-term. Newmont is well positioned in these volatile times with a strong liquid balance sheet and an investment grade rating. Our Stage Gate process will also serve us well as we must now exercise even more discipline in how we invest our capital and develop our projects. As you've seen previously, we do have an extensive project pipeline. We will be reviewing it continuously for adequate project return, to ensure we maintain an appropriate risk profile and that we continue to focus on positive cash flow generation for the business. With respect to our three largest new projects that I mentioned earlier, Conga in Peru, Hope Bay in Canada and Akyem in Ghana all of these Stage Gate decisions are under review until we fully understand the impact of today's adverse market conditions. In fact, as you would expect, all of our budgets are currently under review. Despite recent lower commodity prices, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for the gold price. On the supply side, existing mine production continues to decline and while the credit crisis continues even fewer new projects will be developed, further squeezing gold supplies. We believe this will be exacerbated by tightening exploration budgets and new gold discoveries have already become hard to find. Looking at the financial indicators, although the U.S. dollar has strengthened relative to the euro recently, we believe the U.S. dollar will decline relative to Asian currencies as the U.S. government continues to inject liquidity into the market at unprecedented rates. That will be good for gold price. And finally, we've seen gold's equity evaluations come down in this market as people have had to liquidate their portfolios and raise cash. As a result, we will continue to monitor the industry and be opportunistic with respect to accretive acquisitions to augment our growth strategy. To couple of slides quickly on our liquidity profile. As I said, we must continue to focus on this. Slide 12 summarizes our current liquidity position as of the end of the quarter. As you can see on this slide, we have cash and marketable securities of about $1.9 billion, plus an additional $700 million capacity under our revolver. And as this slide shows, the next slide, our liquidity profile on the previous slide provides significant capacity to repay our debt for the next several years as well as sufficient capital to complete Boddington. Thus, even at lower gold and copper prices, we don't need to go to the market to raise capital currently to deliver on our plans. In closing, our company and our industry are currently operating in an unprecedented macro business environment, consisting of extreme commodity price volatility uncertainty, mass portfolio of liquidation, global inflation and limited, if any, access to capital. However, Newmont is well positioned to respond to this market uncertainty with a strong liquid balance sheet within an investment grade rating. We have an attractive project pipeline nevertheless within a disciplined stage-gate framework allowing maximum flexibility and the preservation of optionality with respect to the timing of the development of our next major projects. We will continue to evaluate the acquisition landscape to be opportunistic if and when an accretive acquisition arises that adds value for our shareholders. Before finishing our presentation today, I'd like to take a moment to pay honor to the life Ron Keen, a long time employee at our Nevada operation, who recently died in an accident at one of our Carlin truck shops. Safety is our number one priority at Newmont and we take it personally everyday. Whenever we have a tragic accident like this we redouble our efforts to ensure our employees remain safe. We are keeping Ron's family in our thoughts as they go through this difficult time. And with that, I would like to think you all for listening and open it up for questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is PatrickChidley with BJM.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacob Mellet Securities: Yes, hi good morning everybody. My question goes to the low tax rate that you reported for the quarter. Maybe you could expand on that.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Patrick, I'll ask Dave Gutierrez, VP of Tax and Accounting to speak you through at a high level. I will just point you to a slide if we could just flip through to, I think it's slide 17 which shows the reconciliation of GAAP net income to the normalized income. And if you have a look at that slide, you'll see there are two tax adjustments on that slide which we took into account to reflect the lower tax rate for the quarter. So if you... we're just pulling it up on the screen here. Hopefully, we can get... 16, I think it is, Patrick, yes, hold on. Let us get there. So if you have a look at the slide 16, which hopefully is up on your screen or if you have the presentation downloaded, you'll see two adjustments, essentially adding back for tax planning during the quarter, the $19 million that showed up in discontinued operations which related to the Newmont Capital IPO as we trued up our tax estimate for the gain. Remember, we took that gain on sales through discontinued operations. So we took the tax gain through. So we added that $19 million back because clearly that related to a once off type transaction. And then the other $18 million that you see up top that we're reducing to get to adjusted income relates to tax restructuring. On the big restructuring that you saw in Q2, which you'll see in the year-to-date column now shows up as $147 million. So we reflected both of those in trying to get to an adjusted net income number. And I'll have Dave speak to some of the detail on the quarter.
David V. Gutierrez - Vice President, Tax and Accounting: Right. For the quarter, we had... we released from our reserve for uncertain tax position amounts related to several items that resolved with the Internal Revenue Service. Also, as Russell also mentioned, the restructuring true up occurred not only regarding the IPO sale from last year, but also in terms of the filing of our tax return for 2007 where we had incremental amounts of depletion related to the operations for 2007. So those are the primary drivers for the quarter.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacob Mellet Securities: Okay. And can you tell me when you choose to release amounts from the reserves, is that done at your discretion or is it done according to a scheduled timetable?
David V. Gutierrez - Vice President, Tax and Accounting: No. Our policy is to release reserves only when items are resolved with governmental agency or the statute has lapsed. So in the quarter, since our U.S. tax return for 2002 to 2004 got resolved, most of the matters got resolved in this quarter, we released the reserves related to those years.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacob Mellet Securities: Okay. And how much was that?
David V. Gutierrez - Vice President, Tax and Accounting: It was approximately $30 million.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacob Mellet Securities: Okay. All right, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from John Bridges with JPMC.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Good morning, Dick, everybody.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: HeyJohn.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Just wanted to play devil's advocate here a little. Congratulations on staying on track with your production target. But when we spoke a year or so ago, just trying to figure out what the right approach was with goldmines, particularly given how the gold ETS has been performing, showing investors like to see gold actually stay within the companies. And any thoughts on producing versus keeping gold in the ground after another year in the seat?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good question John. I think one of the goals that we have at the company is to continue to look at preserving the reserves that we have and adding to them over time that so that we can really have a long-term, more sustainable business model. Whether or not producing today versus holding gold in the ground is a fundamental way that we would decide that is still I think up for discussion. The reason for that is because we already have assets in the ground, trying to get return on those assets through positive cash flow generation is absolutely a priority for us. I think at the margin, your question really comes to more marginal ounces with higher cost, both capital and operating costs related to them. And I think as we have continued to look at the business model here, as we look towards the future for generating gross positive cash flow from each of the pits we operate from, I think more and more we will be taking a look at marginal production to see if that marginal production actually does makes sense to produce now or to leave in the ground. So I think we will continue to balance mine plans, which at some point demand that we either produce or leave behind ounces with positive cash flow generation as sort of the targets that we're looking at. And in this kind of market, John, I think that question is really one that we will have to answer here even as we look into next year.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, Russ. Just adding to that. In the short term, we did leave a little bit of ounces in the ground as you'll note looking at the third quarter and backing into the year, the 5.1 to 5.4. As we said, we did leave some ounces in the Bodd... in Batu Hijau in Indonesia. Those will come out. We are out of the bottom of the pit effective basically today with the rainy season having started. But we will see a better fourth quarter there. And Nevada again, we've loaded the ounces on the pad, so those will hopefully come out in the fourth quarter. Again, we are trying to get away from that back-end weighting as we've spoken to you folks about for a year now. Some events transpired this quarter which have pushed some of that third quarter production into Q4. So that's the shorter term picture.
Operator: Our next question is from Heather Douglas with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi, good morning everyone. I was hoping you can give us a little bit more color on what is happening at Boddington. You said in your release that it's 85% test complete. What still needs to be done sort of the steps for commissioning over the 12 months next year? And can you tell us what your revised cost estimates are, in particular some per ton costs?
Guy Lansdown - Executive Vice President, Development: Yes, this Guy. Good day to you Heather. Heather, we are 85% complete as you've correctly said. We have the remainder of construction to complete, which is mainly the mechanical/electrical component of the project. And from that we'll go into commissioning and startup. It will be a phased approach which we will start early next year. And through the end of the first quarter, early second quarter, we will begin to start up the plants and commence our journey into an approximate one year ramp up. So I think that's... I hope that adds a bit of color for you around what's left in terms of construction.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Heather, it's Russ. As far as the cost per ton, we're actually reviewing our assumptions right now. I'll say back in July when we started our '09 budget and business plan, our assumptions for example were 900 gold, 350 copper and 125 oil. Clearly, the world has changed in the last couple of months. So we are going through a review process. In addition, what's going to cause us a little bit of accounting consternation is the delay in start up, which takes some of those mining costs and pushes them into capital. As Dick mentioned earlier, most of it or about half of the capital cost increase is related to schedule. So we take some of those mining costs and essentially capitalize them. So we are working through that. Again, we had an 87.5 in Aussie dollar assumption; the world today looking at around 64 cents makes it very different. So as we get numbers and we give you our '09 numbers in late February, we'll be able to give you some more color around individual operations and can address that point then.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: And just follow up on that. We have said, Heather, that we do anticipate that the all-in cost applicable to sales at Boddington will be at or below industry averages, and that's something that we continue to believe.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: In terms of a follow up, how much mining is... are you stockpiling right now because of the delays at the plant?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, we're busy stripping at the moment Heather. So we're taking non-ore material to waste at the moment. We do not intend stockpiling significant amounts of material.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: And as far as the phased approach for a start up, if we were trying to model throughput, we would put very little then in the first half of next year and then back-end loaded like what sort of throughput?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, that's certainly correct. It's going to be a gradual one year ramp up with not significant production in the second half of this year.
Heather Douglas - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Dudas with Jefferies.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Co.: Good morning everybody.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Mike.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Co.: First question is relative to where A dollar is, relative to where energy prices are, and of course they change every moment it seems, very volatile, what's your viewpoint on aggressiveness relative to lock in as best you can current type levels of those commodities, especially given your viewpoint on where gold prices should be?
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mike, Russ. Good question. Yes, extreme volatility. What we have in place is a layered, structured and disciplined hedging on the Aussie dollar. We've been lagging into that for about a year now. We have accelerated that in the recent times to reflect what we believe is a dislocation with the Aussie trading in the low 60s. So we continue to lag into that. We will essentially, and it's a two year program. So if you think out 18 months, you're effectively around 40% hedged; 18 months out, closer to 80% on the short end. As far as energy, we're doing a little bit in Nevada. But to be quite honest, Mike, it's tough to get a derivative instrument that qualifies for effectiveness accounting. So as we look at some of the other parts of the world, the way the pricing structures work, we would induce significant volatility. So we haven't done a lot other than in the U.S. where there is a liquid market and a tradable instrument that meets the effectiveness testing. In addition, don't forget we have about a quarter of that well hedged to Canadian Oil Sands Trust, although it doesn't show up as a hedge obviously on the income statement. So in short, stepping up a little on the Aussie dollar, we have locked in. I mean as Dick mentioned earlier, essentially all other capital that we have eliminated that risk and we are aggressively adding to our position for operating cost for at least the next two year [ph] period.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Co.: Thank you. My second question is, Dick, compared to six to nine months ago and given the gross deterioration of capital access and cost, has there been a major change in the ability to maybe add to upgrade inventory through your stage gate process through acquisitions? And is that something that may be in this time of uncertainty, you might be more... looking at more closely.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well a couple of things on that. I'd say we continue to maintain our fundamental belief that we need to build the business through exploration project development and acquisition. With respect to exploration and project development, I think we have a fairly sizable portfolio in both. And what we'll be looking at is trying to maintain options while focusing on positive cash flow generation for the company, which means that some projects in the pipeline will surely be delayed, but we won't loose them. It will mean that some exploration projects will be delayed, but likely we won't loose them. With respect to acquisitions in particular, as I said, I believe that relative value for Newmont continues to put us in a position where we can now, and I believe we will over time, be able to look at that relative valuation. And whether it's projects in development that others can't complete because they have liquidity issues, whether it's exploration projects that we might be able to acquire instead of spending our own exploration dollars because the purchase of those may be cheaper than the development or whether it's looking at other companies that might have relative valuations that have comparatively declined relative to ours. I think all of those things will be on the table for us. And it's an ill wind that doesn't blow somebody some good. And I'm hopeful that we are going to be one of those companies that will benefit because we're going to stick to our business, we are going to generate positive cash flow, we will maintain our investment grade rating and I think all of that should over time bode well for Newmont.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Co.: Well said. My final question, Dick, is this might be an easy one for you. You think there is a... could you maybe discuss the disconnect that we might be seeing in the financial markets for gold in the physical markets?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I will attempt to do so and then maybe Russ and John can jump in. But what we've seen and heard is that the physical demand for gold right now is very tight. Coins are less and less available. We have heard that there are people who are trying to borrow gold in the marketplace and finding that it's difficult to come by. That physical demand should translate to higher gold prices. And I think on the other side is just the fear that people have at the moment that holding any asset maybe even other than a U.S. treasury, which now will get you the fine yield of 0.6, I think it's something that people really are worried about. And I don't think it goes to the fundamental value of gold; I think that fundamental value has unfortunately relative to their fear has slipped. So I think what I see is people trying to move towards treasuries, and I think over time as we see the U.S. continue to print money, I think we will see gold price come back in that fundamental, physical, the currency aspects, the supply and demand imbalance, I think all of those things will positively impact --
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Mike, Russ. Just adding maybe a quick comment. What we've heard anecdotally is clearly cash is king with margin close in charge. And it's not so much a question of what you want to sell, but it's what you can sell. In gold, one of the benefits it has is its liquidity and the fact that is the store of wealth and money. So we've seen indiscriminate selling to generate cash to repay and deleverage. Particularly on the hedge fund side, we have seen related to windows of hedge fund redemptions significant selling in the futures market despite the strong physical. So I think you will see that process unwind, and to Dick's point, if these fundamentals start asserting themselves longer term. But I think short term, and I think short term could be up to a couple of years in a very volatile market where cash is king and fear is paramount. And we're seeing that and unfortunately gold is getting sold along with everything else.
Michael Dudas - Jefferies & Co.: You would think those margin parts [ph] would accept gold coins, but depending on what they look like. Thank you gentlemen.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Barry Cooper with CIBC.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Yes, good morning everyone. Dick or maybe Russ, because I think you've been more intimately involved in this, and there is a question that I'm sure that you want to answer or maybe that you can answer. But just wondering about the whole negotiation process at Batu Hijau. What's likely to take place in terms of peoples' expectations and what not given the regime that we're in right now? Obviously, commodity prices have moved around dramatically. You've had an agreement on kind of valuation, which obviously I would say at this point in time is up for big negotiation changes. Then you had the whole issue of the other side getting the money in order to come up with their share of the component. Obviously, a lot of moving parts there and what not. Just can you offer any sort of expectations of what we might see in the coming months and whether this is something that perhaps just drags on forever?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Barry, it's Dick. Let me start and then Russ can add to this if he needs to. What I would say is with respect to what can we say, we can tell you what we've said in the past. We can't really predict where this is going to go. But what we have said in the past is we are absolutely committed to living under... living up to the divestiture requirements under the contract of work. Under that contract of work, unfortunately, we've ended up in a position where because of some of the points that you raised with respect to how do we sell, really, there has not been an issue around evaluation today. But the how do we sell and to whom that really has led us to the point where we did end up in arbitration. That is scheduled for the first part of December. As I've said, as Russ and others at the company and I have told the government, we are continuing to hope that we can figure out a way to resolve this through continued discussions with the regional governments. If we can get that done and we can agree on the appropriate terms, we could move forward in another direction. That, however, is an alternative; it's not the main focus at the present time. So we continue to look at valuations in the commodities. We have not set the 2008 valuation yet; the other valuations that were set historically. So it is difficult for us to call at the moment other than we know we will have to divest. It's something that we actually acknowledge and really want to get done. And we're still just trying to figure out through arbitration how exactly do we get that done.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Dick, does the historical valuation bear any relevance today?
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Barry, very good point. And again, our contract of work, which is a 68 page document, spells out basically the A to Z of operating that mine. It clearly never contemplated a situation such as this where divestiture wasn't affected around about the time of the valuation and we've seen a dislocation. I will say, though, that as we've mentioned before, the '07 valuation was at 4 billion... '06 valuation at $6 billion, '07 at $6 billion on a 100% basis. Clearly, when you look at today's multiples and lower short-term cash flows, it will impact that. But key in that valuation is your long-term assumptions because again when we get to the bottom of phase VI which happens out in 16, 17, 18 timeframe, there's a lot of cash flow. So it is dependent on your long-term view and you've got to navigate through the short-term chop clearly. The other issue with the ill wind that Dick spoke to earlier is that some of the competing companies that had expressed an interest in providing finance to some of the local governments, the FT article as you probably remember from February, their financial situation has changed markedly with current market dislocation, and a lot of that is public and you can read about it. But suffice to say, the ability of people to raise what's approximately $400 million for a 10% non-controlling interest has been reduced. And we'll have to work through what that means. I think short term, though, we are all proceeding on the divestiture track. The government has honored its obligations. We will expect a decision sometime in the end of the first quarter, second quarter next year. We still remain very confident in our merits... in the merits of our case at least. The resolution we have asked for is that we are allowed to divest on essentially the business-to-business, which means we'll divest or we're asking for relief to divest to Indonesian parties essentially of our choosing. We have identified a number of those that we believe are very aligned with our operating philosophy and we hope to be able to effect that transaction shortly after we get a result from the arbitration panel.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Do you think you would entertain, in essence financing those groups yourself with basically loans with payback through cash flow?
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Barry, we have. We offered in November '07 exactly that type of non-recourse structure where we would keep the economic interest and the loans would be non-recoursed to the local governments who we do want as our local partners. At the time there were some competing bids, there wasn't a lot of transparency into some of that. But we have seen some key government changes which have change the landscape so to speak and then with the financial situation, we believe that our offer becomes even more compelling. So we're working through that as a parallel path to arbitration.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Right. Okay, good enough then. Thanks a lot. I guess we'll just stay tuned.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Stay tuned Barry, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Individual Research.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC: Thank you. Could you just review your Australian dollar hedging that remains for project execution or operations?
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes John, Russ. We've got a fair amount of disclosure if you look at the 10-Q which got filed this morning. We have a table in there which refers to our hedging and derivative exposure. If you look it at end of the September and again we have been pretty active in October, but at end of September, we have a table which shows about $648 million hedged over the next three years those U.S. dollars at average rate of around $0.84. And we have a de minimus amount of Australian... of New Zealand dollars hedged under a similar program.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Doody with Gold Stock Analyst.
John Doody - Gold Stock Analyst: Hi, good morning and thank you for the details so far. My question has to do with the forecast assumptions. We are finally cash... the costs are going in your favor. And before on oil, you had earlier said that the sensitivity of oil was $10 a barrel was equivalent to about a $4 cash cost per ounce. And is that still true with your lowered oil forecast now? And also I wonder if you could give a sensitivity with the exchange rate to the Australian dollar particularly given that you're hedged at $0.84 versus the assumption you are using now of 75.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, so John on oil with Boddington ramping up now, we're just over 3. So if you use somewhere between 3 and 3.5 million barrels a year, that is our oil exposure. Again, its two very different markets, its very different pricing mechanisms, but that will give you a feel for our exposure, and that correlation does hang true. We have a small hedge program but it doesn't move it. So you can use that as a good rule of thumb for your sensitivities. On the Australian dollar, again if you look on the earnings release on page one; there is a paragraph in which talks about CAS and the sensitivity to the Australian dollar. And you'll see the sensitivity there. Again, as Boddington ramps up, that will start to increase as our Aussie dollar spend increases.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'd just emphasize that for now it's $1 for every $10 change in oil prices, it's getting only up on both of that... and that's the reason that the significant number has come down from the number you mentioned. And as we said in the earnings release, it's $1 per ounce for every $0.10 change in the Australian rate. So as we get deeper into the year, the range really tightens because we only have one quarter left.
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And John, you'll see we used the lower oil in the table. For the forecast, we used 75. What we do see is a lag and we talked about this last quarter where we will bill cost and inventory. So we do have costs in inventory that will come out in the fourth quarter where we were paying $145 oil. So you don't see it immediately; there is a lag of call it six to eight weeks.
John Doody - Gold Stock Analyst: Okay. So it looks at this stage, it looks your fourth quarter cash costs per ounce are going to come in around whatever your year-to-date is, about 438. Can you confirm that?
Russell Ball - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's about right John.
John Doody - Gold Stock Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right, I want to thank you all for your attention today and your questions. And you can count on us to go back to work and continue executing on our plans. We look forward to talking to you in February. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome to the Newmont Mining Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Richard O'Brien, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call today to discuss our financial results for the second quarter. With me in the room today are several members of Newmont's management team who will be available and can identify themselves when they answer questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, I need to remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as further described in our SEC filings. As we look at slide three, we show the highlights of the second quarter. And I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of operating and financial results, as our focus on operational and project execution continues to pay off. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $230 million or $0.51 per share slightly ahead of consensus and we reported net income of $0.61 per share. With the benefit of strong gold prices and a continued focus on cost control, we generated substantial operating cash flow, reporting adjusted cash flow from continuing operations of $382 million or $0.84 per share. For the quarter, we sold approximately 1.3 million equity ounces of gold at average realized gold price of $900 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were $440 per ounce, only 6% higher than a year ago and clearly within our guidance for the year of between $425 and $450 per ounce. In addition to strong operating performance, our ability to execute on our projects is improving as we completed two major projects during the quarter, declaring commercial production at both the Nevada Power Plant and the Yanacocha gold mill. And finally, and probably most notably, in spite of higher energy prices and a strengthening Australian dollar, we are maintaining our original guidance for equity gold sales and costs applicable to sales for the quarter... for the year... for the year, sorry. Slide four is all about delivering gold price leverage and compares some of our highlighted financial results to the year-ago quarter. Our average realized gold price was up 35%, while our operating margin and adjusted net income were up 85% and 122% respectively. In this inflationary environment our costs applicable to sales are only up 6% from the year-ago quarter, which is something we are quite proud about. Looking at our equity gold sales for the quarter by region compared to our 2008 internal budget, we are performing in line with our plans. Our Montreal, Newmont continues to do what we say we are going to do. In Nevada, we sold 554,000 ounces in line with our budget. The story at Yanacocha is the same with equity gold sales of 222,000 ounces with slightly higher production expected in the second half of the year as the tons placed on leach at the end of the second quarter were ahead of plan due to improved mine sequencing. In Australia and New Zealand, gold sales were ahead of budget as we benefited from higher grades at Jundee and Tanami offsetting production shortfalls at Kalgoorlie. At Batu Hijau, sales were below our original expectations due to reduced throughput and recovery. Our team at Batu Hijau was aggressively focused on de-watering the pit, which as previously disclosed, had accumulated an unusually large amount of water from the heavy rains in the first quarter. We are ahead of schedule in our de-watering efforts, improving our chances for slightly higher production in the second half of the year, assuming a normal dry season. At Ahafo in Ghana we sold 134,000 ounces slightly higher than budget as we are seeing higher grades at the Subika and Apensu pits. Looking at cost applicable to sales for each region compared to budget, again we are performing in line with our plans. Our costs in Nevada were slightly higher than budget, primarily due to higher costs for diesel, cyanide, lime and other consumables. The story is essentially the same at Yanacocha in Peru with higher royalties and workers participation due to higher gold prices also adding pressure to operating costs. In Australia and New Zealand, our costs were slightly favorable to budget due to the higher than anticipated production. We continue to feel the pressure of the strengthening Australian currency although higher grades at Jundee and Tanami were helping to offset cost escalation in the region. As of the end of the second quarter, our costs applicable to sales are expected to increase by approximately $3 for every 0.10 change in the Australian dollar exchange rate for the rest of the year. At Batu Hijau the difference between actual and budget is primarily due to the higher commodity prices and lower production volumes. Potentially higher production in the second-half of the year could improve our operating costs for the year if we benefit from a normal dry season. At Ahafo, lower than budgeted costs were the result of higher power availability from the grid versus our assumption of self-generated power and lower labor cost and capitalization of pre-production mining cost. As some of you might be aware, the Volta River Authority in Ghana has proposed an increase in its power tariffs to approximately $0.22 per kilowatt-hour, up from the current rate of approximately $0.10. Our regional management as well as the other Ghanaian mining companies working through the chamber of mines continues to negotiate this rate with the VRA. But as you will see in the next slide, even with the higher rate, we have lowered our cost guidance for the year in Ghana primarily due to higher than anticipated power availability from the VRA versus our assumptions and greater than expected capitalization of the cost of waste rock placed for the construction tails dams and other facilities. As shown in slide seven, compared to our previous guidance, we expect higher production in Australia due to the strong production from Jundee as well as lower cost at Ahafo. Even with a higher assumed oil price for $125 per barrel and an Australian dollar foreign exchange rate of 0.95 for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect full-year operating performance in line with our original guidance. And as further highlighted on slide eight, we are decreasing the low end of our range for consolidated capital expenditure guidance to account for the deferral of capital in Indonesia related to ongoing delays of the renewal of the forest use permit. We are also reducing our range for corporate tax rate to between 22% and 26% from between 28% and 32%. This is due to the benefits of tax restructuring opportunities that we realized during the second quarter. When I became CEO of Newmont slightly over a year ago, I told our employees, our management team, and our shareholders that a new day was dawning at Newmont. Since that time, we renewed our focus on our core gold business, increased our efforts at better planning the business and constantly monitored our execution against our plans. I believe our focus is beginning to pay off. This is the fourth quarter in a row of strong operating and financial results that are solidly within our planned levels of performance. While renewing our focus on planning and execution, we also remain committed to being the leader in safety, sustainability and environmentally responsible practices. We are now the only gold company to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World, and we recently received the GE ecomagination Award in Nevada for reducing water usage and environmental pollutants related to road maintenance on our haul roads. As shown on slide ten, our first priority is getting our operations right. This means fixing what was broken and restoring confidence that we can deliver on our plan. As an example, Leeville is now running as originally planned at full capacity of 3200 tons per day. Our cost management efforts are also starting to take hold. From where we ended 2007 to the midpoint of our corporate 2008 guidance, our cost applicable to sales are expected to increase by about 12%, less than half of the projected industry average of approximately 25%. We also continued to work towards the restoration of our divestiture issues about Hijau. While, certain issues pertaining to divestiture are presently in arbitration, we remain committed to fulfilling the divestiture obligations as defined in the contract of work. We respect the government's decision to resolve these disputed issues through the arbitration process, which is expected to provide clarity on how divestitures should proceed. However, we will not allow this situation to distract us from effectively executing on our plans and managing the other assets in our portfolio. At our Phoenix mine in Nevada, we have completed our revised plan. We indicated a year ago that we would talk with you about this plan now. We must now focus on executing this plan. From the first six months of 2007 to the first six months of 2008 tons mined are 18% higher, gold ounces sold are 9% higher, copper pounds sold are 141% higher and costs applicable to sales are 54% lower. Well, how do we accomplish this, the team in Nevada did a terrific job. They drilled 230 new holes one time and under budget. They redefined the ore body. They got a better understanding of the complex metallurgy. We made changes to our drilling and blasting methods that improve fragmentation and helped increase mining, crushing and milling efficiencies. We made improvements in the mill and we added a new crusher. We're seeing the benefits with year-to-date cost applicable to sales of $378 per ounce. On the next slide you can see a quoting to the revised mining plan at Phoenix. We expect the average annual gold production over the next five years to be between 200,000 ounces and 250,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of between $400 and $500 per ounce based on current commodity prices of $900, gold and $360, copper. These projections do not include any benefits from the copper leach project, which is currently in stage three of our capital effect in this program. This project, if approved, will further reduce Phoenix cost by converting waste material to reserves. We expect to make a development decision on this project in 2009. Moving to project execution, during the second quarter we successfully completed the Yanacocha gold mill and the power plant in Nevada. The gold mill was placed into commercial production on April 1st and the power plant on May 1st. In the next 12 months, our primary focus is on delivering Boddington in Australia, defining our development plans for the Hope Bay deposit and making stage gate decisions on the Conga and Akyem projects. The gold mill at Yanacocha represents the next generation at Yanacocha. For the past 15 years Yanacocha has produced 100% of its gold from leach pads. Now, as we are getting deeper into the ore bodies and into more complex ores, we have added a gold mill to more efficiently continue our production at Yanacocha. The gold mill went into commercial operation on April 1st, ahead of schedule and below our forecasted level of capital expenditures. The transition to operation… from projects to operations went smoothly and the ramp-up was well ahead of expectations. This project is a great example of demonstrating one of the things that differentiates Newmont from a number of its smaller competitors. Across the globe, we have a team with a lot of experience in staring up mills and maintaining mills. Our capital effectiveness project got this project right from the beginning. Peer reviews assured us that we had the right operating conditions assumed and how we were going to run the mill into our capital projects. We had an operational readiness team that made sure that the mill was ready to operate when it was completed. At the mill's ramp-up, we had a combined team of experts from around the world, from Nevada, from Denver, from Ghana, from Australia and from Indonesia. On site, we had experts from around the world to assure a smooth transition from operations… into operations from construction. The power plant in Nevada is another success story, having achieved commercial production on May 1st and now operating at a 100% of design capacity. Final cost of approximately $620 million is at the low end of our forecast and the project was delivered about two months ahead of schedule. This is a 200-megawatt coal-fired plant of which our Nevada operations will consume approximately 130 megawatts. The remaining power will be sold to CR Pacific. In addition to the $120 million we receive annually from our investment in Canadian Oil Sands Trust, this offset further reduces our exposure to high energy and oil prices. The difference between what we were paying to get power from the grid compared to our cost to produce power from our plant will save us approximately $70 million to $80 million per year. With these projects successfully delivered, we are now focused on delivering Boddington in Australia. At the end of the second quarter the project was 77% complete and remains on schedule to start up at the end of 2008 or early 2009. Our current cost estimate of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion to Newmont's account continues to be pressured by the strong Australian dollar and industry-wide labor and commodity cost escalation. We will continue to monitor the impacts of these factors on the capital cost estimate. We will provide another update during our third quarter conference call. Boddington represents the next generation of our production from Australia. Our share reserves is approximately 11 million ounces of gold and 1 billion pounds of copper, a significant exploration upside. We expect annual average production to our account of approximately 650,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold and 45 million to 50 million pounds of copper. This next slide illustrates the depth of our project pipeline and where each projects fits within our stage gate framework. I won't go into detail on each of these products, but I did want to show you that we have several projects at various stages of our evaluation, most of which are gold projects, but we also have some exposure to copper, diamond and iron ore as the slide shows. Not all of these projects will make to the execution stage, but by using a defined, disciplined process the projects that do each execution will have a greater probability of being successfully completed on schedule and within budget and delivering the expected results. We will keep you updated on these projects as they advance through the pipeline. Turning to exploration, the main accomplishment during the past 12 months was our acquisition of the Hope Bay deposit in Canada. We also discovered a new mineralized zone at Callie Deeps near Tanami in Australia and we have further defined Turf a new high-grade exploration target next to Leeville in Nevada. Looking forward, we'll be focused on converting additional non-reserved mineralization at Boddington as the exploration potential there continues to be robust and we've initiated our drilling program at Hope Bay and expect to report non-reserved mineralization in 2009. We'll also be focused on advancing studies on Nassau, our joint venture in Suriname. We're going through those individually in the next slides on Nevada. We continue to focus exploration on the discovery of additional high-grade zones at Leeville and Turf. At Turf our geologist have discovered about twice as much mineralization as we originally predicted based on surface drilling as shown on this cross section. We're currently driving a drift over the top of the target from Leeville where we will continue to drill on 30-meter intervals. We believe there is significant high-grade potential here and the infrastructure at Leeville is already in place. In Australia earlier this year, our geologist discovered a new mineralized zone at Auron and Asok as shown in the cross-section on this slide. Some of the mineralization occurs as free gold and some with sulphides. So, metallurgical testing is in progress with encouraging initial results. The Callie Deeps project was recently advanced to stage 3 and is focused on increasing our reserves at Tanami and developing new processing facilities and infrastructure to reduce operating costs and support a longer mine life. The Nassau project is in Suriname where we are partnered with Alcoa. Newmont is the operator of the joint venture and we currently have a 50% ownership interest, but are earning up to 80%. Nassau is currently in our stage 2, which we expect to be completed by the end of 2008. Today, we've discovered on the order 280 million tons of mineralized rock at about 1 gram per ton gold with 60 million tons to 90 million tons of grades of approximately 1.4 grams to 1.3 grams per ton. The project appears to be minable using open pit mining and simple milling processing methods. We hope to convert some of this target into NRM this year and we'll spend approximately $11 million this year to do so. In Canada, our focus at Hope Bay is on augmenting our project development team, accessing development options, advancing drilling, geotechnical and related stage 2 studies and improving site and camp infrastructure. This year we're spending $30 million for drilling and exploration that is targeting conversion of resources to NRM in 2009. We're also conducting a $40 million stage 2 study that is expected to be completed in 2009. On the financial front in the last 12 months we have eliminated a 100% of your remaining hedge book when gold was trading at approximately $650 per ounce. We monetized our royalty portfolio for $1.3 billion and notably we are approaching completion of our five-year intensive capital reinvestment campaign. We also made the decision to retain our investment in Canadian Oil Sands Trust, which now generates annual cash distributions of $120 million and has an unrealized gain of approximately $1.3 billion and although we can't report the benefits of these distributions there is a credit to our cost applicable to sales. On a cash flow basis the distributions cover approximately 25% of our total oil exposure. Together the cash flows from Canadian Oil Sands Trust and the saving I referred to earlier from the power plant will cover approximately 1.4 million barrels of exposure or approximately 40% of our global annual consumption of diesel. In that context, over the next 12 months, we will continue to focus on delivering gold price leverage to our shareholders. This means staying unhedged on the revenue side and continuing to aggressively manage our operating and capital cost. And finally we will take advantage of having significantly lower capital spending requirements for the next one to three years to generate substantial operating cash flows. Essentially, we are focused on the continued execution of our plans. This next slide illustrates somewhat if-scenarios around our costs applicable to sales, starting from our reported costs applicable to sales for the second quarter of $440 per ounce of gold. If we used our copper revenue as a by-product credit, our costs applicable to sales would decrease to $383 per ounce for the quarter. Taking this a step further, if we reduced our cost by the cash distributions form our investment in Canadian Oil Sands Trust, our cost applicable to sales were dropped to $362 per ounce in the second quarter. You can also see the year-to-date numbers in this slide, showing a net cost of $281 per ounce. Turning to the next slide, we’d like to use the good work of others to accentuate an important point, our superior leverage to gold price on a per share basis. By having full exposure to rising gold prices and executing on our plans, Newmont offers the highest leverage to gold prices per share amongst our peers. In closing, our continued focus on operation and project execution is beginning to pay off. The second quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of successful operating and project execution. We continue to deliver on our plans and we’ve demonstrated our ability to bring new projects on line like the Yanacocha gold mill and the power plant in Nevada. We're the largest unhedged gold company and we see a significant operating cash flow generation from margin expansion. We have a global portfolio of word-class assets with production from five continents and at least one major new project on four of those five continents. This ensures operational flexibility and the opportunity to optimize the total value of our portfolio. And finally, we continue to demonstrate our leadership and sustainability and environmentally responsible practices, which will open doors for Newmont in other areas. With that I would like to thank you all for listening and open it up for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from John Hill. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
John Hill - Citigroup: John Hill, Citigroup. Thanks, good morning and congrats on a strong result to everyone. I was just wondering if we could get a bit more color on Batu Hijau, sounds interesting that you are aggressively pursuing de-watering. There has obviously been some questions about the de-watering shaft, it would be interesting to know whether that is starting up again and as well the impact of any of these... these are practical on the ground impact of the forest permit and waste rock issues?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, couple of answers. First with respect to de-watering, basically we added some pumping capacity, optimized the pumps that we had out there... kept them on line, may be better than we had originally anticipated. We have made no progress on the pit water shaft other than we took it to the end of stage gate 3 and we are going to hold. And we are going to hold until we get the pinjam pakai, because without the pinjam pakai we will not be doing enough pre-stripping to actually utilize the benefits of that pit water shaft for a longer period time to get a payback. So, we continue to wait for the pinjam pakai. There is really been no news on that. And with respect to divestitures, I said we're in arbitration. We really don't have a lot more to say about it. Continued to look at options as we work through this process with the government.
John Hill - Citigroup: Great perspective, great perspective. Just as a follow-up, on Ahafo the capitalized waste rock moving in and mining in such, can we quantify those impacts?
Blake M. Rhodes - Vice President and Chief Counsel: John, Rhodes, it’s about $60 an ounce for the quarter. And that’s…
John Hill - Citigroup: Okay, is that expected to continue for a while?
Blake M. Rhodes - Vice President and Chief Counsel: No, it won’t continue for much long. We were doing some self construction rather than bringing in the contractors. So, we just moved those costs from operating to capital. And that's why you see the reduction despite the increase in power in Ghana for the year or the expected increase at least. It’s about $60, $65 for the quarter.
John Hill - Citigroup: Great. Thanks, Dick. Thank Rhodes, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, our next question is from John Bridges. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: John Bridges, JP Morgan. Hi, Dick and everybody. With the Phoenix new plan, is there a more detailed breakdown of how this thing looks anywhere, will you be publishing that?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thomas, will cover this.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, we are at a stage… this is Russ, sorry, we are at a stage with Phoenix where we had basically taken it. We had taken it out of the management structure, if you want, of Nevada and we're about to roll it back in. Our intent going forward is not to report Phoenix separately. We believe that we, over the last year, have brought the operational on to a level where we are just going to reported it as part of our ongoing business in Nevada. I will say though when you look at the life of [inaudible] at Phoenix which again changes based on metal price assumptions and cost and everything else, we did lose a little bit on the gold side but we picked up at least in equal amounts on the copper side when you look at it from an NAV or a cash flow perspective going forward. So, the nature of Phoenix has changed a little bit from a 80% to 85% gold to somewhere around 60% to 65% gold versus copper and silver on a revenue and NAV basis.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, I'll just add to that that we have given some five-year projections, which we don't normally do, just to give some highlight into what we expect out of Phoenix and then notably I would say that this is a mine that still has, as Russ said, at the current projection of prices somewhere between 20 year and 25 year life. So, this is going to be around with us for a long period of time and we'd be happy to have you all out there and give you some more details at some point.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay. The copper that you expect in the first five years?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: [inaudible]
John Bridges - JP Morgan: How many pounds of copper in the first five years?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: About 20 million a year, and again it varies depending on which parts of the old body. It is not like Batu. It had some higher grade and lower grade zones. So, you see more variability, on a year-in, year-out basis.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay. Just on the side, the power plant is probably one of your higher yielding projects. I seem to remember there was some spare capacity there. Given the potential to make some money there, is there any way of expanding that plant?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, a couple of things. One we do have some excess capacity. But, we're still on CR Pacific grid. So, of the excess capacity, I mentioned, we use about a 130 megs, of the balance about half of that, I think that goes to CR in exchange for the other set of power requirements that we need including black starts [ph], pending reserves, auxiliary power all the rest of that. So, we have about the remaining portion left to sell into the market, which we share with CR Pacific any profits from that. I would say, going forward that if power plants can be built again in Nevada, we do have a site, right next to the one that we have which could certainly have another power plant next to it. We have water and airshed availability there. So, it is something that in the longer term again, if coal plants are environmentally acceptable in the regimes going forward, we could do something there, not in our current plants.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay that's helpful. And then, just looking at the... the move by Barrick follow your lead on buying oil exposure, might they come up with a way of factoring that into the cash cost that might work for you? Is there anything they can do that you can't do because of the Canadian domicile.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, Russ. You'll have to ask Jamie on that one. But from our perspective, just given the lack of the significant correlation between our distributions on CIS and our oil price exposure, again it's a function of their performance prices as well. And net cash flow is coming out. We don't believe we can account for there is an accounting edge, but again, that's part of why we put the slide out really to show the economic edge. It will fit in a other income line versus CIS for us we believe.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay. That's right. And well done guys, pleased to see the progress there.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Victor Flores you may ask your question and please state your company name.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Yes. Hi it's Victor Flores from HSBC. Good morning. My questions go to some of the development stage projects. And I was hoping you could perhaps spend a couple of minutes talking about what some of the key decision or key inputs into the decision-making for the go-ahead on Conga at the end of this year and potentially further work on a team and Hope Bay?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Hi this is Guy Lansdown.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Hello.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: How're you doing?
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Good. How are you?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Good. The process we are busy going through, our team is in stage 2, is currently headed for the gate. It will go through peer review and after that time we'd look at it as a management and decide on what we're going to do going forward, and obliviously report back to folks like yourself towards the end of the year, early next year. But as it relates to team, we're still working on permits and power challenges that we've got out there. On the Conga project, we're busy in stage 3 with engineering and we're looking to complete that towards the end of the year at which time we'd go through the same process of peer-reviewing it, taking it to up to the gate and then making a decision and communicating on that. As far as Hope Bay goes, Dick mentioned we were looking at taking it into NRM or shooting for NRM next year. And so it's such currently in stage 2, we're undergoing drilling programs, metallurgical testing. We're looking at a number of options for optimizing the value of that asset and that would head in towards the gate sometime next year.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: And also mention the revamp of the camp.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Yes, we actually have two programs going on, one is the studies, which is the stage 2 work that I've just mentioned to you. We've also got what we call an infrastructure program. And there we're really setting ourselves up to develop the project from an exploration standpoint, provide infrastructure for better exploring in the area and so that we're in a good position when we do go into project developments. And the type of work that we're doing out there is upgrading the JDs, we're building air strips, we're building roads and we have a camp that we've just put in again to better set ourselves from an infrastructure prospective.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Great, thanks. Could I just ask a follow-up question on two projects? First of all with respect to Conga, other than what we know are increasing capital and operating cost, has there been any major change for the development plan for this project, relative to some of the things that have been said in the past about throughput rates in grades and recoveries and so on?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: At this point there have been no changes to the things like recovery reserves, anything else like that we continue to be on that mine for development.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Yes, we continue to try to optimize it, which is part of the process we're going through at the moment. But yes, apart from escalating cost there is nothing untoward that we see at present.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Victor, it's Russ. At a high-level it's important to realize that even at either in stage 2 and 3, we do spend significant more dollars on these, but internal and external before we taken into gate than we've done it historically. So, when we talk about taking a project to a gate 4 decision, which is essentially full fund approval, we will be at 30% engineering versus historically somewhere around an 8% engineering level. So if you look at that that work is font end loaded into stage two and three. So, while we talk about stage two and three it's a lot more work, there are dedicated teams. For example, as soon goes into stage three a dedicated team is put on them and we do spend significantly more dollars up front that we put at risk. So, while they don't get a full go-decision, we are spending more money than we would have done historically up front putting it at risk. So we have a much better understanding of the project and ultimately what is scheduled and cost will look like.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Fair enough, thanks Russ. And then, just finally on Hope Bay. At what point do you think you'll be in your position or how long will it take to be in a position to get it to I guess, stage 4?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Difficult to tell at the moment because it really depends on permitting and what option we ultimately go for, so we're busy going through the process of analyzing a number of options at present.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Okay, fair enough. Great. Thank you, very much.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Victor.
Operator: Thank you. Oscar Cabrera you may ask your question and please state your company name.
Oscar Cabrera - Goldman Sachs: Yes, Oscar Cabrera, Goldman Sachs. Good morning everyone. Just, I see that you have increased your assumptions in oil prices .We think that context and it is about $35 a barrel increase. We haven't seen changes in the outlook for your cost or CapEx for the year. So, basically two things. First, can you provide a little bit more color as to how are you seeing the cash cost control that you are having? And secondly, what can we expect for CapEx inflation or cost inflation for next year?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: So, Oscar let me start and then Russ can add some color to this. But, first it's important to understand that we went into the year, as I hope you would expect with a conservative view of where we have cost we're going to go. So that's sort of the first pillar [ph] upon which you can say the reason that we were able to absorb some higher oil prices and still keep guidance, because we started with a fairly conservative plan. Second thing is, it's fair to say that with the higher oil price some of our cost are actually going into stock pile and inventory and some of those costs will be realized over the next several years as they come out of inventory into production. And that is a main... that were sub-optimizing here to control costs actually the contrary, means that we are putting the highest grade through as we always do, and some of those other costs will stay in stockpile for a bit. The other thing to note is, around the $8 and some of our other costs, we have been systematically over the last year and half... actually the last year... been putting hedges in place to help produce some of our exposure. With the combination of those three things conservatism, inventory and also just some of our hedging activities that helped us to reduce our operating costs from where we thought we would be. With respect to capital, again we had a capital budget which was probably more aggressive or i.e. conservative in terms of what we spended of, then we probably would otherwise have had coming into the year. When we go through those capital expenditures which we do every month, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize and reduce or defer as is the case that Batu Hijau and using our capital effectiveness process to offset some of the embedded inflation. Now, we have said previously of Boddington earlier this year that we did revise of our estimates for Boddington based on higher inflation and escalation, so we have already done that on the project. With respect to the other two projects, we completed a power plant and the gold mill. Luckily, I think we ordered material, we got people on the ground, we were ahead of schedule on both of those projects, ahead of the schedule of higher inflation anyway. And I think we realize benefits by getting those projects done in a little earlier timeframe. Guy or Russ would you add to that?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Oscar just to your last question, I’d say industry wide we are seeing sort of 15% to 25% CapEx inflation annually, and again that's a function of which region you are in. I will say though that, as I mentioned to Victor earlier, we do a... form of rigorous job in the early stage in the Stage-Gate process to stimulate scenarios for capital costs. So, we build in that contingency up fronts, which has served as well as [inaudible] said a little more conservative approach to capital. One other aspect on operating costs that shouldn't be noticed is, we do produce a bit of silver particularly down in Peru and in Nevada and the higher silver prices has helped to offset some of those cost pressures on the CIS side, whether is [inaudible] diesel for that matters. So, we do see some by-product kicking, and particularly in Phoenix the numbers you saw do reflect obviously a higher copper price year-on-year.
Oscar Cabrera - Goldman Sachs: That's of course a great answer, thank you. Then, you said one more... in terms of your tax rate, it seems the original guidance at the beginning of the year was between 30% and 34%, were at 22% and 26%. Can you talk about what's impacting that and what should we be looking forward next year going forward? Thanks.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Sure. I'm going to have David Gutierrez, our VP of Tax and Accounting to take you through that.
David Gutierrez - Vice President, Tax and Accounting: Yes, in the second quarter based upon our continuing process to simplify our worldwide corporate structure, we will convert a Canadian collaboration to U.S. partnership for U.S. tax law purposes. That generated capital loss what you see for the quarter have given us a fairly low effective tax rate. As that tax rate... as that capital loss could flow it in throughout the whole year, we believe our effective tax rate will be between 22% and 26% for the year. The other reason you're seeing a low rate tool is, because of the high gold prices for depletion purposes in the U.S. we're getting much larger amount of depletion than we otherwise budgeted for.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: And Oscar, just on a go-forward basis somewhere around 30% to 32% is a good number to use. And also just turn back to the second quarter adjustment. This isn't just the defeated text adjustment, we will see approximately $150 million in cash, about $60 million this year and $90 million next year through the tax restructuring that Dave Gutierrez and his team led. So, that was a once off event if you want in the second quarter that's what we backed it out on our earning schedule from the GAAP reported number to the normalized number, if you want. But it is cash, and again look for somewhere between 30% and 32% on a long-term basis, that's good.
Oscar Cabrera - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from John Tumazos. You may ask you question and please state your company name.
John Tumazos - Very Independent Research, LLC: John Tumazos. John Tumazos, Very Independent Research. Could you give an update on the drilling in the Hope Bay District to occur this year and that specifically about how many of the holes are intended to be confirmatory to verify the Miramar resources and how many of the holes are new ground to explore and expand resources. And any other details would you provide for us?
Stephen Enders - Vice President of Worldwide Exploration: Yes, John, this is Steve Enders. The main purpose of the drilling really over the next year, which we say between the start of this year towards the middle of next year. It's focused on two things. The [inaudible] technical aspects that we need to do to confirm project parameters around the design for the pits and the copper dams that may be needed. So, that's a big component of the drilling that's going on right now is to support stage 2 study. The rest of the drilling is really focused on infill and step out from a known resources at Dores [ph] and Madrid and Boston to support the work we have to do around modeling and mine planning to be able to declare non-reserve mineralization at the end of stage 2. That's a lot of work actually between now and sometime in the middle of next year. There is work that's going on in exploration around the district, but it's really a much smaller amount as we focus on the core assets, but in the meantime what we are doing is additional geologic studies to determine what those other targets are so that in due course we explore those in a way that is effectively fits into the project.
John Tumazos - Very Independent Research, LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Chidley. You may ask a question and please state your company name.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Yes, hi, it's Patrick Chidely with Barnard Jacbobs Mellet. Just a question about Boddington, I wonder if you could maybe give us a bit more detail on... just an update on what the plan is in terms of tonnage throughputs and strip ratios etcetera some more detail that would be good.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Patrick, Russ, could you repeat the question, we just missed the last half of it.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Sorry, just wanted to get some more detail on the Boddington projects in terms of strip ratios and how much tonnage and throughput to produce that, and also what the copper credit might be in terms of your percentage copper that you'll be putting through in the first couple of years?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Hi, this is Guy Lansdown again. As far as throughput goes the plants are designed for round about 35 million ton per annum, but as you'd run up on a big plant like this is actually a one-year ramp-up period to achieve full production. I think that answers part of your question and the other one what is the strip ratio we are looking at around 1.3 to 1.5 to 1, strip ratio, we gave the gold and copper production figures, we're looking at I think 650,000 to 700,000 ounces per annum for the first five years. And I'll remind that there is a one year ramp-up and that is on an equity-basis. So we are not going to achieve that in the first year but that's what we anticipate to achieve over the first five years.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: Right and I think the copper grade average is about 1.11% there is... is that likely to be the same in the first two years or higher?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: It's of that order, you are in the right ballpark, it will vary some but that's sort of the ballpark we are looking at.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Copper about 30,000 tons a year on a 100% basis.
Patrick Chidley - Barnard Jacobs Mellet: And I guess, that's just about does that, I mean, all questions have been answered. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Ortsland. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
Terence Ortsland - TSO & Associates: Thanks, Terence Ortsland, TSO & Associates. Given the magnitude of the investment and also the skilled operations and some of the previous history of Yanacocha you think is there any room or leverage to negotiate a long-range social and may be investment agreement per se, try to isolate some of the future uncertainties because you'll be entering a new phase and I think your thing started very nicely but then kind of deteriorated a couple of years ago. So, that's the question?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Terry, the question if I believe I understood correctly, was it Yanacocha a long-term stabilization agreement.
Terence Ortsland - TSO & Associates: Yes, in the sense of you can, revisit all issues of the area, the talent and expectations and all in the kind of the anticipated the uncertainty because more money got to go in there, it's going to be different for the scale of operations and as well as different costs.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, so let try at to answer that just a big picture. We have been in Yanacocha for 15 years, we successfully worked our way through a number of issues with the community. Some of those issues of our own creation quite frankly, what we see today is Yanacocha which is absolutely involved in the community and trying to do the right things to continue the development at the right pace making sure that we constantly look at how we are interfacing with the community. And as an example of that earlier this year, the President of Peru was on site at Yanacocha and he was there to new dedicated facility that we had put in place where we mined a pit and are collecting water during the rainy part of the year and provisioning that water through existing canal systems to the farmers in the area. And the President was basically suggesting to the community as well as the broader Peruvian community that, mining was a valuable part of the economy in Peru, that so long as the mining companies do their jobs in environmentally and socially responsible ways, that we will continue to have a license and in his administration he intended to see mining growing its contribution to the Peruvian economy. So, I think the fact that the President was onsite, the President was supportive of what we're doing, the community is supportive. Year round provisioning of water for the first time in many of these people's lifetime allow them to produce more goods and services and sell those into the market. And I think as result of that we are valued member of the community. What will that will do for us going forward, hopefully it will allow us to move, although in a slightly different district, we will be able to move forward on Conga and I think we will continue to be contributing member in Peru of the economy for a long time to come.
Terence Ortsland - TSO & Associates: That's a good answer. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian MacArthur. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Brian MacArthur, UBS. I just want to come back to Phoenix for a minute, you made a statement about the value on an NAV basis changing from 80% to 85% gold and 60% to 65% copper. Can you... and you given a 200,000 ounces to 250,000 ounces of gold production for the first five years. Can I just have the copper prices and production that you have done to come up with those statements?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah Brian, I think on an NAV basis we were running 900 and 360 and 17-odd silver, just a.. when we revised the project with our Board yesterday, those are the numbers which we base the relative contribution. So, it will move with that.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: And... Sorry just the copper production for the first five years?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: It averages about 20 Brian.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: 20?
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: 20 million pounds.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Great. Thanks very much.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you and our final question today is from John Duddy [ph]. You may ask your question and please state your company name.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks and congratulations on a good quarter guys, this is John Duddy a gold stock analyst. I want to congratulate you on giving more color to the copper production and just by the questions on the call other people like it too. I'm a little bit confused always how you're going to be reporting going forward, it appears that Phoenix is now being reported as a by-product but if I had to eat you, and I'm not sure how you are going to do Boddington. Is that going to be on a co-product basis?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: John, Russ, I will answer the question. Basically the rule of thumb, and it's not co-defined in GAAP, but it's an understanding with the SEC, when your by-product revenue is more than 10% you will generally go to a co-product type of accounting. So when you look at bar two, it's roughly two-third copper, one-third gold with co-product. In Nevada, we treat Phoenix as part of the overall Nevada operation, and the copper production relative to the roughly 2 million ounces in Nevada is de minimis and we show it as a by-product along with silver in Nevada. In Boddington depending on your assumption is about a 10% copper credit, again based on your long-term assumptions and we will be reporting it next until we'll treat copper as a by-product down there. So, what we really have to look at John and when we decide how our accounting is a relative contribution, if its de minimis which is roughly 10% of revenue, we treated it as a by-product. If it's more will go to co-product accounting.
Unidentified Analyst: And so what kind of detail will you be giving us going forward on?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: At which operation?
Unidentified Analyst: [inaudible].
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Yes, in Nevada we will show it net but you will see a net CIA in, Batu you will get both gold and copper. So you will have a $0.01 per pound and a $1 per ounce and in Boddington you'll get a $1 per ounce which will be net of the silver, copper and any molybdenum down the road.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. That helps.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Thanks, John.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Richard O’Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Right. Thank you, very much for your attention on the call today and the last thing I would like to say for any Newmont employees who are on the phone, we truly appreciate your contribution throughout the last year as we have moved the company forward. You all have done a great job, thanks. Keep it up. And thanks to all the analysts out there and holders of the stock. We continue to focus on doing what we say we are going to do and we will tell you more about that in the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the Newmont Mining Cooperation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you any objection you may disconnect at this time. Now I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may begin.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you operator. Good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us today in our first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me today on the call are several members of Newmont's management team who will be available for questions at the end of the presentation. Before we get started, I need to remind you that we'll be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks certain of which are unique to our industry as described in our SEC filing. On slide 3 you can see the quarter highlights. In July of 2007 a new management team took charge of Newmont. We wasted no time in demonstrating our commitment to improving our business results and focus by making several key decisions. The results of these decisions are evident this quarter in our financial operational and project execution results. Execution on our turnaround plans is leading to the intended results. We still have much work to do that we are very pleased with these results and believe they suggest that the efforts of our management and dedicated employees are yielding sustainable improvements in our business. In July of 2007, we eliminated our gold hedges. In the first quarter of this year, we realized a record goal price of $933 per ounce. The buyout of our hedge book positioned Newmont to take full advantage of the current gold bull market. Had we not taken that action, we would have had to deliver in 2008 approximately a million ounces at $384 per ounce. This move has clearly provided value for our shareholders. The higher effective gold price in the quarter combined with equity gold production of almost 1.3 million ounces led to record quarterly revenues of $1.94 billion. Last year we also committed to an ongoing focus on reducing operating costs and increasing our global efficiency and effectiveness. In the first quarter of this year, our costs applicable to sales were $396 per ounce, down 2% from the first quarter of 2007, and well within our plans for the quarter. Our results for the quarter are in stark contrast to be industry trends over the last two years, as reflected in the most recent GFMS gold survey, which shows 2007 total cash costs up almost 25% from 2006. We are committed to continuing to contain our profile at all levels of the company. In July of last year we suggested to shareholders that we intended to smooth out our production profile over the year rather than relying on our historical fourth quarter production push. In the first quarter of this year our production is about one quarter of our production estimate for the full year. While we are not suggesting that our production will occur straight line over the year we do anticipate less reliance on that big production push in the fourth quarter as historically been the case at Newmont. Quarter-to-quarter production shifts will still result from the timing of the Nevada's annual mill maintenance in the second quarter of the year, the seasonal impacts of weather particularly at Batu Hijau and Yanacocha, and of course the usual fluctuations driven by stripping a grate. And at the margin line for the quarter the benefit of our cost containment efforts and higher commodity prices generated the gold operating margin of $537 per ounce, up significantly from the first quarter of 2007. Our efforts to arrest the operating cost inflation combined with favorable gold prices have dropped right to the bottom line, true [ph] gold leverage, as we realized and adjusted net income of $386 million or $0.85 per share, substantially outperforming the consensus of $0.54 per share and an increase of 865% from a year ago quarter. As the final line on this slide shows the true bottom line, we delivered almost $600 million of cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter, as a result of higher effective gold prices, production in line with our forecast and an improved operating cost profile. Two related strategic decisions in 2007 while not leading to immediate financial results, which show up in the first quarter of this year, on this slide do continue to provide us with the necessary gold focus and an improved project pipeline. As previously reported we monetized our royalty portfolio raising about $1.3 billion and almost simultaneously acquired Miramar in the end of the year. We completed the minority interest acquisition of Miramar in March of this year giving us control of world class Hope Bay deposit in the AAA rate country Canada. Moving to the next slide, this slide graphically demonstrates some of the points that I just made. You can see on the top left, average realized prize up almost 44%, cost applicable to sale down almost 2% resulting in an operating margin increase of almost 119%. As a wrap on this slide I would note that we believe that Newmont offers the highest leverage to operating margin per share of any gold company, realizing the midpoint of our production guidance and CAS for the year a $100 change in the gold price increases our pretax margin by approximately $1.15 per share, again we believe more than any other gold company. Moving to the next slide you can see the continuing improvements in the third and fourth quarters of last year as well as this year. As a result our renewed focus across our operating businesses with gold and copper production generally exceeding market estimates and an improving cost applicable to sale. The decisions we made in our improved operating results in the last half of 2007 have clearly provided momentum carrying us into 2008 and our operational and project execution efforts are beginning to pay real tangible rewards, as clearly evidenced by our strong first quarter operating results, and as I'll come to in a minute, our successful project execution efforts in what is probably the most challenging project environment ever. With that, let me turn over to Russell Ball, our CFO for a couple of comments on the next few slides.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Richard, good morning. For those who haven't had a chance to take a look we did file our 10-Q last night and there is a lot of detailed information and I'll try and focus on the highlights of the equity sales for the quarter with a brief look at the full costs for the year and CAS for the quarter as well. We'll be using the same format we started in Q3 where we will compare in green on slide six the actual results what was in our budget and in for the quarter in gold and blue being our guidance for the year. Starting in Nevada you will see equity sales slightly below budget but there was obviously a timing issue with a significant inventory build that put production right in line for the quarter. I would like to comment on Phoenix briefly. For the quarter Phoenix produced gold at $401 an ounce significantly below our prior year numbers and in fact, our budget which was roughly $545 an ounce for the quarter. So we continue to see solid progress. Clearly the work is not done, but we have had 2 months in February and March where we exceeded a million tons milled. We still are dealing with some recovery issues, but we are feeling more and more confident about the direction in which Phoenix is headed. At Yanacocha, we were slightly ahead of budget, partly due to the inventory drawdown again we sat on some inventory, fourth quarter last year as we spoke to on the year end call about. We didn't place the ounces in the fourth quarter and early into the first quarter as we have seen a shift in production at Yanacocha to the second half of the year which does increase our risks slightly. On the positive side as Dick will speak to later, the gold mill was actually turning in the first quarter and that ramp up is going well. So we will production from that, we expect commercial production in Q2. In Australia you can see we were significantly ahead of budget driven by some excellent grades and operating results at the Jundee operations in Australia. But it hit you again slightly ahead of budget largely due to inventory drawdown from year-end. Dick will speak to you in a little bit on the issues we face because as we look at our guidance for the year Batu Hijau really represents the biggest risk that we see today and we'll provide some color on that later on the slides. Ghana, you will see was about 30,000 ounces, below budget. A couple of factors, there was some unplanned mill maintenance and we continue to see power interruptions in Ghana. The power issues are clearly not behind us and we did have some unscheduled downtime as a result of that. We expect to be caught up all but 15 to 20 ounces of that shortfall by year-end as the management team has put in a mitigation plan. Turning to slide 7, cost applicable to sale, you'll see for the quarter we were at 396. We are maintaining our guidance for the year at 425 to 450. I'll speak to that in a second but looking at Nevada you'll see costs largely in line, again a solid quarter from Phoenix versus our expectations. And as Dick will speak to in a little bit we should see some benefit from power plant which will be hopefully in commercial production by the end of the quarter. Yanacocha just continues to deliver in line with the numbers that they have committed. Australia again driven by Jundee with a significantly lower CAS versus what we had in the budget driven largely by higher grades and production. We do however continue to struggle at KCGM and for those who are looking to the derails you'll see we were in excess of $750 an ounce for the quarter. At Batu Hijau, higher cost, a function of some stripping and lower production, again sales a little higher than what we had a expected but that was largely due to timing of inventory. And as I mentioned early this really represents the biggest risk to us for the year. Ghana costs were down largely due to lower stripping and some vacancies that haven't been filled. If you look at our full cost for the year at 425 to 450 it's important to realize that when we put out initial guidance we had assume a $700 gold price. In this roughly 900 gold price environment we do see cost pressure resulting from increased royalties, workers' participation and the like that will be about $10 to $15 dollar higher. We are also in a $115 oil environment versus 80 in our original budget prepared last October, and the full cost assumption of $90 for the first quarter full costs. So we do have some exposure there. On the Aussie dollars we are starting to hedge our exposure to the Aussie dollar but again we had budgeted at $0.875 and we are in a roughly AUD $0.95. Again in our earnings release we've provided the sensitivity to those. So you can pick your oil price in Aussie dollar and get a pretty good idea of the impact on our CAS. On the positive side the higher commodity prices have resulted in us seeing better byproduct credits in particular proper at Phoenix and Nevada, and silver largely from our Midas operation in Nevada and in Yanacocha. So we... as Dick said we have a keen focus on costs, but clearly inflationary pressures are there but we have plans in place to mitigate that, and we still feel comfortable with our original guidance of 425 to 450 an ounce,
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Russell. Moving to the next slide, our major projects update. As you all know we are seeing across the industry continued cost escalation and scheduled extensions on major projects. Guy Lansdown, our senior Vice President of project development and technical services and his team are working hard everyday to continually manage our major projects, and several minor projects as well. This slide provides a brief update on our three major capital projects. As you can see the power plant in Nevada began commissioning work in Q1 of 2008. It's about 87% complete at the end of the first quarter, and should be fully operational in the second quarter. First, fire on oil and first fire on coal were both ahead of schedule went well and we continue to anticipate an on or before time delivery this project. Projected annual savings to Nevada will be approximately $60 million or about $25 per ounce. Of course that depends on production levels. So this project is going very well, in the project execution and turning it over to project operational phase and we are very hopeful that it will lead to ongoing cost savings in Nevada. Second project, the gold mill in Peru is already ramping up. We were down there a few weeks ago and the mill is operating as expected. As we ramp it up, we still anticipate commercial operations in the second quarter, higher recoveries from the mill compared to the leach pad, expected to add between 100 to 150,000 ounces of gold annually to Yanacocha's production. This project will be delivered on schedule and remains on budget with capital costs of $250 million to $270 million. And finally Boddington in Australia continues to advance although we've had to work hard everyday to keep the project on schedule and within our current capital guidance of between $1.4 million and $1.6 billion to our account... our share. We continue to expect the project to start up in late 2008 or early 2009, and as we have indicated previously when fully operational this will be the largest gold operation in Australia with our share of production between 650 and 700 ounces of gold, 700000 ounces of gold, our cost applicable to sales in the low to mid 300 per ounce. Moving to the next slide our advanced projects update. I mentioned earlier we completed the acquisition of Miramar on March 17th and we now have control one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world. We are actively investing and updating the current infrastructure to accommodate a more aggressive exploration program planned for this year and beyond as we try to move the resource designation into our NRM. We're excited about this asset and we'll continue to keep you updated as the project advances through advanced exploration and into our capital effectiveness program and comes out with a project feasibility study as early as late this year or the first part of next year and we will continue to work on that project and keep you updated. Conga in Peru is now stage three of our capital effectiveness program. That reserves if you know to account current stand at 6.1 million ounces of gold and about 1.7 billion tons of copper. We continue with our evaluation process and optimization process around the development of this project. Continue to build on our relationships within the community. We continue to work with our contractor on making sure we have the best development plans that we can come up with. And we anticipate a development decision on this project by the end of the year. And with respective to Akyem in Ghana the only new news that we have filed with and the Ghanaian EPA has accepted of our submittal of a revised draft environment impact study that was completed on April 23, 2008. That permitting process continues and again we expect and hope that we can make a development decision on this project at the end of the year as well. In addition to completing three major capital projects, the power plant, gold mill in Boddington next early this... late this year early next year, we have an exciting pipeline of advanced projects that represent the next generation of our major capital projects and the next generation of our production. As Russ indicated moving to the next side on Batu Hijau we have revised our 2008 production guidance downward slightly at Batu Hijau. This slide provides the explanation for that revision. Higher than forecasted rainfall, in fact, rainfall well above the P90 levels will impact our production during the remaining portion of the year. As you can see from the chart on the right, the red line represents the cumulative P50 rainfall in the pit area and the blue shaded area is the actual amount of rainfall. At these levels we'll spend more time pumping water out of the pit we have been with less production time during the dry season at the bottom of the pit. Additionally this year we were impacted by the fact that we were not able to secure the renewal of our forestry permit and because of that we had to divert additional water into the pit. There has been some minor damage to the pit infrastructure sloughing due to water and as a result of that, we'll have some more time in the bottom of the pit to clean out the remains of that sloughing that has occurred at the bottom of the pit. So production will really be impacted by the extent of the dry season access that we have in the second half of 2008. Notably as we indicated in our press release potential production shortfall due to restricted access in 2008 are expected to be recovered in 2009. And you can see the revised guidance for Batu Hijau with respect to both gold sales and copper sales at the bottom of slide 10. Moving on to slide 11 with respect to divestiture, one piece of news on this and that's really in the third bullet point where you can see that with the divestiture process continues in parallel with the arbitration process we have offered under the terms of the contract of work 7% this is what we referred to as 2008 vantage 7%, for $426 million or at the 100% level at $6.1 billion valuation for our investment in Batu Hijau and a long contract of work. I would say that with respect to international arbitration, both for government and Newmont continue to follow the contract of work in each of the areas and we continue to work forward on the arbitration process, both of us having appointed our arbiters and the process continues and we will work expeditiously to get to the result that we both feel is there. So in closing, moving to slide 12, this quarter reflects strongly our management's commitment to do what we say we are going to do. We said in 2007 that if we were gold company we should provide exposure to gold price, outside off the hedges you can see the impact of that. We said we needed to further focus on cost, you can see the cost improvement profile in the business over the last three quarters. We said we have to successfully execute on our project pipeline, as you have heard, on both the Power Plant and Yanacocha Gold Mills, we are delivering at or in front of our schedule and at or below the projected cost. We still have challenges in delivering on Boddington, which we will continue to keep you updated on, but I can assure you the Guy Lansdown and his team are absolutely focused on bringing this project in the best way possible in what is, as I mentioned before, a very competitive environmental project. All of that means that we are on plan for what we need to do. We also know that our plans had to be sustainable, that we have to be committed every day to our results and that one quarter doesn't make a successful turnaround. We now have three quarters in a row that we are hedged down, focused on execution and if we continue to successful in that we do believe shareholders value will increase. And we would encourage to continue to hold your investment in what we believe is the highly leveraged... the most highly leveraged gold investment that you can make. Thanks for your attention and we will take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Hill.
John Hill - Citigroup Smith Barney: Thank you, good morning and congratulations on a strong result. It must be great to see all the hard work staring to pay off?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: It is, thank you, John. I appreciate that.
John Hill - Citigroup Smith Barney: Obviously, there were something that went you way in the quarter, thinks like inventory draw down and price participation, but it seems like you get some positives coming in the back part of the year with the new Mill at Yanacocha, way though... doesn't that make the swing operations, the really key ones, in other words maintain that performance at Phoenix and in Ghana, so that we can really benefit from the new Mill later in the year. How confident are you that we can sustain this kind of results in these operations, which have been challenging but look somewhat better here?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well as Russ, indicated at Phoenix, we had a good quarter at Phoenix, but again a good quarter doesn't necessarily say that we got this so we turned around. I would tell you, as we said at our analyst meeting as we said last year, we are focus on delivering the mine plan at Phoenix mid-year, so we will give an update in July when we next release earnings and this tell you how we really feel about Phoenix. What I will tell is that Brant Hinze has led a tremendous effort over there, in Nevada, not just at Phoenix, but across the Nevada operation. His team at Phoenix has being clearly focused on delivering through operating results, high melt throughput that we had to-date. The team is really focused on recoveries. We have finished all the drawing that we need to do at Phoenix and I think we will see some sustain improvement at Phoenix, again we'll communicate those results later in the year. But across the Nevada operation, Brant and his team are really doing and excellent job of really leveraging the portfolio, looking for areas of improvement, so it's not just Phoenix, it is all of the operations at Nevada that have to deliver and I think Brant and his team are committed to doing that. With respect to Ghana, clearly, power availability will continue to effect our performance over there. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy the power plant that we imported and have built over there, we hope that over the next period, that the government and Newmont can continue to work on ways to allocate power appropriately and we have just seen some infrastructure investment which hopefully will allow some of these power strikes that we had to endure in the first quarter to go away. So I hope John, that as you said, the outright production from Ghana, the production from not just Phoenix, but not all of Nevada will be in line and we will continue to be able to benefit from those improvements that we see from the other operations.
John Hill - Citigroup Smith Barney: Great, great prospective and just a quick follow up, do you... at current gold prices see the company being cash flow neutral on go forward basis or do you still see cash capacity for year as being subject that needs to be addressed.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: At these Gold prices, John we will be cash flow positive for the year, net Cash flow positive for the year.
John Hill - Citigroup Smith Barney: Great, thank you.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from John Bridges.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Hi, Dick, everybody.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey, John.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Well done with the progress. Just wonder, what happened with Ahafo, just wonder what's conspired to give you grief there.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Couple of things, I will do one and Russ can talk about it as well, but we had a mill motor that went down in the first or second week of the quarter and it took us a little bit of time to get a repairer in there, and that just took... took some time for us to give the inventory through the mill once we got it up and operating. Also we had some power spikes Russ you want to say some more.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That was it, John and we had some issues with the gear box, we do have some warranty claims in but the warranty claim doesn't get that production back, so we repaired the box and, we have used some of the material that we have on site for Alkem as a short term plug if you want and we are back ordering that, but that's all behind us as Dick said, the biggest issue quite frankly was an additional transmission line, that was put in so we now have a back up or redundancy in the transmission line into the plant from the grid which really is only coming up, I guess its still coming up in April, which is going to make a big difference. The up and down is what causes those big gears, gear boxes to really have a problem, once they get up and running, they are fine, it's the stop start on an unplanned basis that just causes high maintenance issues.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's bit about luck because the Ghanaian operation, Jeff Huspeni, our Regional Vice President over there, Trent Temple the operating guy over there have really done a good job of just continuing to deliver over there and there was bit about luck, I think without that, we clearly would be on plan and they have every expectations to get those ounces back, if we don't get them all back this year they will be available next year.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay, any update on Phoenix, there is a study that was going on, I believe you are going to have some output from that, about now.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, again John, I think we will be prepared to talk about that in July, this year we will have on the earnings call, mine plan should be complete. It's on schedule to be available then, again good results for the quarter, we just got to get the mine plan out there.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay, great, congratulation again on the progress, and good luck, guys.
Operator: Victor Flores, you may ask your question.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could give us a bit of more detail on how you see the ramp up at Yanacocha progressing throughout the year. Just looking at what you have achieved already in the first quarter, unfortunately paints a rather ugly picture for the rest of the year, given higher, much higher costs and lower production. Yes, you have the mill coming on stream. I was hoping you could perhaps give us a bit more of an idea how you expect production and cost to perform throughout the year?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I will just say Victor, remember that this is not a quarter-to-quarter business as we described in our 10-Q, Yanacocha this year expect its production to actually be back end loaded, they have got some stripping that they are in to the first quarter of this year. They didn't get as much down on the leach pads in the first quarter as they will throughout the balance for the year and really the mill is going to be an additional, and it is as we said on schedule, so should provide additional production towards the end of the year. So at this point with our plans we see we are just where we expected to be at Yanacocha.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah Victor, Russ, just in particular on the ramp-up, the ramp-up is going well. We are slightly ahead of our curve that we had plotted to get it into commercial production. We have had the usual start up and teething issues, but the team is quietly confident that they will deliver at least what they said in the budget, despite a couple of weeks delay in actually getting the mill turning, and the ramp up is going very well. We have people from a number of Newmont operations around the world, quite frankly that have gone in on a short term basis to assist with that ramp up. So it is going very well and it's really testimony to the efforts of Tim Hackney and the projects group down there that this project is being delivered in the fashion it is.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Can you give us a sense at this point as to how many tons you expect to process from the mill, say in the second half and roughly sort of grades and recoveries of --.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's a little early for that, but we will commit to provide that you on the second quarter call along with Phoenix. We are still ramping up we were about 30% to 40% by the end of March, so it's still too early really to tie that down, but we'll definitely give that you in the Q2 call.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Or we will ask the guys on the site visit.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: You are welcome.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: All right, great. Second question goes to Leeville, I was reading through the Q and it looks like tonnage has improved a quite a bit relatively, at least to a year ago. Can you just give us a sense of how you see that operation performing, going forward.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, again, I think a tribute to Brant and his team over there, they have got the back fill situations going the back fill plants are operational, really were at the end of the year. We are really starting to see as a result to the ramp up through 2007, the careful and expected ramp up of Leeville, but we are now in the operational phase of really being able to get after what we see at Phoenix. So we continue to see great levels that are at or above what we expected, tonnage movements underground are going well and we're actually getting very comfortable with the backfield methodology and being able to move too in our drifting programs in a very acceptable way. So at this point it's really going pretty well.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Victor, I would like to add Brant's team has done a good job getting underground workers trained up and we are transitioning contractors out and transitioning that to employees which obviously is going to impact positively on the cost structure and then some interesting explorations results, quite frankly just outside of Leeville toward the turf deposit that you may remember from one of your visits out there. It's starting to show some interesting results. So we're excited quite frankly in that the direction which Leeville's headed.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Great. Thanks. That was going to be another sort of follow up, which was, you have sorted out the infrastructure but the labor issues sound like are those are getting sorted as well.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah and this goes back to a program Brant started over two years ago, to really put a number of resources into the training department and reinvigorate that effort, but again it's a long lead time to get people trained up, but we are starting to see the benefits of that and will continue to see this move from contractors to employees.
Victor Flores - HSBC Securities: Great, thank, thank you very much.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks Victor.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian MacArthur
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Good morning, just reading through the Q, I was wondering if you can clarify this, you mentioned in your presentation that permit you have to get for by June of this year and its sound like you sort of think you get it, but exactly what has to go on there and how that could impact things in Batu Hijau?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so this relates to our pinjam pakai, Brian is the forestry permit that we need to disturb pregrowth in the area and really its more about the maintenance of water and erosion, then it is about cutting the trees. But we have a permit actually, that we secured early in the life of the operation. That permit came up... is supposed to come up every five years for renewal, it has come up in 2005 and we have been working on but just have not received renewal that we need at this time. With that, we are in a position where we can't cut trees, we can't disturb areas where we actually need to expand the waste dump, as a result of that we are in a position where we once had water go in to the pit because we weren't able to divert in and around, in back into the jungle, we had take the water and put it into the pit. Secondly if you don't get the permit in a reasonable amount of time, we will be in a position where we probably have to lay off some employees and shut down some trucks and as a result of that have changed the longer term nature of the plan, we don't have the full impact of what that would do to the life of mine, but in the next few years we really don't anticipate a big change in production. We are working very closely with the Indonesian government at all levels and we do hope that we will be able to secure the permit here and in the next little bit. If we don't get it early in the dry season, there will be some other impacts as we are working at several projects over there, that would take a longer term commitment towards having the pinjam pakai and those projects relate to both the third sag mill at Batu Hijau as well as a pit water tunnel that we are working on to... a pit water shaft to try to remove water in a more efficient way. So that's those couple of things that really going to be combined here and Russel Ball and myself, our Associate General Counsel Blake Rhode and we have all spent time over there working on this permit as well as continue day-by-day up with our Indonesian office. All I can tell you is I think we get support at all levels of the government, and we are hopeful that we are going to get it soon.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Okay and may be just another question, just for Batu, you have now got a third tranch to parts of the Indonesian government, is this new tranch storing to the same potential buyers as the other today two previous tranches that all have different valuation methods, or I mean could you are just moving up the date, you got three separate valuations, three different points in time, you have got three different parties here that are all negotiating or how does that all tie together now.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Brian, Russ, the 3% from those 6 to 7% from '07 those are the one subject to arbitration
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Right.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have identified parties that have expressed an interest in regards to the '08, 7% at the 6.1 billion 100% valuation. We received notification from the Indonesian government that they intended to excise their right of first refusal on that and acquire the shares. However they have not provided us with which branch of government would be buyer. So we are working through that process as we speak.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Okay, so the first two that there are all set up you have two parties you just debate how you are going to do it, you debate price, you debate how you pay it. Well as this ones kind of further behind in the process.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, and got to the phase II, the price is fixed at the109 and the-- what is it, 286 for the 3% and the 7% respectively.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Right.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We still are debating who the buyers of those would be, and again that's really the gist of the arbitration.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Right.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In regards to the 7% from '08, the government has clearly said within the thirty day period that they intend to exercise their right, however we don't know which particular arm of the government will acquire the shares, but they have indicated that they will be acquiring and we still need to finalize the valuation for those shares.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Warburg: Okay, great thanks very much.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: The next question is from Oscar Cabrera
Oscar Cabrera - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, gentleman, congratulations on the stronger sales, just following up on Brian's question on Batu Hijau, so just to let me understand, if you don't receive this permit in June then this would get delayed but in case you do receive it, how long you think it would take for you to complete the pumping system or the tunnel system, so that you don't have the same occurrence if you has same amount of rain next year, is this a 12 month project, or is it more than that.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is actually, a couple of projects Oscar, if we get the pinjam pakai in relatively short order, we can go in and do the dry season work this year and mitigate a lot of the impact by getting that in order at or around the pit. The pit water tunnel is a two year project and as Dick alluded to is a roughly $50 million to $70 million for the first phase project, but that would take two years to get that out. But the water tunnel has let us pump from the bottom as opposed to have the pump out at the ramp and have to move the parts in the pumping system as the pit develops, so its really an efficiency which will give us more time in the pit and reduce cost to reduce that water. So there's really two different projects. One, the pit water tunnel which is the long term solution, short term we have put additional resources to get the pumping out. The issue for us quite frankly and the rainy season has just ended. We are pumping that the draw down slightly ahead of where we expect it will be. The issue is really when the next wet season starts. And the wet season in Indonesia, at least on Batu is roughly October 15th. So if the wet season is little late, we would actually be able to get into the bottom of the pit and get a lot of that production back. If the wet season starts early, we will just have a much shorter time in the bottom of the pit. The key issue is that the ounces aren't lost, the ounces and the pounds aren't lost, we will just go back next year and get them, but they would be pushed out from '08 into '09.
Oscar Cabrera - Goldman Sachs: All right.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: The other piece of pinjam pakai as Russell mentioned is really timed to established the waste dump for future waste that comes out of the pit, if we don't get that, we will just have to figure out whether we actually move into a stripping program for phase 6 or whether we just go, forget the stripping program and go for production and delay the stripping to a later date. So we have a lot of flexibility of Batu Hijau but importantly for our mine planning efforts we really need to get the Pinjam Pakai here in the next a little bit or we will make some decisions and move on.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right, just to clear, there would be no production impacts through 2011 which is the bottom of phase five, because essentially what we would is the delay stripping on phase six. The area where this waste needs to go is for the next big lay back. So it's a little ironic because our results would actually be better through 2011, because we would have effectively park trucks and not do stripping and essentially dive to the bottom of phase five. That's obviously not optimum for the long term operations, but there are some of the flexibility that Dick alluded to.
Unidentified Analyst: In other words, like lower production, better costs, the alternative that you get every single lined up, what type of production do you think you can get to?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: We really haven't given those estimates for future years. Really our estimate for Batu for this year is the estimate we have given. And at this point what I'll tell you is what we really anticipate as Russ said is probably better results as we would. If we are stripping wastes, we are producing from stockpile. If we are not stripping wastes, we are producing from the pit, and if we are at the bottom of the pit we are producing the highest ore possible.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Oscar we'll be in a fairly big strip campaign for phase 5, through '08 and '09. We will be in the bottom of phase 5 in '010 and '011. So when you look at '07, we had significant production that was coming out of the bottom, '010 and '011 is the bottom of phase 5. And that's when we will be really be in the sweet spot once again, so 8 and 9 we are going to have another production levels, just because of the nature of the ore body.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great Russ, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Mark Smith, you may ask your question.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Yes hi I have got a couple questions. For Russell... Russell perhaps if you could just help me with the... what were realized prices for Q1 before the inventory adjustments?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Before which inventory adjustments Mark, sorry?
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Before the adjustments from fourth quarter.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes I mean the really one inventory adjustment we just held that and sold in the first quarter so we did see a slight pickup because obviously the gold price and copper price was up. But the production from that inventory is reflected in the numbers the 933 for gold and the copper. The copper number is impacted by the provisional mark to market again right at the end of last year and you saw this with Freeport's results a couple of days ago. Copper prices were down, March 31, they were up. So we marked that provisional pricing to market. So we had for the quarter and you will see this on page 29 roughly of the Q, I am not sure what the final page was on the version we launched last night. But the spot price we received before hedging was $363. We had a provisional mark to market gain of $0.78 for 440 and we had $0.30 in treatment and refining to put us at about 410 for the quarter.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: And the gold I mean you are also on the gold...
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: [indiscernible] $4, $5 of treatment and refining otherwise the 933 is effectively the price we got.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: And it wasn't also in that same concentrate.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We had a little gold and concentrate at Batu but in the scheme of the Newmont its de minimus.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay. All right, okay, well congratulations, I mean $10 above spot. Just... and the second question is did the original guidance include that adjustment in moving community development administration... regional bend royalties and so on so forth out from cash costs into the other expenses, such about 32 to 38 [indiscernible]?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think it's about $12 plus $4 of accretion mark for the quarter, and we... so just stepping back you are right. We moved those that weren't in the budget. So what we've seen is effectively the higher metal and FX being offset by that reduction. All the numbers in the Q are we stated, we classified at least to reflect that change. So when we compare numbers year-on-year they do reflect a similar transfer from the previous years.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: No I understand they are like that now but I am just trying to get a hand on the original... the guidance you gave me at year end that did not include that change?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It did not include.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay, so we're over and above that. And then finally just on Kalgoorlie, just could you give me a little bit of an idea why it were up nearly $800 an ounce?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Mark that's a great question. And Brian Hill, who recently joined us in February and his team in Australia are spending sometime there really to understand that. There are a number of issues related to that not the least of which is the exchange rate, the legacy nature of the operation, some increased stripping, we have seen some grades, model grade bias is down obviously, some availability issues with equipment. So there are a number of issues quite frankly, and I would say that part of those issues are the only substructure in the way in the operation is managed. So we have been on our list if you want Brian is actively pursuing that with his counterpart down in Australia from Barrack [ph] and we have committed jointly resources to really evaluating the operation from a long term perspective. But it is a concern to us and it is getting to our attention right now, little early Mark to give anything definitive on the way that's going
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay, but I guess it's not just a significant labor issue as well...
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: No it's not a one time event but it's something that we just have to really go in and dig into and figure out what we are going to do with that operation.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Is your new... is your FX position or your FX hedge is going to help with you at all?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It willhelp... we have started to layer into that program. We have about $600 million already normally hedged and we continue to layer into that program. So it will offset or mitigate some of it but again at these levels of spot significantly higher than we had in the budget. So even if we lock everything today we'd still be above where we were on our budgeted assumption.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: All right thanks Russ...
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Mark.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. David Haughton you may ask your question.
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: Yes, good morning Dick and Russ. I've been checking over various questions running through so far but something that caught my eye was Nassau in Suriname at the analyst day, you had some positive words to say about it but text does describe some further exploration but didn't appear in your slide show, do you have any update on that?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Steve Enders I think you are online, do you want to just give a quick update on those projects?
M. Stephen Enders - Senior Vice President, Worldwide Exploration: Yes, sure. Can you hear me? Yes, David we talked about Nassau at our analyst day presentation and this is our joint venture with Nassau with Alcoa in Suriname. And it's currently in our stage two of our stage gate process headed for the decision whether we declare non-mineralized reserves at the end of that state and probably fourth quarter or not. And we are encouraged with our results so far. And we'll see where that one goes. So it's progressing as planned right now.
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: Okay, so it's a little bit behind the other three that we saw in the slide presentation then.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes it is.
M. Stephen Enders - Senior Vice President, Worldwide Exploration: Yes it is as a matter of fact. I mean it was a greenfield discovery and those always have a longer timeframe to get to this point.
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: Okay.Another question going back to Ghana, that's been fairly topically lately. Do you have any perspective on the documents that we've seen coming out of the minister recently with regard to the government wanting a little bit more exposure if you like to the revenue coming out of mining?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes I would just tell you, we've seen those announcements. We have not seen anything definitive come out, that that would impact us directly. We do have a relative to our original investment, and investment agreement which protects us from increases like that. I would just tell you that when we find out what the direct impact would be, of course we'll sit down with the government. We'll talk with them about what their intentions are. What the results would be for us, and we'll figure out right way forward. But that's what we'll do everywhere, not just in Ghana. So hopefully as a result of those discussions we'll come up something that makes sense relative to about their commitments to us and our commitments to them,
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: All right, while still in Ghana can you explain a little bit more about this power situation? I thought that the hydropower had got back to normal, are we getting back into a drought situation, again?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, actually levels in the hydro facility are at pretty good levels. Unfortunately, they produce a lot of power from hydro, this is the year where they seem to be producing some earlier in the year. We'll just have to see what happens with the continued rainfall later in the year. At this point what's really impacting our operation is not so much power unavailability as it is power spiking, and that's led to some issues with respect to the mill as we talked about as well as power availability. But over time we're just going to have to continue to manage the power situation in Ghana, there is no silver bullet here.
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: All right and I guess that feeds into what the decision might be for Akyem going forward?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: It does absolutely.
David Haughton - BMO Nesbitt Burns: All right. Thank you very much.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks David.
Operator: The next question from John Tumazos [Prudential Equity Group].
John Tumazos - Prudential Equity Group: I don't want to set the bar too high after the good performance. But Phoenix continues above expectation and the water issues at Batu Hijau can be rectified. Is there possibility that you come in at the low end of your budget?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: With respect to costs.
John Tumazos - Prudential Equity Group: 420 to 450 range.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: John there is a lot going on as you know with respect to escalation in other areas of the business. Pretty early in the year for us to forecast that, I'd just say we continue to be comfortable with our guidance --
John Tumazos - Prudential Equity Group: There had been the power plant venture among the several gold companies operating in Ghana, presumably with below budget output in mill throughput in the March quarter, there must have been some other base level of the power supply that gone under mine that sort of diluted the efforts, presumably the group power plant, is that the case?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: No the group power plant is in place. We did have some issues ramping it up and we're still working on optimizing the production out there. We had a fire at one of the units. We've gone in and fixed that. But again this really... our production at Ahafo was not so much power shortage as that was really just the inability of the system to manage power in ways which delivered clean power continually and that led to some ramp up and ramp down issues at Ahafo.
John Tumazos - Prudential Equity Group: It was atransition rather than generation system.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, over time and as I mentioned additional infrastructure has been completed by the Ghanaians and we expected that issue now that we have two ways of bringing power into Ahafo should be improved going forward. That improvement in the transmission system will not bring additional generation capacity but hopefully cleaner power. To your point the MRP that the power plant that four gold companies has put in place is still planned to bring additional production into Ghana we hope that that will allow us to continue to benefit from allocation of power shortages consistent with allocations to the general public. There will still be power shortages in Ghana over the near term as we have not seen any new generation back for what we brought in coming into the country.
John Tumazos - Prudential Equity Group: thank you.
Operator: Our final question is from Mark Smith.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Yes hi guys. Just a quick follow up, your exploration spending and development spending was a little lower than sort of a quarterly average for the year. Is that just due to waiting to get on to the Miramar property and then also when would you add the current 43-101 Miramar 10.7 million ounces to your resource base.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mark its Russ. I'll raise phase product [ph] and it's really due to the ramp up that we see at Hope Bay that really we got to go in late March. We do have the drillers on the ground and we are seeing spending increase in line with our numbers. So really it's just a timing issue. As far as 43-101 equivalent I'll ask Steve Enders to give you an update on that.
M. Stephen Enders - Senior Vice President, Worldwide Exploration: Yes Mark. There is a significant difference between 43-101 versus what Newmont declares as NRM, certainly a lot different than what we declare as reserves. And at this point we are looking at completing stage 2, end of this year or early next year which would get us NRM, and it would be some subset of the 10 million or so ounces in Hope Bay... pardon me... in Miramar's 43-101 resource base and we'll gradually convert those over time, as we continue our exploration program.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay well perhaps u will actually get more than that?
M. Stephen Enders - Senior Vice President, Worldwide Exploration: Well that's the whole plan, but you can't get it all in one bite right?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think it's important to note that we won't book any reserves this year. We just physically can't get the work done, given the infrastructure upgrades and requirements that we need and the amount of drilling that's going to take. So, don't look for reserves this year but as Steve said, we will just be working them through, with the passage of time.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: I was just looking for MNI and inferred.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Keep looking, we'll bring it in.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: All right thanks.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much for your attention today and we will look forward another call in July.
Operator: Thank you participating on today conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2007 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg. You may begin.
John Seaberg - Investor Relations: Thank you operator. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and 2007 earnings conference call. I'd like to introduce Dick O'Brien, who will be leading our presentation today. Thank you.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us today in our fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Before we get started, I just want to remind you that we'll be discussing forward-looking information involving a number of risks, certain of which are unique to our industry as described in our SEC filings. I also want to acknowledge that a number of analysts on this call have already had a full day of earnings reports and conference calls and we appreciate the time you take to set aside to participate in our call. So, thank you for that. As many of you are aware, we recently held an Analyst Day where we discussed in detail the results of operations for the fourth quarter and for the year, our reserves at the end of 2007, and our guidance for 2008. Because that information is available for you on our web site at www.newmont.com, today's call will be relatively short. So we will focus largely on our financial performance for the fourth quarter, which we didn't talk about at the Analyst Meeting, and for the year. We will also briefly recap what we accomplished in 2007 and we accomplished a lot to refocus our company on our core gold business and review our outlook for 2008. We will give you a brief update on Hope Bay and how we are integrating that asset and the Hope Bay team into our portfolio organization. Finally we will give you an update brief on the divestiture situation in Indonesia. Before we get started, another quick update. Some of you maybe aware there was an earthquake near Elko, Nevada early this morning. Brant Hinze called me very early this morning. His time indicated that they were checking to see what damage and we are pleased to report that there are no employee injuries or adverse impacts to our operations. We have had time to inspect our underground infrastructure and have found no deficiencies. We will of course update you if the situation changes. Looking at the first slide, in July 2007, our management team committed to refocusing on our gold... core gold business and with that commitment we stepped up, took decisive action, we implemented and successfully executed on several strategic initiatives. And those initiatives have provided us momentum as we move into 2008. So I just want to spend a minute making sure that people understand what we have accomplished here in a relatively short period of time. First, in June, towards the end of June, we closed out our hedge book position in Newmont as the largest unhedged gold producer allowing our shareholders to take full advantage of the current gold bull market So this year rather than delivering approximately 1 million ounces of $384 per ounce, which would have been our commitment had we not gotten out of the hedge book. Newmont and its shareholders will benefit from the current plus $900 gold price environment that we find ourselves in. Second, we had an extremely successful monetization of royalty assets delivering unrecognized value from our balance sheet in a really thoughtful transaction that allowed us to raise capital to provide capital for Miramar and other opportunities that we have in our current balance sheet. Monetization of our royalty assets successfully delivered unrecognized value from our balance sheet and provided about $600 million gain and about $1.3 billion of capital. So our foundation as we go into 2008 has been further strengthened by our renewed focus on operational improvements. We've had two very effective quarters in doing what we said we're going to do and delivering on our operational performance. In addition to that, we are getting more effective in our capital through a capital effectiveness program that we talked about in detail at our Analyst Day. We continue to focus on our continuous commitment to sustainable partnering with host communities around the world and this year we are proud to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index World becoming the only gold company to be added to this index. And rest assured, we will continue to work hard to ensure that we live up to the promises that we've made. Before we turn things over to Russ... Russell Ball, our CFO to discuss 2007 results and the 2008 outlook, I'm just going to highlight a few things that speak to our ongoing transitional momentum over the last eight months. As I mentioned two strong consecutive quarters on the operational performance, we understand two quarters doesn't a year even make, it certainly doesn't a company make but I'm telling you, people here are motivated because we are beginning to turn around the operations and we're beginning to have more confidence in our capability to deliver on what we say we're going to do. Russ is going to talk about the 2008 guidance that we've given you. I can tell you that every person at Newmont is committed to doing everything it takes to delivering at or above that guidance. So we met our guidance in the fourth quarter on equity ounces and cost applicable to sales and we met that guidance even though we made the conscious decision to not accelerate production and sales in fourth quarter. I committed to people that we were not going to backend load this company anymore that we're going to try to flatten production out, we still do have weather dependencies and we still do maintenance in the second quarter as we explained but we have made a conscious effort to not put everything into the fourth quarter. And I would say many analysts mid-year said we'll never make it. You won't make it in the fourth quarter, too much production, your cost are really going to have to come down. We did it. We did what said we're going to do. We also in 2007 made significant investments in the future and we position the company take advantage of what believe will be strengthening gold price environment. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Russ who will dissect our fourth quarter somewhat complicated reported financial results.
Russel Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Dick and let me firstly apologize for the non-accountants that spent [inaudible] this morning at least working their way through our numbers. I will say that despite the red ink, you see in the table up there, we actually had an extremely strong fourth quarter and I will explain why in some detail. Looking at the table, equity gold sales as Dick said right on line at about 5.3 for the year. We did as Dick said made conscious decision not to push our operations right to the limit. And in fact ended up sitting on about 80,000 equity ounces and 19 million equity pounds of copper at year-end in order to affect what Dick has talked to about a level or more consistent, if you want, production profile and not always having the back-end loading. And again that gives us more confidence going into 2008. The realized gold prices you see, strong fourth quarter at 785 and around 700 for the year, but clearly a long way off the roughly $949, $950 that we are sitting at today. So to Dick's point, the company is focused on delivering the numbers that I'll point out in our 2008 outlook. And if you do that we should see significant margin expansions and significantly improve bottom line. The cost applicable to sales, again a strong fourth quarter, we were at 384 and for the year around 406. As we spoke to the analysts a couple of weeks ago we mad a conscious decision not to hedge the Aussie dollar and that cost us $9 or $10. If you subtract that, we would have been roughly… we would have been at the higher end of our original guidance back in January this year. We do have an ongoing program to hedge some of those exposures and we have to reduce some of that volatility going forward. And as I said and I will move to the next slide, the accountants, myself included, managed to put a lot of red on the income statement. The one thing even as the accountants can't mess up is the cash flow. And if you look at the cash flow for the quarter, it speaks to the strength of the operation. We were at $630 million. You see the number there for the full year at $525 million. That really is impacted by some one-off transactions that we have provided more detail on earnings release in which you can find an excruciating detail in the 10-K, which was filed a couple of hours ago. The normalized number is about 1.6, but you can see the leverage for the fourth quarter at around 1.4 million, at again 785 we produced about $630 million in operating cash flow. Capital for the year, as Dick said, we continue to continue to focus through the capital effectiveness program and we came in at $100 million or so below the low end of our original guidance. So, while it might not have looked like it and certainly I think it was Victor Flores commenting this morning that you could drive yourself nuts trying to figure out what they actually earned. Hopefully as we turn to slide 5, I can do that fairly quickly because a lot of these items we had spoken to the Street about and disclosed to the Street before we reported numbers this morning. So, focusing on the quarter, we did end up having to take an impairment charge. It is a non-cash charge related to exploration goodwill. This goodwill was put on the books in February 2002 with the three-way acquisition of Normandy and Franco-Nevada. We have spent a lot of time discussing that accounting and the model we have to substantiate that value with the ACC over the years. What the model dose do is it requires us to update assumptions every year and when we updated the assumptions this year in light of higher capital operating and finding costs somewhat offset by a higher gold price assumption, a higher risk-free rate, which results in higher discount rate to apply to future cash flows and the less than expected exploration additions that were built into the model. Again, the model was meant to extrapolate or historical results are meant to extrapolate predictive success of the future and we had to adjust what was in the model for the results over the last couple of years, which we communicated to the Street a couple of weeks ago for 2007 at least. So, when we did that in random numbers, we weren't able to substantiate the value that was on the balance sheet so we took the $1.12 billion charge in the fourth quarter. Again, non-cash because there is no deferred tax implication, both the pre and post-tax numbers are the same. We did have to write down in terms of our accounting policy to investments, one was in Shore Gold and the other in the Gabriel, the Rosia Montana project. In terms of our policy again if the securities under it cost for more than a six-month period, we write it down. Again non-cash and when those investments turn, clearly we will be able to recognize a gain if they do turn, otherwise we have recognized the loss to the end of the year. So, another non-cash charge. We, as Dick alluded to, had a very successful IPO of the royalty portfolio, another non-core asset. Again pre-tax gain of about $900 million, you will see reflected there as a post-tax gain of $600 million. Again because we made the decision in Q2 that we were getting out of the merchant banking business, which is reflected in the discontinued operation section of the income statement. We had a minor tax adjustment on Zarafshan was a gain. So we put it up there. And then we had other discontinued operations, which is basically the royalty portfolio to the date of the transaction, December 21. So, those royalties accrued to us for most of the fourth quarter but obviously one accrued to us for 2008 and onwards and a small gain from the sale of Pajingo asset. So when you do the math and as we spoke to our Board yesterday, you get to about $0.50 number for the quarter. Looking at the full year, in addition to those items we spoken to, we did have the loss in the second quarter that Dick... on third quarter at least that Dick mentioned when we eliminated the hedge book. That's reflected there of $358 million. In addition to that we had spoken previously to the Street about the charge we took on the minority interest loan repayment at Batu Hijau. In addition, we wrote off the merchant banking goodwill, again another non-tax charge. We took that in the second quarter and that again reflects our decision to exit the merchant banking business and that was again reflected in our second quarter results that are shown here for the year-to-date. Some minor other adjustments but again you can do the math somewhere in the 120 to 130 range is where we ended up for 2007. So while we do acknowledge certainly a lot of items or transactions that impacted both the quarter and the year, again a lot of them tied directly to the strategic initiatives that Dick alluded to. So, when you look at the cash flows and in particular based on the realized price, you can actually see we had a very strong quarter notwithstanding the fact that we once sat on a lot of inventory and two had a significant unrealized write... not writedown but mark-to-market adjustment on our copper provisional pricing at Batu. For those who follow the industry Freeport had a similar adjustment where essentially we reflect sales that are still outstanding and being provisionally priced at the spot price of year-end, which was I think $3.02 is what we use. Today with copper around 370 odd, we should see most, if not all of that, comeback in the first quarter or second quarter of 2008. So again it's just a timing issue and reflects the volatility, quite frankly of the copper price and the fact that all of our copper in this case and gold is unhedged. So again turning to slide 5 or 6 now, focusing on the outlook for 2008, again we communicated this a couple of weeks ago in our release and at our Analyst Day. Equity gold sales largely flat somewhere between 5.1 and 5.4, cost applicable to sales, I think it's a 6% increase. The last time I looked at it, it was about 4.25 to 4.50. I will predicate that with an $80 with taxes fuel assumption and an $87.5 Aussie, we are obviously offside on both those assumptions today, but at least in respect of the Aussie dollar we are putting in a disciplined hedging program that will eliminate some of that volatility going forward. Copper sales, slightly down as we... again we spoke to the analyst. 2008 and 2009 at Batu reflect years of lower grades and higher strip, 2010 and 11 were back in the heart of the old body at the bottom of Phase V and we will see those numbers climb significantly. The lower sales is reflected in the higher cost at Batu. Consolidated CapEx, which includes about $200 million of minority CapEx that we end up consolidating from Batu and Yanacocha somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2 billion and you can see the rest of the numbers. Just may be focusing on the tax rate for a second, obviously a lot of volatility and movement around that tax rate with all these non-recurring items, again as I've said before, somewhere between 30% and 34% is a long-term tax rate, excluding the effect of these once-off transaction, if you want, that can distort the tax rate significantly.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Russel. Moving to the next slide, I'd like to welcome the former Miramar employees to Newmont, if they are listening on the call. We appreciate your success as to date at Hope Bay and look forward to your contributions in the future as we develop this world-class gold deposit. In addition, they are now controlling one of the largest undeveloped gold projects in the world with Miramar having already identified over 10 million ounces of gold resources at Hope Bay. We've also added significant strength to our Newmont team. As we proceed with evaluating the development options available, the integration of the personnel continues to progress as planned with the cross-functional team now in place. Guy Lansdown, our Senior Vice President, Safety Project Development and Technical Services will provide project development executive oversight. Steve Enders, Senior Vice President, Exploration will provide exploration executive oversight and Brant Hinze, our Regional Vice President for North America will provide regional executive oversight as the Hope Bay operations team will ultimately become part of the North American regional team. For this acquisition, again building on the successes we had in 2007, another indication of momentum, buying an asset that we had initially invested in, we understood very well, able to do clean due diligence on, understood what was moving forward with the asset in development, district scale asset provides opportunities for sustainable, lower cost production in future high-grade reserve replacement. This is the value of thinking and investing strategically. We must get our execution of the operating assets right and we will and we've told you that we must also build for the future. So, we are doing both. And we'll update you as we determine how we are going to maximize the value of the Hope Bay asset for Newmont, our shareholders, and the local communities. The next slide, I just want to focus briefly on the Batu Hijau divesture update. The first slide just sets up the structure, really focusing in the red circle, what is it that's separate Batu Hijau. For those of you who have followed the situation, the government delivered a letter to us saying that if we don't complete the divestiture of the 3% and 7% vintage, which came due in 2006 and 2007, if we don't complete that by February 22, they will put us into default basically under the contract to work. So, this is the structure. You can see Sumitomo and ourselves currently own a certain percentage and you can see walking down the potential interest on the far right that we will end up with 49% in 2010 has under the contract to work, which we signed, we've acknowledge we've signed, we understand our obligations are committed to live up to them. We know just what we need to do here. The process is a bit undefined as to how we get it done. That's sort of what we have been working through over the last couple of years. But you'll note that today we have a 10% obligation that we need to divest. More precisely, we need to have offered. We have made offers; we're working with the Government. I would say it is day-to-day as to what happens. And going to the next slide, you can see that we did offer to sell 3% for a $109 million in 2006. We offered further 7% for $282 million in 2007. Central Government of Indonesia declined to accept those offers but instructed us to deal with the local governments, which we've been doing. You can see in the fourth bullet point, we actually did sell a 2% carried interest. We have an agreement to sell it. It is not sold yet, but we do have an agreement to sell. The Indonesian Government, as I mentioned, delivered this notice default on February 11. So we firmly, firmly disagree with the allegation that we have breached the contract to work. That said we are working with the government to try to make sure that we do everything that we can to avoid a default situation. And that we go ahead and continue to do what we thought we have been doing, which is to actually complete our obligation. We know we have an obligation to complete. We are doing everything we can to get that done. I hope we can continue to work constructively to try to avoid a situation where we would otherwise have to invoke international arbitration to protect our interest at Batu Hijau, a last resort. Hope we don't have to do that. It's day-to-day. We will let you know what the updates are as we come to conclusion here over… we hope, a relatively short period of time. So with that, the last slide really focusing on what is it all about here at Newmont. In 2007, the last half, it's been about getting the portfolio of assets right, focusing on our operational execution, beginning to focus on the future through our investment in Miramar and positioning this company as the world's premier unhedged gold company by getting out of the hedge book, selling the royalty portfolio to both raise cash but also to get us out of investments, which were in some cases not gold related and move us into a position where we have a future for continuing to build the business off of execution, and off of successful exploration project development. And as we move forward we have a number of projects, including Boddington, which we talked to the analysts about and anyone else who listen to our conference call. We're setting the company up for a lower cost structure overtime. And I just want to close by talking a little bit about margins and where we stand today. So last year average gold price $697, our CAS of 406 with a gross margin of $291 an ounce. Notably, if we took the aggressive stands of reporting byproduct credits differently, actually that margin would expand by a $120 to about $411 an ounce. Go forward to this year, because I can do the math. 950 mid-point estimate of our CAS 425, that's a $425 an ounce margin, quite a bit of expansion. And again looking forward to copper credits applied, we'd go up by a $130 an ounce to almost $555 an ounce. So, do we have gold leverage? Absolutely. Do we have project hedges? No. Every ounce we sell is sold at the current price. So, we're positioning this company for gold leverage. We're positioning the company for long-term success. We are going to execute on what we said we were going to do. We're going to deliver on the projects that we have in front of us, including Boddington, the gold mill will finish the power plant. We will reduce the cost structure in Nevada. If you look year-to-year our CAS, we are company who CAS is going to, I believe, be less… we will see less growth in our CAS than the rest of the industry, why? because we got focused on this last year because we have people who are committed to do what we say we are going to do. Our margins will expand this year. I think the company is set for success and not just for this year, but for the future. So, thanks my management team for providing the initiatives that we got done in 2007. Thanks to our investors for your patience as we work through this, but we are beginning to turn the corner here at Newmont. I feel positive about where we are. So, with that we will open it up for questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Independent.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Independent: Good afternoon. In terms of the monies you are spending for the Hope Bay drilling this year, how much would be step-out or new exploration as opposed to infill drilling and testing the data from Miramar?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, it's Dick. This is an advanced exploration project. As you know, there are some areas where we are going to be doing some infill drilling, but we believe that this has substantial long-term value. We will be doing some step-out drilling as well. We haven't given the precise figure for what our budgets are for this year. Suffice it to say that our exploration budget is up to about… given the numbers it’s up about $40 million, part of that's inflation, but a big part of it is Miramar. We will be spending money on significant drilling activities up at Miramar.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And John, Russ, just adding to that, we should be careful in not expecting reserve additions instantly. We have put the project into a stage-gate process. The way we look at is we will see significant or potentially significant NRM in additions in 2008 and into 2009 and 10 on the reserve side. So, again, we have a program, but we have just inherited the assets and the exploration folks are working with, most of the Miramar team that came over to really determine where we want to put those dollars. It's still very early in the process, as you know we just essentially acquired the asset.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Independent: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Hill of Citi.
John Hill - Citi: Thank you very much and thanks for a very forthright presentation following up on a lot of operations at Investors Day a few weeks ago. Dick, I was just wondering when you think about funding the company's cash flow deficit for 2008, including acquisitions and such of course, will you might commit to filling this cash deficit without further equity dilution?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Will we commit? No, we will tell you that we will make sure that we utilize our equity judiciously, that we will value it appropriately, but will I commit to not issuing equity, no, I don't know exactly what we are going to do John. But I will tell you we will do everything we can to make sure that we ensure shareholder value. At this point we have a cash flow deficit for the year, which we plan on funding through a combination of balance sheet sources that we have today, some additional borrowings. Do I see anything and that normal environment would require the issuance of equity, no. But would we over time consider if we saw something else, we might.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And John, Russ, I'll just add to that for those who haven’t had a chance to look at our 10-K, we moved our investment in Canadian Oil Sands Trust from a current liability to a long-term liability... long-term assets, sorry, based on... it's been a long couple of days, based on our intension or discussions amongst management that we see no likelihood of selling that asset in the next 12 months basically [ph] part on the IPO, the significantly higher proceeds we received, the strong operating cash flow from the fourth quarter and current metal prices, which at 900 turns that deficit into a surplus.
John Hill - Citi: Great. But just for clarification as we ranked the various alternatives for funding that cash deficit everything from perhaps examining the treatment of byproduct revenue streams and such or asset sales, do you regard equity dilution to be high on the priority list or rock bottom at the lower end of the priority list?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Clearly John, equity is at the bottom, it's not our first... it's not the first arrow we're going to pull out of the quiver. I believe that with additional strength in gold prices, margin expansion, we have other opportunities before we need to dive into the equity portfolio.
John Hill - Citi: Great. Just putting in a plug for per share reserves, per share production and per share earnings and cash flow. Thank you.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Interesting that you choose to apply that to us and how many other companies have acquired reserves and production over the years. I would like to see somebody do that analysis. Good question.
Operator: Our next question is from Victor Flores of HSBC.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Russ, I did say you could drive yourself nuts but I can assure you that I am completely saint.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We never questioned that Victor.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Listen, just sort of following on, on the discussion on Hope Bay, when do you think you will be in a position to share with the market what do you think the likely development plan would be for that asset? The Miramar guys had put out some various scenarios looking at how to potentially tackle the various deposits that are up there. When do you think you'll be in a position to say here's Newmont's vision for this asset?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Victor, this is Guy Lansdown. Victor, as Russel said it's currently in our stage-gate process and the plan is to go through the current phase through the end of this year, beginning of next year. So that's the kind of timeframe we are looking at.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Basically, another say year to year-and-a-half of really wrapping your arms around it?
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Yeah. I'm sorry, you had a question about the permits.
Victor Flores - HSBC: No, I am just saying you might want to mention it.
Guy Lansdown - Senior Vice President, Project Development and Operations Services: Yeah, we are waiting permits on those north and we will continue to be doing engineering and the work required to put the reminder of our permits in place.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just following on two other projects, can you give us update on what your current thought process is on both Akyem and Conga?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Both projects are up for review this year. We haven't given a precise time frame, but we continue to optimize those projects and should bring them forward to our Board for consideration this year.
Victor Flores - HSBC: So, you mean... sorry, so when you mean that you are assessing them, it's not an assessment of we might keep it, we might not. It's an assessment of how best to proceed with them.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, this is an assessment with their current environment of construction and projects and the way we are addressing capital factored at Newmont, we've taken both projects Conga and Akyem, put them in our stage-gate process, we are fully evaluating the feasibility and economics. And as we continue to optimize that, we're just trying to decide how best to bring the projects forward and we will bring those forward for Board consideration this year.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from David Haughton of BMO Capital Markets.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Good afternoon, and thank you. Russell, a question for you, I know that when you went through slide 5, you'd identified some of the issues that had taxed attached to it and though it didn't, just as a simple summary, for those items that are abnormal, as you've identified them in slide 5 what's the tax payable or tax effect in the P&L?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Dave, good question. The numbers that you see here reflect after-tax, the write-down on the market of securities, which are held up in Canada, the long-term tax rate is 18%, the rates are essentially tax effective at 35%. The merchant banking, goodwill and the exploration goodwill have no tax impact. So the pre and post-tax numbers are the same.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. All I am trying to do here is to get an idea of what's your adjusted net profit after-tax compared to flushing all these things through. That's what I'm trying to get to. Thank you.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'd say going back to the royalty portfolio, we... what you see on the income statement is net of the tax rate, 35%. However, through some good and effective tax planning, we have reduced that to somewhere between 10% and 15% on an actual cash flow basis. So while we've taken the full 35 to the income statement, because there's some tax attributes, we had some tax planning, that was put into place, in fact related to the Miramar acquisition, we were able to reduce the leakage to about 10% to 15%.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: All right. Thank you for that. The other question I have, having a look at the cash flow statement, lots of big numbers going in and out. Can you just confirm that the Franco numbers are in and the cash going out to Miramar is out in 2007 period, it all happened during the last couple of days of the year?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: So Dave, what we did is we took the royalty portfolio, the income from the royalty portfolio and showed that in cash flow from discontinued operations. So that's effectively below the line. Again what we're trying to show is what's indicative going forward, we have to say it will on be the plight next year. So we went back to '06 and '05 and did the same treatment and took those cash flows related to that royalty portfolio and put it down into discontinued operations.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets: All right. Thank you very much, Russell.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Smith of Dundee Securities.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Yeah, just a very, very quick question. Just as you... if you are to deliver additional interest in Batu Hijau to the Indonesian government or locals at what point in the ownership structure, do you start to equity account it rather than consolidate it?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah David. That's an interesting question. Where we are is we end up consolidating because of the post Enron, if you want, special purpose entities we have a 45% economic interest in PTNNT. We do consolidate because of our disproportionate share in the economic benefits of the partnership that sits above that. While it's not an exact science and it's a function of the deals we structure, whether these deals are carried interest or whether we actually collect cash. I'd say that just as a best-case estimate, probably the '09 timeframe, we would end up deconsolidating if we carry the interest, if we sell it for cash that might happen sooner. But again it's a function of these deals and the transactions we enter into. So it's hard to give you an exact date. It will be a function of, as Dick says, how the negotiations progress and where we end up on providing financing or not providing financing. As part of that November 30 offer to the local governments we did provide what we believe to be a very attractive financing scheme that would encourage them to take ownership under our financing, because quite frankly we would like them as long-term partners with us on the Batu Hijau project.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Terry Ortslan of TSO & Associates.
Terry Ortslan - TSO & Associates: Thanks. Russel, the Miramar Hope Bay numbers are in the... on slide 6, advanced project numbers?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Some of it’s in advanced projects and some of it's in exploration. That's about 30 in each, 30 of it in the advanced projects and about 30 in exploration.
Terry Ortslan - TSO & Associates: Okay. On the CapEx numbers, what's the sustaining capital component of that $1.8 billion to $2 billion number that you have for this year?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Now, $1 billion to $1.1 billion of the three big projects that 600, 650 being Boddington, 200 on the power plant and roughly the same down in Peru just for round numbers. And the balance being sustaining and other in the operations. So, when we look at it, it's roughly 50%, 55% those three big projects and the balance right evenly across the portfolio.
Terry Ortslan - TSO & Associates: Right. And you also gave us the assumption for the, for the cost by I think $70 or $80 barrels of oil, is that?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, $80.
Terry Ortslan - TSO & Associates: And what's the sensitivity for each 10 bugs or so.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We run about 3 million barrels a year.
Terry Ortslan - TSO & Associates: Okay. Fair enough. All right great, thank you.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question needs from Damon Wells of Damon Wells Interests.
Damon Wells - Damon Wells Interests: Good afternoon. Could you give us some idea of these higher than nature of your extensive landholdings of which, and those part of that might one day be perspective I understand the acreage of the square miles is quite huge but could you quantify and describe that please?
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Could I quantify, probably If have the 10-K in front of me, I could give you the hectares that we own. But, I would tell you we have substantial land positions in Nevada where we are behind the U.S. Government, the largest landholder in Nevada. Some areas highly prospective, some areas we are already operating on and others where we have attended facilities like our power plant. So, we have many usages of the assets that we have in Nevada, still some exploration opportunity there. In addition we've properties in Peru, where we think the Conga District and around Yanacocha continues to be prospective for us. So, we still have opportunities there and of course Canada we have Hope Bay highly prospective area, a big green stone belt, which as just a small part of it has been explored to date. And then finally, we still have some areas in Indonesia, under our contract of work and do we also have some properties still near, some of our underground in Australia. And in Ghana of course we have the half of north projects still developing along that strike. We still have exploratory work going on. So, we continue to feel good about the project around half.
Damon Wells - Damon Wells Interests: Well, that's good...
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: Actually I don't have the exact numbers, but again, we think there is a good option to be had in Newmont with respect to our ongoing ability to deliver to exploration and the numbers are in the 10-K for our land holdings.
Damon Wells - Damon Wells Interests: That's very encouraging. Thank you for answering the question.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome. Thank you for your question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Brian MacArthur of UBS Securities.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities: Good afternoon. I was wondering if you can give me any guidance on the 2% that you proposed to, sell to the other partner, was that based on the 2006 valuation, 2007 valuation or can you give me any guidance whatsoever?
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Brian, again as I said we have two valuations, we gave you the numbers for the interest but on 100% basis the '06 was $3.6 billion, the '07 was $4 billion. I will say that as we work through the valuation that was required at the end of '07 we expect it to be significantly higher than that but again we are still working through that evaluation. The offer we made to the local government in order to encourage them to participate in the project was for the '07 share at the '06 price. So, it was based of the 3.6, valuation of 3.6 billion on a 100% and it was carried interest. So they had accepted the financing offer we provided.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities: And sorry, the other 2% that one, under the same deal.
Russell Ball - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is just the only 2% with carriers that we have completed Brian.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities: Okay. So that was done under those terms okay. Thank you.
Richard T. O'Brien - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you very much everyone for your attendance and your questions today, we know a number of you have a lot of work to do so we're going to let you get back to it and we have a lot of work to do, we are going go back to running our gold company to deliver maximum value to shareholders. Thanks.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to theThird Quarter 2007 Conference Call. I would like to remind all parties today'sconference is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect atthis time. All parties will be in a listen-only mode until thequestion-and-answer session of today's conference. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn theconference over to, Mr. Richard O'Brien. Sir, you may begin.
Richard O'Brien: Thank you, operator. Thanks forjoining us today on our third quarter conference call. With me today areRussell Ball, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Guy Landsdown, our Senior Vice President of Project Development;Randy Engel, our Senior Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development;and John Seaberg, Group Executive, Investor Relations. While we get started I just wantto remind you that we will be discussing forward-looking information involvinga number of risks certainly which are unique to our industry as described inour SEC filings. On today's call we will focus onour third quarter financial results and we will also take the opportunity toprovide you with an update on our continuing progress with respect to ourstrategic initiatives. In the four months following myappointment as CEO, our team is focused on execution and decisiveness enablingus to successfully create the world's premier unhedged goal company, whilerenewing our commitment to our core gold business. I would remind you all that it'sonly been four months, and that while I am very pleased with the team, the teamefforts, and the focus that we've generated here in Newmont, we still have alot of work to do. As we begin to see the benefitsof our strategic efforts, we also remain focus on our day-to-day activities:including stabilizing our operating cost profile, improving our operationalperformance, developing our existing projects and creating value from ourprospective pipeline. We are also taking a renewedapproach to sustaining our business through a combination of exploration,development and from time-to-time where appropriately accretive acquisitions. Wealso know that success will not come overnight, but we'll achieve it throughconsistency, commitment and successful execution year-after-year,quarter-after-quarter and day-after-day. As previously mentioned, andshown on this slide, our strategic foundation has five main components focusingon; first: financial strength and flexibility, second: operational execution,third: project execution, fourth: exploration and commitment and fifth:leveraging the scope and scale of our global operations. We'll cover each of theseinitiatives throughout the rest of this call. Before we review the results fromour third quarter, I want to spend a few minutes viewing our outlook for theremainder of 2007. With only three months remaining in the year we have heldour outlook for equity gold sales to between 5.2 to 5.4 million ounces. Reflectingpreviously announced lower equity gold sales at Batu Hijau, the suspension ofoperations at Midas and ongoing challenges at Phoenix, which I will cover in more detaillater. In addition, we are implementingplans to reduce our traditional fourth quarter push, which should over timeresult in a flatter production profile on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Don't expectus to keep the foot on the accelerator here in the fourth quarter of every yeargoing forward. We do expect that, over time, we will flatten out this productionprofile. More over, this quarter we'vebenefited from Batu Hijau being at the bottom of the pit. That will not be thecase throughout all of the fourth quarter and we still have some additionalwork we are completing in Nevada to continue to move the Nevada profile up tothe expected production levels at Leeville. We still have some work to do hereto continue to get our production profile where it needs to be. Equity copper sales, the second lineon this slide, have decreased slightly from our initial guidance and this aswell as the equity gold sales at Batu Hijau were both reduced as a result oflesser economic interest that we have at Batu Hijau, due to the repayment byour minority partner there carried loan. But this is consistent with theguidance that we provided in the second quarter after that loan was repaid. We now expect 2007 costsapplicable to sales to be 400 to 430 per ounce, up from 375 to 400, as we toldpeople at the Denvergold show. We were expecting CIS to be beyond the upper range of the guidance.This is the new guidance. This change in outlook reflectsthe impact of the ongoing challenges at Phoenix,lost production at Midas, higher input costs primarily fuel adverse exchangerate movements. The remainder of the items are largely in line with our initialQ1 outlook, or slightly positive, in the case of capital expenditures and theeffective tax rate. As this chart illustrates, higherdiesel fuel and consumable costs represent approximately half of our increasein cost applicable to the sales for the year. If you move from the guidance tothe prior outlook on the left, to our current outlook on the right, you can seethat on the chart. The other major factor is thehigher cost in Nevada, at Phoenix, and reduced production at Midas,both of which are reflected in the production segment of the chart. Inaddition, as we benefit from a higher gold price, we do see a negative impacton our costs in the form of higher royalty payments and workers participationat Yanacocha in Peru. The adverse changes in foreignexchange rates, primarily in the Australian dollar, essentially represent thebalance of the change in our outlook from the beginning of the year till now. Tied from our challenges with Phoenix and Midas in Nevada, the operating cost escalation,illustrated in this chart, is probably reflected of the issues faced by theentire industry. Shifting our attention fromoperating results to financial results, this chart illustrates the absolutechange in our operating margin 2003 through Q3 2007. This is slide number 7. Asthis chart illustrates, gold is up over 85% since 2003, while our margins have grownby roughly 75% during the same period reflecting the impact of industry-widecost pressures. These pressures, when coupledwith the mature nature of the world's gold deposits, have somewhat suppressedthe industry's average operating margins. Ours have been impacted similarlywith our margins remaining consistently between, 40% to 50% of average realizedgold prices over the past several years. As a result, gold equityevaluation remained under pressure with multiple contractions evident acrossthe entire sector. We are keenly aware of these pressures and are focused onaddressing them through the initiatives I continue to emphasize each time Ihave the opportunity to speak with you. Our offer, compelling valueproposition for our shareholders, we know we must remain vigilant and focusedon cost control, operational execution, as well as new ways of exploring forand developing new projects. With the gold price today nowsignificantly higher than the 681 shown for the third quarter of 2007 on this chart,we continue to focus on operational execution and cost containment as we aresuccessful at that, we and our shareholders will benefit from higher marginexpansion going forward. So we have committed to keep themarket informed with respect to our progress at Phoenix and on slide 8; I am going to talkabout that for a minute. Phoenixcontinues to be the most challenging operation in our portfolio, while wecontinue to make progress and advance our improvement plans, it will still taketime to successfully work through each of the issues inhabiting the success ofthis long term asset. For the third quarter Phoenix'sequity gold sales were 46,000 ounces at cost applicable to sales of $605 perounce. For the year Phoenix's gold sales were just over 130,000 ounces at costapplicable to sales of $743. So improvement in the third quarter clearly but westill have our ways to go at Phoenix. During the quarter we mademodifications to the blasting process, which led to improved ore fragmentation,enhanced recoveries and process efficiencies. Phoenix now also continues to perform welland has recently been running in excess of 90% availability. Even with these changes we willnot know whether significant improvements in operating costs and production canbe achieved until we redefined the ore body and metallurgy. Our re-drilling program is wellunderway with approximately 46 of the 183 planned drill holes complete. Weremain on schedule to finalize this drill program in the first quarter of 2008.The drill data will then be used to create a new life of mine plan, which wecurrently anticipate will be completed by mid 2008. We're also addressing orehardness issues that have plagued us in startup with the installation of a newcrusher, which should be in place in the first half of 2008. Also at Phoenix we continue to evaluate a copperleach program that could allow us to process the oxide copper ore that sits ontop of the sulphide ore body. Copper leach project is incremental to theexisting Phoenix operation and has the potentialto reduce the overall operating costs at Phoenixby generating positive net revenue from material currently characterized aswaste. Although we remain optimisticabout the possibility of this project becoming a reality, it still remainssubject to considerable review and optimization studies with permitting on thecritical path. Our current estimate is that the copper SX/EW plant could startup in 2010 pending permitting and other factors. We'll continue to keep youinformed in our progress on this project. So, in summary, for the thirdquarter I am very pleased with the progress that the team has made with respectto the operational side of the business. I think people continue to exhibit allthat I could ask for them to do to really focus in on keeping their operatingcosts in check and trying to move the business forward at the same time. Ithink that reflects positively on results, because some people in the companyare listening to this call, I'd just like to take the opportunity to complimentpeople for keeping their heads down and getting the job done successfully. So with that I want to turn itover to Russell who focusing on financial strengths and flexibility is going towalk through the highlights of the third quarter.
Russell Ball: Thanks, Dick and good afternoonall. I will start with the financial highlights for the quarter noting that thedetails are contained in our earnings release and our 10-Q, which we expect tofile later this afternoon. In addition, for those who are watching our filings,you will see we will be making three filings related to the proposedacquisition of Miramaralso hopefully later this afternoon. The extent of detailed questions on yourresults, I am sure that John Seaberg and his team will be happy to walk youthrough the numbers. We had a strong third quarter,earning $0.88 a share. Essentially doubling our earnings from the year agoquarter. It is driven largely by higher commodity prices, as we realized thebenefit of being completely unhedged both on the gold and the copper side aswell as increased production as Dick discussed earlier from our Batu Hijauoperation. We generated approximately $520 million in cash from continuingoperations, which is up about a 150% from the previous year's quarter. Maybe it's important to look,just briefly, at the negative operating cash flow number that you see on slide10. We are about $100 million for the year-to-date, because this hedge isreflecting a number of the strategic initiatives that we have implemented sincethe change in leadership at Newmont. We have used about $580 millionto eliminate the gold hedge book in Q2. We also spent about $280 million tosettle a pre-acquisition tax contingency related to tax contingency Normandy and about $180million to settle the copper hedge obligations which expired in the first halfof 2007. So when you look at operating cash flow for the year, essentially weconsume just over $1 billion getting out of those hedge positions and settlinga pre acquisition contingency. For the quarter we realized anaverage gold price of $681 per ounce, which is up 11% from the year agoquarter. Costs were $388 an ounce, which is an increase of 22% from theyear-ago quarter and I will speak of that in some detail following. As Dickreferenced earlier, the continuing operating cost pressures are notparticularly unique to Newmont. For those following the slides onslide 11, you'll see that the reported net income for the quarter was impactedby two transactions. The first was a reversal offoreign tax credit valuation allowances of $84 million. You might recall thatin the second quarter we provided valuation allowances so it reflected a chargeof approximately $109 million, which is essentially what we reversed in thisquarter due to tax planning opportunities related to the sale of our merchantbanking assets and the royalty portfolio in particular. As you know note, I wouldappreciate our tax calculation is complex and is, as these last two quartershave proved, they can be very volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This isparticularly so in light of our discontinued operations reporting for themerchant banking portfolio and as their share in Newmont expropriation andsubsequent gain. As we look in turning at ourbusiness and for those of you crunching the numbers in your spread sheets. Weuse an effective tax rate of 32% for our planning purposes and while you willcontinue to see volatility going forward that's the number that we arecomfortable with that reflects the attributes that we have and the assets wehave in the locations we operate currently. In addition, during the quarterwe received $80 million pretax related to the settlement of the Zarafshanexpropriation, which again essentially reverses the $100 million pretax chargewe took in the third quarter of '06 to reflect that event. You'll note that the thirdquarter of 2006 benefited from the gain of our Alberta Oil Sands sale and thesales of Martabe project in Indonesia and that's the $193 million that you seein parenthesis for Q3 '06. So, again a strong quarter, butclearly, as Dick alluded to earlier, the $0.88 is not sustainable when you havea look at the gains that we have reflected here, in particular the twohighlighted on this, and the fact that Batu had an outstanding quarter and I'llspeak to that in a little more detail. For the quarter we soldapproximately 1.3 million ounces of gold and when we look at the portfolio as awhole, our production was essentially in line with our initial outlook. On slide12 and 13, we will be presenting a different view of our results from whatyou've historically seen and we will compare this quarter's results not onlywith the third quarter of '06, which has been a traditional comparison, butalso with our internal outlook for the year which we communicated to you at thebeginning of the year in the form of our Q1 guidance. Quite frankly, in my view, thecomparison with the prior year is less meaningful, particularly in our industrygiven grades strip ratios and other mine plan changes that most of you on thecall are intimately familiar with and I will be focused on comparing ourinternal results for the third quarter with what we told you at the beginningof 2007. As we look at the third quarterresults for '07 showing here in the green bar compared to our initial outlookfor the third quarter showing in the blue bar. Again the portfolio is generallyperforming as expected. Nevada continues to bea challenge as we work our way through the issues at Phoenix and Midas, that dick alluded toearlier. For the quarter Phoenix was short approximately 27,000 ouncesand Midas was short approximately 28,000 ounces as the operation waseffectively shut down for the quarter. Excluding Phoenixand Midas Nevadais largely performing in line with expectations. Though we are substantially lowerthan the year ago quarter Yanacocha is performing as expected and is actuallydoing a great job transitioning to lower production. In Australia beside from the adverseimpact of the Aussie dollar we had a good quarter and exceeded productionexpectation. The KCGM operation continues to be an area of concern and wecontinue to work through issues and potential solutions to that with our jointventure partner Barrack. At Batu Hijau in Indonesiaour production is right on target on a 100% basis and when you look at equityproduction after adjusting for the effects of our reduction in our economicinterest that we reported to the market in Q2. The significant increase fromlast year's production was driven by both higher grade and higher throughput,as we were in the bottom of the pit and not only did we have higher grade andrecovery, but that's after all we were able to process additional throughputfor the quarter. At Ahafo in Ghana we remain slightly aboveexpectations, as we continue to benefit from higher power availability from thegrid and slightly higher grades than what we had modeled. Moving to slide 13, a similarformat here and again I will focus more on the initial guidance in blue versuswhat we actually did in green for the quarter and the comparative number forthe year ago quarter, that information will be provided at ad nauseum in the10-Q. For the quarter CAS was $388 perounce which was an increase of 22% from the year ago quarter. Beside from theprevious mentioned challenges in Nevada andthe FX rate in Australia,we are generally in line with our original outlook for the year as the bars onthis chart will attest to. The challenges we face and quite frankly thechallenges the industry face is that our assets are maturing. Grades arefalling and stripping continues to increase as open pits mature. This coupledwith the inflation in labor, diesel and other consumables is adverselyimpacting costs. Nevadacosts for the reasons discussed previously are above expectations, the impactof Phoenix wasapproximately $15 per ounce in 2003 or $23 an ounce for the year-to-date minersshutdown impacted CAS through the fact that it produces significantly lowerthan average cost ounces by about $3 per ounce in the quarter, so not a hugeimpact. Yanacocha continues to performaccording to plan and has done an outstanding job managing costs in a verychallenging environment. Keep in mind that in 2007 Yanacocha will moveessentially the same amount of material for approximately 38% less ounces thanwe saw in 2006. Australiaand New Zealand is outsideof our original outlook as the Aussie and New Zealand dollars continue toappreciate. Our initial outlook for the Aussie was based on $0.75. While wehave started a disciplined Aussie dollar hedging program we are essentiallyfully exposed to the Australian dollar for the remainder of the year. For the quarter the strongerAustralian dollar increased CAS by about $49 an ounce so not an insignificantincrease. On an Aussie dollar basis, however the region is actually underbudget when you look at it in Aussie terms we had a budget of 607 for thequarter and we actually delivered $573 dollars Australian so positive FX issuesaside. Batu Hijau exceeded our originaloutlook as we access more of the higher grade portion of the ore body in thethird quarter. As we had communicated previously the third quarter at Batu isgenerally our strongest, given the fact that we are in the bottom of the pitand are able to deliver more high grade softer ore to the mill. As the rainy season approachesand we are forced to retreat from the pit bottom, we increase our stripping andprocess lower grade ores in stock piles. So in short we want to see anotherquarter like this one at Batu for a while. Our first costs were better thanexpected due to the increase in production discussed earlier and favorablepower costs. There is no question that we must continue to focus our costcontainment efforts, but all things considering our operations generallyperformed in line with our original expectations set at the beginning of theyear despite significantly high oil prices in Australian dollar now approachingparity with the U.S. dollar. That's the bad, if you want thegood is that the higher costs are now more than offset by higher gold price,which is translating in to increased margin as Dick showed earlier on the slidewith margins. The weak U.S. dollar while herding in respect with CAS is helpingin that as a key factor driving the gold price higher and resulting in netmargin expansion discussed earlier. With that I am going to turn itover to Guy Landsdown for an update on our project executions.
Guy Landsdown: Thanks Rus, and good day toeverybody. Leading to project execution the construction of our wholly-owned 200megawatt coal-fired power plant is approximately 82% complete and continues tobe on schedule for start up around the middle of 2008. Project's capital costestimates remains at between $620 and $640 million. All significant contractsincluding rail, coal and operations and maintenance are substantially complete. When fully operational the powerplant is expected to reduce Nevada'stotal costs applicable to sales by around $25 an ounce. As you can see in thepicture first coal was delivered to the project in September and we arecurrently planning first fire on oil late this year or early next year. Turning our focus now to Peruthe gold mill project of Yanacocha is approximately 85% complete, with capitalcosts remaining on budget between $250 and $270 million. This processingfacility is expected to start up in the first half of 2008 and will have apositive impact in Yanacocha's operating performance as we move in to the nextgeneration of the storied mines life with a processing of high grade oxide andtransitional ores. Shifting our focus to Australia,Boddington remains one of the largest undeveloped mines in the world withsubstantial exploration upside in current gold and copper reserves of around 9million ounces and 840 million pounds respectively. Boddington at present isapproximately 50% complete and remains on schedule. It will start up around theend of 2008 or early 2009. Located only 130 kilometers from Perth, our ability toattract scarce skilled labor to this desirable location has been favorable, atthe same time we are building Boddington. We are also taking innumerable stepsto ensure we maintain a competitive on going operating cost profile. To thatend we find a long term agreement at competitive power costs for the life ofthe project. We are also in the process ofcompleting our definitive estimate to confirm our capital costs including theimpact of escalation and a stronger Australian dollar. This estimate isexpected to be finalized by early 2008 and we will communicate it to you atthat time. Given its scale and the exploration upsides this asset representsthe corner stone of the next generation of our Australian operating portfolio. Shifting our focus to ourdevelopmental assets, our Conga copper, gold coal free project, locatedapproximately 80 kilometers from the Yanacocha in Peru is one of our more advanceddevelopment opportunities. Equity reserves at Conga currently stand atapproximately 6 million ounces of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper. Todate we have continued discussions with the local community and the permitting processwith the goal of making a development decision in 2008. Also among our perspectivedevelopment assets our 100% owned Akyem project in Ghana is in the evaluation andoptimization phase. With gold reserves of around 8 million ounces we continueto work towards the development of this project with a watchful eye on thepower situation in Ghana and anticipate making a development decision on thisproject in 2008 as well. It's a brief overview of ourdevelopmental project with that I will hand it back to Dick 
Richard O'Brien: As I have emphasized sinceassuming my current role we recognized that we can't change the mature profileof our asset base overnight nor can we change it by simply focusing only on ourinternal initiatives and projects. As a result we continue to take a fresh lookat exploration development and growth opportunities across the globe. We're evaluating prospects thatmight have been considered too small or situated in potentially challenginglocations historically. This slide shows, as part ofthese efforts we recently agreed to offer to acquire all of the outstandingcommon shares of Miramar Mining for Canadian $6.25 cash per share. Our robustlyvalued offer reflects among other things a premium that affords Miramar shareholders of the friendly transaction that isfully and unanimously supported by Miramar's Board of Directors and its seniormanagement. The offering circular will bemailed today and subject to satisfaction or waive of applicable conditionsincluding investment in Canadaapproval. We could begin to take up deposited shares on December 6th. This investment provides us anopportunity to establish a new core mining district in Canada with strong explorationpotential. Leveraging new mines technical and financial resources with theoutstanding were completed today by the Miramarteam. We believe we are best positioned to maximize the true potentials of Hope Bayassets. Once the transaction is finalizedin early 2008, we'll review all of the technical data within the context of ourstage-gate process and determine which development decision is best for therelevant stakeholders. In addition as we announced onJuly 5th, we plan to monetize components of our royalty portfolio preferablylater this year, to a dual track process to maximize for our shareholders torealized value of our discontinued merchant banking portfolio. To-date theinterest in these assets through both tracks and the associated values havebeen robust, with potential alternatives including a possible public offeringand/or private sales transactions. We will continue to work this dual trackprocess hard. We'll anticipate and identify the best options for ourshareholders before the end of this year. As I have indicated before weintend to apply the proceeds from the value realized through this process, tofund, the development and growth of our gold business. We could not have pickeda better and more opportune time to sell these assets. In closing I'd like to thank youfor your interest in our company and for taking the time to listen to our calltoday. With the completion of our early initiatives over the last four months,they have been full but there's only been four of them. We have created theworld's premier fully unhedged gold producer with a renewed focus on our goldbusiness. As we now turn our attention tothe end of 2007 in to our future I feel very fortunate for a number of things;first we have had a successful third quarter. Second we are beginning torealize the value of not putting the accelerator to the floor every fourthquarter. Look for more levelized production from this company going forward inthe future. Third a rich talented group ofemployees who support me and support the company in what we are doing. Andlastly a very rich asset base and a Board who supports us moving forward withthat asset base to make this company the best gold company in the world. Next chapter in our company'slong and established history we will continue to emphasize operational andproject execution as well as gold price leverage and a renewed approach toreplacing our reserves through exploration and business development. Inaddition, we are more committed than ever to leveraging our scope, scale andstandardized processes, to open new doors for growth, cost efficiency andincreased effectiveness across every one of our global operations. With these strategic foundationsclearly established, we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead forthis company. It's upon these foundations that we engage with confidence in ourefforts to continue to rebuild Newmont as the gold company of choice and inturn we realize its our responsibility to earn your trust everyday throughconsistency, commitment, communication and execution. And with that, let me open thecall up for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Ourfirst question comes from John Bridges with JP Morgan. Your line is open sir.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Hi, Dick, everybody. I wonder ifyou can give us a better guidance as to the scale of the copper operation thatyou envisage, just sort of ballpark estimate so we can at least put somethinginto our model?
Russell Ball: Yeah. John, we are still early inthe stage-gate process and it's depending on cutoff. It can be anyway from 50to 150 million tons, which is what we are looking at right now.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay. And what sort of grade ofcopper are you looking at in there?
Russell Ball: It's about a 0.2 to 0.25 plus orminus. Again, a function of cutoff capital costs and when we said it, we have anumber of people focused on that right now. The beauty of this operation andthis opportunity John is right now a lot of that oxide is what's causing us theproblem as we treat some of those ores, because of the lack of flexibilityright now in the mine plan. And then in long term those times will have to getmoved anyway so we are able to convert waste if you want into revenueproducing. So there is some nice synergy the issue for us quite frankly in thecritical pop is most operations will go to permitting and we're through theEIAs with the BLM and the relevant authorities out there.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay great any sort for ordermagnitude on the CapEx, what are talking sort of $50 million, $100 million orsomething?
Russell Ball: Of the order of $150 million to$300 million 
John Bridges - JP Morgan: So, inflation comes again.
Richard O'Brien: John, I'd just say it's stillearly days on this project lot of work to be done on it. I just think in thelight of keeping you informed on Phoenixwe felt it was important to let you know, that there is this opportunity outthere, it's several years away but we'll keep informed when we make progress.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: I appreciate that the numbers arefuzzy, but just wanted to get something. And just as a follow-up on Ahafo. Thecost there have the costs been sort of abnormally high because the stripping isgoing to come down or what sort of strip ratio should we expect going forward?
Russell Ball: John, just trying to normalize,what we had in the big quarter last year remember we started this up in thethird quarter last year.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Yeah.
Russell Ball: So we had commercial production;we were capitalizing those initial mining costs.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay.
Russell Ball: The costs last year wereartificially low as we only charged and effect the incremental costs throughCAS until we reached commercial production. The stripping in Ghana againwith the deferred stripping accounting is going to move and be pretty variablegoing forward, given the number of pits in that operation. It's a string ofpearls if you want on necklace, as opposed to one large pit. So as you get intonew pits you may have some deferred stripping and capitalization, so it's goingto really going to move around over the life of that project. And again, we canget you through John's groups, some of the stripping numbers for the quarterand you can have a look there. But don't consider Q3 '06 as indicative becauseagain we were able to capitalize some of those startup costs until commercialproduction.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay, how do I get to anindicative number, can you tell me what the strip ratio was in three, and whatwe should look forward…?
Russell Ball: Well, John, we'll get you that.We have the numbers for the quarter in the attachments. We will get you toJohn's groups and look at posted on the website on the deferred strippingnumbers or the strip ratios if you want.
John Bridges - JP Morgan: Okay excellent, congratulationson the quarter, and I am really forward to Q4.
Russell Ball: Thanks, John
Operator: Our next question comes fromOscar Carbera with Goldman Sachs
Oscar Carbera - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, gentlemen;congratulations on the results. Dick, this is related to your management team.We have talked about, in the past, about the hiring of a COO and adding to thecore team at Newmont. Just wondering what those plans are now, the fact thatthe operations are, some of them appeared to be reaching a point where theirstabilizing is very encouraging. But how you guys are thinking in terms of justbuilding forward as you get, Boddington and you saw there are opportunities.That's the first one; I'll follow up another one?
Richard O'Brien: Thanks, Oscar, for your question.As I mentioned at the Denvergold show, I clearly realized that as CEO, I can't put in 24 hours a day, andeven if I could, we need some additional operating strength in the company. Oneof the five priority task that we have for this year is to get the organizationstructure right by the end of this year. An acknowledgement in that organizationstructure is twofold. One, we need additional operating strength--but not justat the COO level, but at almost every level in the company. Like a lot of othermining companies, we are competing for the best talent and we are finding itdifficult and we are also being poached of some of our best talent. With respect to the COO inparticular, my senior leadership team, which is composed of 11 folks have allagreed that the company needs to get the chief operating officer or someonethat looks like that and has that responsibility and we are all over that. Thetiming of that really is only reflective of how long it takes to attract theright person and get him into the company. We want to make sure we havesomebody that fits the concept that I have for running this company, which iswholly oriented towards the company and towards team performance and it mighttake us a bit to find somebody. But we are going to find the right person andthey will help take the operations to another level and I acknowledge what yousaid that some of the companies operations have reached a bit more stability.There is no question that we are in a challenging industry environment and weneed to continue to stretch our capacity and capabilities.
Oscar Carbera - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, Dick. Now the other thingwas. I was wondering if you can help us put into context--during one of Bonaventure'sconference calls, basically Bonaventure stated that they were maintaining theirguidance for 1.6 million ounces during 2007. How can we think of that projectgoing into 2008, do you still expect the mill or completion of the mill in thesecond of next year and how should we think about the mine ramp up followingthat? Thanks
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, Oscar what I would say iswe continue to stick with the guidance we have put forward in our 10-Klanguage, which basically says we're looking for a stable production over thenext several years. Think of the mill as really bringing forward economicwealth to the company through quicker processing of the oxide ores. It reallydoesn't add tremendous capability on a year-to-year basis in terms ofincremental allowances, it will help on the cost sides some, and it will helpenable us to better process more complex ores later. So there is lots of positives andit's a very positive economic for us, because we are processing these highergrade oxide ores more quickly rather than putting them on the leach. So weclearly have economic benefits but don't think if it as adding incrementalcapacity, think of Yanacocha as stable over the next several years.
Guy Landsdown: Yeah, Oscar I'll sort of add, wehad some guidance out there for a while as Dick alluded to of that 1.6 to 1.8range and again that's just a function of stripping in grade as we mine differentdeposits, so that's the range you should be think of Yanacocha.
Oscar Carbera - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thanks very much 
Russell Ball: Thanks, Oscar.
Operator: Our next question comes fromVictor Flores with HSBC
Victor Flores - HSBC: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon Ihave a question related to a Akyem. It seems from what you are saying thatyou've had another look at this project and I guess perhaps some of the concernthat you had with respect to going ahead with it have dissipated or changed orsomething is going on there. I was hoping that perhaps you could just give us asense of what has changed that's making you I guess a bit more encouragedtowards this project?
Richard O'Brien: I guess, Victor, what I would sayis we're probably as encouraged as we were a year ago. We just continue toflush out the optimal way to develop this deposit. We did some work with theEPA; they asked us several questions, which we've been responding to. In themeantime, we have continued to do our community baseline studies as we moveforward to what an Akyem development might look like. But this is not just about a onehour of fun while gold prices have really gone up so Akyem looks great. This ismore about sustainable commitment to getting value out of Akyem in a form thatwe feel is sustainable. So with that one of the issues we still have is poweravailability around the Akyem and we are still narrowing down the options thatwe have for the particular mine plan to get the best part of the deposit and tomake sure that we can comply with the EPA requirements. So in summary Victor what I wouldsay is we never really lost the confidence in the project. What we've reallysaid is where the power situation makes it difficult. The increase andinflation both on capital and operating costs requires us to go back andexamine what our return profile looks like and in that we will continue to goforward with the right way to take this feasibility study towards. And what weare really saying is we are going to communicate that to you next year.
Victor Flores - HSBC: That's great thanks and if Icould just ask a follow up on Hope Bay. The folks from Miramar have put out afeasibility that looks at a fairly small project and obviously you are lookingat this as a much bigger project. They had talked at one point in time about acouple of scenarios involving both a large scale open pit operation with someunderground and then a fully underground scenario as well. What do you think ofthose particular scenarios or how are you looking at this project?
Richard O'Brien: As you can imagine, the interestwe've held and currently hold in Miramar,we are very close to what they are doing from an operational perspective. Wecontinue to look at the plans that they put on the table, provide them sometechnical advise around that and I would say that at the end of the day Miramarand us, we see exactly the same thing there, which is the long-term perspectiveat greenstone belt and what we are really trying to do is to optimize what's thebest way to get started. I don't have the answer to thattoday nor does our technical team, but when we take ownership of this we willlook at the plans they currently have. We evaluate those in the context of whatelse we could do and we will make a decision. But I think it's clear that what Miramar has on the tableworks. The question for us, is there something that might work better, we arenot in a position to answer that today.
Victor Flores - HSBC: That's fine. I understand that.Just let me ask one final question. When do you think that you will have asense of how to develop Hope Bay?
Richard O'Brien: Well, clearly we are going tohave a little bit of winter time here when we can think about it and we willcomeback.
Victor Flores - HSBC: A long winter up there.
Richard O'Brien: Yeah.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Yeah.
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, and that's when we're goingto hold the mine to or for everybody too.
Victor Flores - HSBC: Great, I will send my associates.Thank you.
Richard O'Brien: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from JohnHill with Citi.
John Hill - Citigroup: Yes. Thanks, everyone, and thanksfor the detail on the call. I was just wondering if you could update us. Wherewe are at in terms of Phoenixrecoveries, and then secondarily on that, why so long to get the crusher onsit?This was supposedly a priority when we visited the site in September of 2006?
Guy Landsdown: I can talk to the crusher, John.The crushers schedule is driven primarily by the delivery time on the crusheritself and as a result that we'll have it onsite towards the first or secondquarter of next year.
Richard O'Brien: With respect to the firstquestion with respect to recovery, grade, processing all of those things Johnare things that we will answer in more detail when we have the definitive mineplan coming up next year. In the mean time what we are seeing is moreefficiency in what we do. As I said, I think fragmentation has lead to a littleeasier processing both through the crusher and into the mill. The mill as anymill startup you know that we're still in a period where Phoenix is not even on for a year, so we arestill working through some of those issues, but the mill is operating betterthan it has historically. We continue to see more availability, but withrespect to recoveries mill or grade or the rest of that we will continue toprovide more details as we get into next year.
Russell Ball: John, Russ for the quarter wewere somewhere between 65 and 70.
John Hill - Citigroup: Okay great and then if one of youcould just branch off and talk a little bit about the merchant banking assets.There has been some discussion early on that gold, assets, gold, leveragedassets and royalties would be cheaper, now it appears that potentially the goldstrike royalty is going. I was just wondering whether that's correct and whatexactly we would plan to invest and that's going to be more sort of goldexposed and unique and long-term in the world of gold and that royalty?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, I guess with respect tothat we have been pretty definitive in almost every presentation we made thatwe were selling the royalty portfolio. When you look at the royalty portfolioyou are right, gold strike is in that portfolio, as well as exposure to oil,palladium, copper, base metals any number of other things. When we sell theportfolio obviously we are trying to get the biggest dollar value that we can.Gold strike helps with that, so I think its absolute key component to where weare going forward. Where we are going to reinvest? Well, we have a number ofopportunities inside our own portfolio in a way you could think of ourreinvestment in to Miramar. Our job is really to operate goldmines and I'm definitive about that. We are going to operate, our job in somerespects, the carry over activity out of Newmont capital that we will continueto look at, is looking into junior companies that have exposure to gold, wherewe can find things in the earlier stage. Gold strike, not one of those, so aswe look forward, look for us to find earlier opportunities, opportunities thatwe believe have upsides and opportunities that come to us with operating goldexposure, that's our deal.
John Hill - Citigroup: Okay, very clearly stated,. Thenif I could just quickly…how do we plan to stamp seasonality out of the Nevada system, that'sbeen a pretty long standing feature, year in and year out?
Richard O'Brien: It's a good question; we will notstamp it out in any one year--there will be something we'll have to do overtime, but you have my management team's word on it. It's something we are goingto work through. Now, part of the variability, we have is seasonal right? But Nevada is not one of those generally, but in Nevada we do have tomanage through the many processing plans that we have, making sure that we bothfuel them as well as get the processing through them. So there is a little bit about,we shut down during the second quarter, we'll always do that, but I think withrespect to trying to levelise between the others, we are going to try to workharder to get that done. I would say, come back to us at the end of 2010 andsay, hey, you've done a great job, flattening this out, its going to take us abit to get there but we're going to get there.
John Hill - Citigroup: Got it, thanks
Russell Ball: John, Russ. Sorry, let me justadd something. As we've gone through a change in our planning horizon,historically, Newmont had planned on a calendar basis or a twelve year basis,four months sorry. And that had driven behaviors, but we have gone out for thisplanning cycle, which, again, we're right in the midst of that we'llcommunicate to the Board in the middle of December and to The Street inJanuary, February timeframe, is what we are asking our operators to do is to giveus a three-year plan that they can deliver on. So extending that time horizonto three years reduces that incentive to make this year look good by stealingfrom next year, which is not a particularly unique trait for Newmont. So I think part of it is behavior-driven.And as we look to the regions to deliver on the three-year plan, '08 to '10, inline with the mission and vision that we have communicated internally andexternally, I think you will see a change in behavior.
Richard O'Brien: And one quick indicator of thatmight be if you look to the fourth quarter of this year or next year to seewhat sort of inventory we might be carrying over into the next year, I thinkwe'll try to work through this in a systematic way.
Guy Landsdown: And John, the key for us, quitefrankly, is to look at the portfolio rather than just Nevada. I mean we can obviously look at Nevada and that is thearea that has historically been the one that's had the fourth quarter push. Butwhat we really need to do is to look at the portfolio and balance it across theentire region. For example, Boddington in '09 helpfill some of that gap in the yearend. That's the issue that we have asmanagement to manage around the portfolio just like an analyst or a PM would dowith their portfolio. We need to look at the contribution by region, and thenbalance that. And it needs to be for a longer time period maybe than we've donehistorically.
John Hill - Citigroup: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from MarkSmith with Dundee Securities.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Yeah, hi. I guess this questionis mainly for Russell. Maybe you could help me a little bit with some of themovements of deferred taxes on the balance sheet and how that reflected to thequarter? You had about $300 million added to deferred tax assets in the period?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, Mark. As we alluded toearlier, the tax calculation is pretty complex and we have a number of movingparts. What we will commit to is through John to get you a greater breakdown onthe tax calculation, including the split between current and deferred taxes. Asyou've seen, we had some significant movements negative in the second quarter,if you want, through the income statement and then positives. We'll get youthat through John. And again, we can get that posted up on the website. I think the key going forward forfolks to realize is the 32% number. And yeah, you will see movement both intodeferred and current in and around that. But for the long-term, as we see it todaywith the assets and attributes we have, 32 is a good number for a tax basis formodeling purposes. We will get you more detail when you need through John'sgroup.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay, good. Just following upthat a little just a little bit, you had $125 million in payable and in theoperating cash flow line. Is that a reasonable number to go below the line goforward?
Richard O'Brien: Yeah, Russ. You have to be alittle careful. Remember that those payments are lagging.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Yeah. But there is not a big lagcoming, right?
Russell Ball: And a lot of the tax paymentsthat we make on the consolidated basis are coming out at Yanacocha. So withthat profile coming down, it will look different going forward. So again, we'llget something to you that give you an indicative number, at least, based on thecurrent asset that you can plug.
Mark Smith - Dundee Securities: Okay. Thank you very much, sir
Russell Ball: Take care Mark.
Operator: Our next question comes fromPatrick Chidley with BJM. Your line is open 
Patrick Chidley - BJM: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.Just wanted to ask about your oil prices that you've been experiencing throughthe quarter, have you hedged any oil or would you have been exposed to the spotprice for all of your diesel and what price are you looking for in the fourthquarter? What you are planning for in terms of your plans?
Russell Ball: Patrick, you cut out a littlebit. But I think your question related to any hedging activity around oil, isthat correct?
Patrick Chidley - BJM: Yes, right 
Richard O'Brien: Okay. So I'd just say that wedon't currently hedge oil on an accounting basis. We do have a hedge for oilwith respect to the cash distributions that we receive from Canadian oil sandsand the principal appreciation or depreciation that comes along with thatinvestment. So that's the way to think of it. At this point, we consume about 3million barrels of diesel, 3 million barrels of oil a year. That gives you somerange of the exposure that we have. And relative to that, Canadian oil sandscovers with the distribution that we currently receive about 60% of the upsidein price that we might have related to that. While it doesn't show up on theincome that way, that's generally the way we're hedged.
Russell Ball: And Patrick, rest for '08 budgetassumption at least as of today was $80 oil and tied into that was 87.5 centson the Australian dollar. So that's what we are thinking currently now for '08,again we will assess that before we finalize numbers present to the Board andpresent to you. But clearly, both of those will put cost pressures on CIS. Butagain, the hypothesis is driven by weaker dollar is good from the marginprospective seen in the gold price.
Patrick Chidley - BJM: And your Canadian oil sandsinvestments, do you intend to continue holding that?
Russell Ball: Yeah, we have that, Patrick. Thebook value is roughly just over a billion. We paid about $300 million for thatservice. So as Dick said, a nice gain, it has been a nice hedge that workedthat well. Obviously, we can't book that gain in the hedge from an accountingperspective at least, but it is an economic hedge. As we said earlier, in the thirdquarter we will continue to evaluate that asset. And when the time is right andwe have the opportunity, we will convert that asset into cash and reinvest itin our core gold business. And we've been pretty consistent in tellinginvestors that since the restructuring and reorganization, if you want.
Patrick Chidley - BJM: Okay. Just one more question, ifI may, on Ahafo. You just appear to be warning that ratio below in the fourthquarter, was that because you are not planning to have positive gradereconciliation as I think you talked about in the third quarter or is thatbecause you really think that that's maybe the case?
Russell Ball: Patrick, I think the question wasAhafo and fourth quarter, where you see more certain grade. It's just theimpact of stripping as we move into new pit in new areas. So it's more drivenby the mine plan and the function rather than any negative issues if you wantwith grade.
Patrick Chidley - BJM: More stripping than throughput?
Russell Ball: Yes, exactly. Or more strippingand maybe lower grade. The throughput is largely affixed again. The throughputissue on the power side, which has been the issue, Ghana has improved, the rains havecome and the dam levels are up so, we do expect to generate less powerourselves and more through the grid. However, for those who have been watchingthe power situation in Ghanathere was a public announcement, I think it was this week or it might have beenlast week of rate increases. And obviously that will impact us and we will haveto work that through in the economics on achievements as well.
Patrick Chidley - BJM: Okay. Well, thanks a lot. Welldone and a good quarter.
Russell Ball: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes fromBarry Cooper with CIBC.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Yeah, good day. A few questions.First of all, fairly simple one, maybe, could you explain the drop in thedepreciation rate for Nevada.You basically dropped at $40 amount quarter-on-quarter, about $30 from firsthalf. That seems to be quite a bit for what we would normally consider a stablearea?
Russell Ball: Well, Barry that's good question.We had two things going on. We looked in the second quarter and you'll see thatin our Q where we reassessed assets lives, particularly on the whole fleet. Wehad been using an assumption of I think it was seven years on our largeequipment fleet with some of the improvements in the maintenance function. Wehave extended that to 10.5 year, which is probably equates about 75000 hours ona whole truck round numbers. So that was part of it and therest was in moving with production. Again, the split is about 50-50 and itvaries by region between units of production and on the straight line message.So, again, some of it is the mix of production whether it's coming fromunderground or open pits and affect where we are processing it so. You will seethat for the Company we have backed off on the guidance for DD&A for theyear by about the same number $40 million to $50 million.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Great. Okay. So going forwardwhat you suggest we look at them?
Russell Ball: Yeah. I think, Barry, thisquarter is pretty indicative. Again, we had a lot of production coming out ofbars and that will take some DD&A with it, but so that revised number seemsto be a reasonable estimate as we look forward in the planning process, youknow, with answers around 5.4 million round numbers.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Good. And then on yourother guidance on the copper production 190 million pounds to 210 millionpounds you add 183, I am just wondering, I realized you don't like probablychanging guidance all that much, but that seems to be a pretty slow pitchtheir?
Russell Ball: Sorry, Barry for the year and Iam just looking at the release on page 11 of page 21. We are about 170.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Yeah. Are you quoting sales, orare you quoting production?
Russell Ball: Sales.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Okay. So there's a slightdifference there okay.
Russell Ball: There is a difference, Barry andthat's what Dick alluded to earlier with inventories moving around. And again,we are still currently today in the bottom of the pit; the rains have notcoming in. I don't know if its alumina or lumina, but we still have a shovel inthe pit. So, again, we will look to balance the production throughout theportfolio and that means, you may see some operations sitting on more inventoryat yearend. Again, the next is the function of how long we can access that highgrade in the bottom of that pit.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Then the final question Ihave is, just wondering what your view is, and maybe its not a view, maybe it'sa defensive position that you undertake of the overall, the 1872 Mining Law,where defense are talking about imposing a 4% royalty on all federal land. Howmuch of your production comes off of nonpatented land in Nevada?
Richard O'Brien: This is good for exciting us. Ibelieve that our reserve in Nevada,only 4 million assets are on federal land at this time and our expectation isthat in final bill, you won't see a royalty on existing reserves.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Yeah. I think it will get washeddown to nothing, pretty much by the time, it gets beaten around there.
Richard O'Brien: That's certainly our hope and ourexpectation at this point.
Barry Cooper - CIBC World Markets: Yeah. That would my guess as wellbut you never know sometimes. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Richard O'Brien: Sure
Operator: Our final question comes fromJohn Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is open.
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Independent Research: Congratulations on theimprovement. I've several questions, and maybe you can address some of them.How much output do you expect to get from miners in the fourth quarter first.Second, is it right to assume that part of Miramar's availability was thedifficulty of staffing management and other positions in the far north, andwill there will be more acquisitions where Miramar's ability to bring talentedstaff moves the project along as a unique synergy, and finally in the Phoenixredrilling, what is the data you are looking for. Are you trying to exactlycharacterize ore hardness, oxide mix, sulphide at a vertical character or isthere an uncertainty as to the gold or copper content or some other attribute?
Russell Ball: Right, I will take those John,so, first on Midas. Think of Midas as a 10,000 ounce a month producer. As weramp up during the fourth quarter recognizing that it's already the end ofOctober, at best, we have two months at 10,000 ounces, at best. I would suggestthat we are moving into new ground, new stoping, still trying to get it rightout there. It will come in less than that. But think of it in that range;that's our capability on that same. We will do 20 that is it at the most. So,think of it that way. With respect to Miramar, Miramar was not reallyavailable. Miramar was something that weunderstood the project, we understood the potential of the Green Stone belt,and we just worked with the old, with Miramara company that we had an invested in for sometime. I think they have done apretty extraordinary job of keeping their team focused on drilling, on puttingthe mine plan together. Clearly one of the things that Newmont does bring tothis operation and answer to your sub part to this, I think that Newmont doeshave the capability, the technical capability and other capabilities to reallywork through some of these issues that maybe, some other companies don't have. We also have the balance sheetstrength, and we have a solid base of production that allows us both in Canadaand in other places throughout the world to take some risk. I think that that'sone of the things you give when you buy a major gold company. We can take aheadand we can still keep on taking just like we did with what happened in East Pakistan.  Now I would suggest going forwardwhen I talk about scope and scale benefits. That is exactly the kind of thingthat I hope we can take other places. Does that mean more acquisitions? I don'tknow quite frankly, because if the market gets frothy we are not going to bethere. If the market makes things available that we think makes sense, that wecan do on an accretive basis, that we can do in a way which is respectful ofour shareholders and our, because we all have an investment, the share pricethat we have, we'll consider that, but that's the calculus. It's not just getbigger, it's get better to make sure that we're bringing something to the tablethat we bring a unique aspect that maybe not everybody else does. That we canbring this development into production in a way that brings value to ourshareholders. And lastly, with respect to yoursubpart three question on Phoenix,the data we're looking for is all of that that you suggested. It has to do withsome older drill holes. That's why we receive data on those older drill holes.We're finding that we need to go back and update those drill holes for avariety of reasons, but we are looking for our harness, we are looking formetallurgical content. We are through that drilling, going to continue till welook at the reserve content for copper, gold. All of those things are on thetable at Phoenixright now, and that's precisely why we're going to be drilling these 150 yearsold or so holes over the balance of this year and in the next year. 
John Tumazos - John Tumazos Independent Research: If I could follow-up concerning Phoenix for the first 46 holes suggesting net-net betteror worse data, and concerning Miramar,just cruising their website there were a lot of job openings. It seems likethere were more jobs in management vacant and that may be filled. And I didn'tget the impression they have any material undisclosed with that because it wasall up on the web. So it didn't give the impression like they were going to beon schedule with the small those north ones.  And I would think there must be alot of companies and situations where they can't really stop their projectsthat would be opportunities, not really bidding more situations.
Russell Ball: That could very well be respectto Miramar. Ihaven't had the time to cruise other people's website to see if that's thecase, but we do have a group that keeps their ears to the ground here, so we'llkeep looking for those opportunities. And with respect to Miramar's, as I said,I think we'll work a complimentary process here to keep the people they have toadd our people and move this project forward so that's sort of a last answer tothat, and with respect to Phoenix, again, we've drove those holes. That doesn'tmean we have had time to assay all of them, it doesn't mean we have anyconclusion at this point, still preliminary as we keep saying when we get themine plan together, we will update analysts. So with that, I want to thankeverybody for their attention today, and again, if you other questions, JohnSeaberg and the IR team would be happy to follow up with you. Thanks again.

Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded. If you have objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'll turn the meeting over to your host today, Mr. John Gaensbauer. Sir, you may begin.
John Gaensbauer: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on Newmont's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Please note that this call and presentation are being simulcast today on our website at www.newmont.com and are available for playback for a limited time. On today's call, as you may seen, we have some recent management appointments that the slide doesn't reflect. We do have Wayne Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Pierre Lassonde, President; Richard O'Brien, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Enos, Executive Vice President, Operations. On today's call Wayne will cover our third quarter financial highlights, Dick will review the performance at our operating regions, Tom will give us an update on our capital projects, and Pierre will cover merchant banking and give us his thoughts on the gold market. We will be discussing forward-looking information that involve unique risks to our industry that we described in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you, John and good afternoon, everybody. During the third quarter, we continued to generate earnings growth and gold price leverage for our shareholders. Our net income grew to $198 million or $0.44 per share compared to $126 million or $0.28 per share for the third quarter of last year. For the year-to-date net income grew to $568 million from $260 million in the same period last year, an increase of over 100%. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our development pipeline. Ahafo reached commercial production in August after a successful startup on first gold pour in July. In Nevada, we expect our Leeville and Phoenix projects to reach commercial production during the fourth quarter. Our investment in these new mines will form the base on which to grow our business in the years to come. And as we discussed in September, we also expect to grow our reserves, net of depletion again this year, and Pierre will talk to that a little later. Turning back to the financial highlights again, net income was $198 million for the quarter on revenues of $1.1 billion, and we sold $1.7 million consolidated ounces of gold at an average realized price of $615 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were higher than the year ago quarter. Unfortunately, as has been the theme for the whole industry, primarily due to lower production and increased costs at Yanacocha, but remain competitive at $318 per ounce. I would refer you to this morning's press release for a description of the various items impacting net income for the quarter, but of note, as previously announced, we sold our oil sands leases in our Martabe project in the Indonesia, generating after-tax gains of $193 million in the third quarter. These gains were partially offset by the write-off of our remaining investment in Zarafshan-Newmont joint venture in Uzbekistan, as a result of the Uzbek government's expropriation -- expropriation is a for fancy work for stealing of the asset earlier this year. We have filed a case against Uzbek government in international arbitration and will seek to recover our investment and our lost profits. In the third quarter, we also extinguished roughly 160,000 ounces of prepaid forward gold deliveries scheduled for June '07 at a cost of $26 million. With that I will turn the microphone over to Dick to discuss our operating results in a little more detail.
Richard O'Brien: Thank, Wayne. We have had a good quarter in the third quarter producing 569,000 consolidated ounces at costs applicable to sales of $428 per ounce. On an equity basis third quarter gold sales were equivalent to the year ago quarter. Gold sales also increased over second quarter levels. Cost applicable to sales increased 20% from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher labor, energy and consumable costs. Costs were also impacted by this year's change in accounting for stripping costs, which reduced costs applicable to sales by $25 per ounce in the third quarter of 2005. For the year, we expect Newmont to produce between 2.31 and 2.36 million equity ounces at costs applicable to sales between 380 and 395 per ounce as both costs and grades improve in the fourth quarter. At Yanacocha in Peru, gold sales were 578,000 consolidated ounces in the quarter at costs applicable to sales of $210 per ounce. As projected, gold sales decreased 25% from the year ago quarter due to fewer tons places on the leach pads and lower grades. Costs applicable to sales for the third quarter increased 46% per ounce as a result of a lower production and higher striping and labor costs. During the third quarter, Yanacocha recorded a $19 million charge related to a negotiated royalty arrangement reached with Peruvian government to provide additional funds for community improvement during this period of higher metal price. Payment is based on 3.75% of net income beginning January 1, 2006 and continuing for a period of up to five years. For the year, we expect Yanacocha to produce between 1.33 and 1.37 million equity ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $200 and $210 per ounce. In Australia and New Zealand, the company sold 355,000 consolidated ounces at costs applicable to sales of 376 per ounce. Third quarter consolidated gold sales decreased 6% from the year ago quarter. At the Tanami operations, we had lower mill throughput than the year-ago quarter, when we were processing Groundrush stockpiles. At Kalgoorlie, we experienced harder and more abrasive ore compared to the same quarter 2005. In addition the roaster was down for planned maintenance in the third quarter. At Pajingo, we mill 9% fewer tons than the year ago quarter as a result of ground control issues at Vera South Deeps and slower than planned at access at Jandam. Mill throughput at Martha was also lower as we transition from open-pit underground mining there. The lower production, however, was partially offset by higher grades at Tanami, Jundee and Martha. Costs applicable to sales increased 17%, primarily due to the lower production rates, higher royalties and the change in accounting for stripping, which lowered 2005 costs by $7 per ounce. For the year, we expect Australia and New Zealand to produce between 1.37 and 1.4 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between 380 and 395 per ounce. Batu Hijau had consolidated sales of 90 million pounds of copper and 59,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $0.73 per pound of copper and $286 per ounce of gold. Production at Batu continues to be impacted by lower copper and gold grades as well as lower mill throughput, due to harder ores. Costs applicable to sales were also higher than the year ago quarter due to the lower production and lower grades. For the year, we expect Batu Hijau to produce between 185,000 and 200,000 equity ounces of gold and 215 and 230 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of between $200 and $225 per ounce of gold and $0.70 to $0.75 per pound of copper. As we indicated in our press release, production is expected to remain at approximately these levels through 2009, primarily as a result of the mine plan resequencing and the hardness for the ore. We are however, currently evaluating additional grinding capacity to increase throughput at the mill. In Ghana, the Ahafo mine commenced commercial production in August after a successful start-up in July. Gold sales for the quarter were 77,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of $251 per ounce. Operations continue to be impacted by nationwide power shortages due to low water levels serving Ghana's hydroelectric facilities. We are in the process of installing additional diesel generating capacity at the site and along with our industry peers exploring other long-term lower cost alternatives. Costs applicable to sales for the balance of this year and next are expected to be continue to be impacted by the power shortages. For the year, Ahafo is expected to produce between 160,000 and 195,000 ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $260 and $290 per ounce. Now I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss project development.
Tom Enos: Thanks Dick. As Wayne mentioned, our Leeville underground project in Nevada is now operating at the targeted 2,100 tons per day rate for 2006 and is expected to achieve commercial operation status in the fourth quarter. We have completed the first materials handling system and are hoisting ore through the production shaft. We remain on track to attain targeted production rates of 3,200 tons per day by the end of 2007. At the open-pit Phoenix project in Nevada, we also expect to achieve commercial operation status in the fourth quarter. The mill has achieved its design production rate and was operating at a rate of 3,100 tons per day at the end of October. We continue to optimize the plant to increase recovery rates and are evaluating installation of a new crusher to address unexpected ore hardness. We are also progressing steady of a copper oxide leach program to potentially expand the scope of the Phoenix project. Also in Nevada, our 200-megawatt power plant remains on schedule for completion in 2008. Capital costs at the plant are now expected to be between $610 million and $640 million in part due to higher labor and commodity prices and purchases of railcars and track upgrades. At the Boddington project in Australia, construction is approximately 11% complete with initial production expected in late 2008 or early 2009. At Yanacocha, construction of the gold mill is under way with anticipated start-up in 2008. Finally, as we announced in September, we have delayed the construction of the Akyem project in Ghana, pending completion of permitting, resolution of the power shortages there and optimization of project economics. Now let me turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre Lassonde: Yeah, estimated royalty and other income for this year 2000 -- sorry I didn’t have my microphone on. Thanks Tom. We will start it all over again. Newmont Capital is having another record year. The royalty and other income for this year is now estimated at over $105 million and as you all know our target originally four years ago, five years ago was to be over the $100 million and we've now achieved that target and surpassed it. Not only that, but in this quarter, we booked over $300 million of pre-tax gains from sale of non-core asset. The major sales was the Alberta heavy oil, our Black Gold property, in which we had an investment of $20 million that we sold for a net proceed of US $280 million. We've taken some of that money back and put it back into buying our next acorn, as I call them, and that's $152 million investment in the FALC JV with Shore Gold, in which we purchased a 40% interest. And on that investment so far, this year over 200 PQ holes have been completed, totaling over 50,000 meters and on the Orion Cluster, in particular, and what we're finding is that the kimberlites are larger than originally thought, particularly on Orion North and South. And six new feeder vents were discovered during the 2006 program, which all bodes well. It's a very early stage, again, exploration program, but it's certainly one that is very attractive for Newmont. I will turn over to the gold market update very quickly. What we see here in the US, I call them the US economic factors that we are now entering the mid-cycle slowdown and it is going to become more pronounced next year. The third quarter this year, of course, was 1.6% and I think it's going to probably slow down from here on. The next important point is we believe that inflation has peaked. However, it's likely to stay at a much higher level than what the Fed, I think, is intimating. What we're seeing, certainly in our industry and other industry, is labor settlements are coming in at a higher level and that is feeding through the chain. I think you're going to see higher rate. So, the choice that the Fed will face at the end of the year is going to be with interest rates, what do they do if they're facing stagflation, and are they going to raise rate and get the US economy into a recession or not? What you can be sure of is that the gold price will anticipate the Fed action and I think what the gold price is saying right today or over the last week is that the Fed will blink and will start to lower rates because it doesn't want to have a recession. So, when you look at the gold market, what we see is in the last quarter, the physical demand has been very, very robust at the jewelry level in particular in India and China, when the gold price came back closer to 5.75, 5.85, very, very robust, physical demand. Mine production is set for a fourth annual decline and it's a reflection, again, of the lack of investment that were made back in the early part of this decade. Another very significant point is central bank selling is abating and in October, for example, Germany announced that it will not sell any gold in the new year of the Washington Agreement which means that for the second year in a row, the 500 tons that is allowed under the WGA, the Washington Agreement, will not be met. It will probably be closer to 300 to 350 tons. And, yet, on the other side, we are seeing central bank -- some central banks starting to buy gold and the whole notion is that we're going to have less gold for sale and higher demand. The gold ETF is now over 544 tons at the end of the month of October. That's an increase of about 40 tons in the last month and it just goes to show the increasing level of investment demand for gold. Considering all of that, our view is that the gold price over the next 12 months could see a downside of possibly 5 or, you know, $20 to $35, something like that, but on the upside, we're thinking that we could very well likely see $700 gold in the next 12 months. And with that, I will turn it over to Wayne.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you, Pierre. We are maintaining our production and cost outlook for the balance of 2006 with annual production of between 5.6 and 5.8 million equity ounces of gold at cost of sales of between $290 and $310 per ounce and between 215 million and 230 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of between $0.70 and $0.75. Capital cost estimates for the year have been increased slightly as a result of the delays in the commercial start-up of Leeville and Phoenix. We've got higher costs at Ahafo and the changes in estimate for the power plant. As I said at the beginning of the call, we're focused on making steady progress in the ramp-up of these three new operations and as we advance them toward steady state production levels. In the meantime, our net income and operating margins have continued to grow at rates faster than the gold pours. Our unit operating margin grew almost 50% for the first nine months. With our production weighted to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to generate expanding margins and earnings leverage to gold prices over the balance of the year. I'd also like to make note that we put out a release -- organizational announcement release after the close of the market today. We concluded a Board meeting and in this announcement you will note that Pierre is going to change his role within the company. He's going to move to a part-time status, but will continue to be very involved in the strategy and the direction of the company. I think you will continue to hear his prognostications on the gold price as we move forward. When we formed this partnership five years ago, I think initially we called it a trial and we're going to work together for a couple of years. That has continued to -- to go on and we expect that to continue for some number of years in the future. However, as part of the transition and management's succession plan, we have promoted Dick O'Brien, Tom Enos, Britt Banks and David Harquail to Executive Vice Presidents and Sharon and Steve Enders and Darla Caudle to Senior Vice Presidents. We will continue to increase their responsibilities in the coming years and look forward to getting back to a growth mode in this company next -- after next year and we see tremendous leverage because of the gold price and because of, once again, beyond 2007, we will start to see real unit growth. With that, I think we'll turn the call over to the operator and provide you all with opportunities to ask questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). First question, Mr. John Bridges of JP Morgan.
John Bridges: Hi. Morning -- afternoon, everybody. Pierre, could you fill us a little bit on the central banks? Your comment on the reduced sales? Because I thought that you were still out on exactly what was sold this year to September.
Pierre Lassonde: John, the number that we have at the WGC is that the sales for last year were only about 352 tons. And for next year, 2007, I guess our view is that it's going to be broadly similar because Germany is not coming in with their 200 tons, so, probably someone else will step up a little bit, but even that is questionable because some of the other countries are starting to back down, as well. So that's where things are at this point.
John Bridges: Because there was some questions about metal would have been sold forward and not exercised or something like that?
Pierre Lassonde: Well, even if they sell forward, at some point it comes in -- you know, on the quarterly basis, they have to report so it comes in and we certainly haven't seen anything of that nature.
John Bridges: Okay. And a quick mining question on Martha. Just could you give us a bit of guidance as to what that's turning into? Wasn't that then you have taken it into an underground, is it a mix of underground and surface going forward? Or what can we expect?
Pierre Lassonde: Tom Enos will answer.
Tom Enos: Actually, we're doing a layback there in the surface mine, as well as an underground development.
John Bridges: Okay. So, what can we expect going forward? Is it going to be a mix? Will the layback last just a year or something?
Tom Enos: Yes, it is. It will be a mix. The layback lasts three years?
John Bridges: Okay. And then the mine itself? What do you expect from that?
Pierre Lassonde: Well, there's approximately over 100,000 ounces that are going to come out of the mine a year.
John Bridges: Okay. And what sort of life do you expect from it?
Pierre Lassonde: Gee, the way things have been going there in New Zealand, I'm not sure what we've got in the plan.
Wayne Murdy: We'd have to get back to you on that, John, but basically -- basically what happened there is we thought we were at the end of the life of the open pit and we're transitioning to all underground and we found some -- some additional ore that looks real good at the bottom of the pit. It will require the southern layback. We had to remove some surface -- I want to say facilities, but that's not the right term. Some historic surface facilities --
Pierre Lassonde: Historic pump house.
Wayne Murdy: Yeah, historic pump house and that's now been moved and so we started this additional layback, but it does extend the life of the mine, but the underground is like all underground. I mean we've just drilled it out for the next few years, but we think they will continue to be a relatively long life there.
John Bridges: Okay. It was a pleasant surprise anyway. I just wanted to see what to model. Thank you.
Wayne Murdy: Yep.
Operator: Next question from Mr. Michael Dudas of Bear Stearns.
Michael Dudas: Good afternoon, everybody. My question addressed to maybe for Tom. Could you expand a little bit more on the outlook for Batu Hijau, what are you thinking about relative to your crusher opportunities? And what could possibly come through in evaluating different alternatives to possibly improve the output or better mill throughput of that operation as you put forth in 2009.
Tom Enos: We currently are doing a study on additional grinding, which will probably amount to a -- a third sag line, so we'll be complete with really an evaluation of what it's going to take to get it permitted by mid-next year and make a decision from there.
Michael Dudas: Fair enough. And maybe Dick could go over the roll-off of the copper hedges for us again and how that's going to play through?
Richard O'Brien: What we've said previously is that we anticipate the copper hedges will come off in the first quarter with about a quarter of the production in the first quarter subject to hedges on a financial basis.
Michael Dudas: And then subsequent to that? You will have --
Richard O'Brien: Subsequent to that, we have no additional hedges outstanding at -- we will be out of our copper hedges.
Michael Dudas: My final question for Pierre. There's been pretty heavy buyback opportunities from the producer side this year. How much of an impact do you think that's had on the gold market this year? And if we don't get similar-type situations, unless we get a pretty strong spike in gold price, is that going to be somewhat hurtful if we get a little bit more concern about the disinflation or deflation?
Pierre Lassonde: The sensitivity of gold to -- to the tonnage, it's about 7 -- $7 to $10 per hundred tons. And this year, if you look at the total amount of gold bought back by Barrick and the others and minus the new hedging by other producer, it's probably going to be in the order of 250 tons or so. So, you could be looking at $15 to $25, somewhere in that range. And then add another 150 tons from the central banks or closer to 200, probably, that's another 14 -- $14, $15 to $25. But again, next year, you know, total worldwide production will be down again. So, whether or not the de-hedging next year will be at the same level, probably not. Probably a bit less. But you're only talking, you know, $7 to $15, in my mind, on the gold price of over $600. So, it's not -- it's 2%. It's not that material. I think the total level of demand is far more important. And you just look at the gold ETF, it's close to 300 tons -- the gold ETF was launched two years ago, November 14, and it's almost 550 tons over two years. I mean that's real, real, new, heavy demand. And we think it's going to continue. We just listed the gold ETF in Singapore. It's going to be listed on Hong Kong in not too long. We're looking at listings in Tokyo and Dubai, new listings in India. And the WGC, you know, we're going to circle the world with the gold ETF and create even more demand.
Michael Dudas: Pierre, you're quite busy with some other things going on. Congratulations.
Pierre Lassonde: Thank you.
Operator: The next question from Mr. Victor Flores, HSBC.
Victor Flores: Thanks. I have a couple of questions this afternoon. First of all, with respect to Leeville, you noted that the production shaft is now operational at about 2100 tons a day. My understanding is that in order to get production up to the levels you want -- and you have to get the backfill plant in. My understanding is that the backfield production is around 1500 tons a day. Where are you with respect to the backfill? And is that one of the items that's keeping you from producing at a higher level? And when will that come through?
Pierre Lassonde: Actually the -- the next ramp-up phase is another ore pass that will take the tonnage to the design of 3200 tons a day. Currently we have the ability to hoist through the ventilation shaft and we are hoisting some of our backfill material through there now. So the -- the plan is to have the other ore pass in by April of next year.
Victor Flores: Okay, sorry. So, then getting backfield down into the stope is not permitting you at this point in time?
Pierre Lassonde: No, sir, it is not.
Victor Flores: Great, thanks. Second question goes to the voluntary contribution in Peru. Of that 3.75%, has it been established what percentage of that will be managed directly by the company and what percentage will be managed by the government?
Wayne Murdy: No, it has not been established yet.
Victor Flores: Do you have a sense for where that's going to go? Or is there still a bit of horse training around that number?
Wayne Murdy: The latter. Still a bit of horse training.
Victor Flores: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: And the next question from Mr. John Tumazos, Prudential.
John Tumazos: Good afternoon. I missed the press release on the organizational changes. Wayne, I wanted to congratulate you on continuing on. Have you made any commitment as to how many more years to go. I know that 65 is only a technicality when you like the business, could you just review the ages of the different EVPs and Senior VPs and has anyone been designated COO?
Pierre Lassonde: Just before Wayne answered, John, I take it very personally, the way you phrased that question. And you will note that, you know, they had to move four people up to replace me. Okay?
John Tumazos: Pierre, you've got so much money that I don't worry about you.
Pierre Lassonde: Thank you, John. You don't have to advertise it.
Wayne Murdy: Actually the -- I don't know if anybody really looked. I was worried about when this announcement went out, whether people would start shorting the airlines, thinking that Pierre wouldn't be flying quite as much next year. But, you know, I think -- I'm 62 years old, John, so, you know, we're working through this, but I've -- you know, I've always said that I'd -- as long as my health is good and the Board will put up with me, my intention would be to work till the normal retirement age, which I guess would be 65. But, you know, we -- we take that a year at a time. But in all reality, I fully intend to do that. If I suddenly leave earlier, you will know that something happened. I think when you look at the team we've put in place and I don't have the -- I don't have the 10-K in front of me, but I will do it a little bit by -- I mean Dick O'Brien is 51 -- 52; Tom Enos is 55; Britt Banks is a teenager; David Harquail, I think, is 48. 49? 48. Steve Enders is 52. And Darla would be very upset. She's not in the room and I don't want to report that I reported her age, but I think she's in the general range of -- of the other age -- the other people that were named.
John Tumazos: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question from Michael Fowler, Desjardins Securities.
Michael Fowler: Yes, I was wondering about the -- in the cash flow statement under investment activities, there's some quite nice swings, I guess is, in terms of investments in marketable debt and equity securities and proceeds from the sale of marketable debt and equities, et cetera, et cetera. I wondered if you could explain, you know, what is going on there? I understand, Pierre, that you've been selling and buying, but if you could be a bit more specific?
Russ Ball: Mike, Russ Ball. That is a peculiarity of US GAAP. What we have there is our surplus cash is invested in marketable debt securities mainly and the GAAP requirement is that if the tenure of that investment is longer than 90 days, you have to reflect both the investing and subsequent redemption of that as an inflow and an outflow in the cash flow in the investment activity section. So, when you see that big movement -- and I'm looking at the nine months in the earnings release, you will see there investments to marketable debt securities of $1.4 billion and proceeds from the sale of marketable debt and equity securities of 1.9. All that -- all that is, in effect, Mike, is thus moving cash around -- surplus cash to generate the highest investment yield.
Michael Fowler: Okay. I got that, Russ. Thanks. And the acquisitions there of, what, 348 and proceeds from the sale of assets of Newmont Capital?
Russ Ball: Exactly. The 348 is the year-to-date number and that's our interest in Boddington and as Pierre mentioned, the FALC JV and then there's a little bit else in there. We described you a couple of placements, but nothing of any significance other than those two.
Michael Fowler: Okay. Thanks. Second question here is probably more in terms of the costs going forward, with some of these projects coming onstream, do you think, Wayne that you could actually contain those -- I mean your costs have been going up quite dramatically, with new sources of production. Do you think you can actually keep the costs around where they are right now with the addition of Boddington, Akyem and all of the other developments.
Wayne Murdy: Well, you know, of course, that's something we're working very hard to do. Over the longer term, obviously, bringing in newer mines that are replacing the older, depleted mines helps. But the reality is we've been going through a period, while our costs have gone up, the whole industry cost curve has changed and we're roughly in line, maybe even slightly down a little better. The big issue that affects us is we had the very low costs at Yanacocha. And as that mine has matured and the change in mix, it's a smaller piece of the total pie. So, that's something that's a little unique to our circumstance. But, you know, we're working through our business plan for next year and when we're ready to put out the guidance, we will, but it's -- I can tell you it's something that the management team is spending an incredible amount of time at. It's an item that is of active discussion, as you could imagine with our Board of Directors. But the world has changed and, you know, with where energy costs are and all the other consumables and the shortages of labor globally in the trades, it's -- it's a very different world today. So, we expect to continue to be very competitive, vis-à-vis the industry and bringing on new generations of mines is part of that strategy.
Michael Fowler: Well, I guess just to the general comment -- is -- is all these projects that are coming on stream, would they have cash costs which are less than what you have, say, reported today?
Wayne Murdy: You know, it's -- we have said that all of them would have cash costs that should be more competitive to the industry average, but I think you got to look to what's happening in the costs that we can't control and that's primarily the commodities. So, we expect to be very competitive vis-à-vis the industry. I think you will have to take a view on where you think those costs will be because there is just too many inputs in that. But when we look at the mines we're building, Boddington, very long life. We think there's tremendous upside potential as we start to get into a next wave of drilling there. Leeville has been, tough to start up, but we've always said once we get down there, we expect to find a lot more ounces and we expect to see some better grades and we've had indications that would say that that's -- our expectations will be met there. So, you know, we're in a business that has taken a step change in its cost structure and I think if you just look at the -- at the report this year, that all feels you can see that across the whole industry. So, if it sounds like I'm dancing a little bit, it's because I am tapping my shoes here because, you know, until we really do see energy costs flatten out, we really do see the labor situation improve in the trade globally, it's -- it's hard to say where the costs are going to be but that being said, we've been able to see expanding margins and we expect to see that continue on as we go forward.
Michael Fowler: Okay, very good, Wayne. Just a very quick one for Pierre. I think when you said there were downside on the gold price was -- I think you said $20 or $30, but it was kind of muffled at that time. Is that what you were saying?
Pierre Lassonde: That's correct, Michael.
Wayne Murdy: And let me add something on -- you know, you made a statement that our costs had gone up dramatically. That is so, but Gold Fields Mineral Services just came out recently with their half-year costs for the industry average and that number is $306. And let me point out that that number is 75% higher than the industry average five years ago. So, what you're seeing is an industry wide phenomena. When you look at AngloGold, they reported yesterday, their numbers were 311. And I think when you look at the other competitors that have more than one mine, the average for this year is very likely to be between $305 and $310 an ounce. That's where the industry is going. So, we're still very competitive, but less so than we were two or three years ago, when we had the advantage of a strong dollar vis-à-vis other currencies. Now, you know, the dollar is sliding back and it's hurting us, but the industry is converging and we're all doing -- I'm sure that our competitors are doing the same thing we're doing, working very hard to keep those costs in check and I think that it is a step function, every sort of like 5, 10, 20 years, you see a step up and then they stay there for 10 years or so and I think we are going to get there within the next 12 to 18 months.
Michael Fowler: Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we have a question from Mr. Don Maclean of Paradigm Capital.
Don Maclean: Good afternoon, guys. This one, I guess, is for Pierre and Dave Harquail. Congratulations and good luck to both of you for your changes just announced. Newmont Capital certainly has had an outstanding performance. I wonder if you could characterize a couple of other acorns that you planted a while ago, the Miramar and the Gabriel. Both of those investments have probably tripled in value, it looks like, since you invested. But, yet, they would represent maybe 20% of current production levels if you ended up owning both of them. Could you just characterize the strategic nature of those investments?
Pierre Lassonde: Well, they are exactly what you called them. Strategic investments. And, you know, the role of Newmont Capital from day one was to basically find acorns and plant them and water them and help the management to grow them and if we do not -- if it -- the acorn doesn't fit our profile, we sell them. That's what we did with Black Gold. Or, you know, we harvested that investment. And the other ones, they've grown, they've done very well. They've done everything we had expected them to do so far and you will just have to wait and see what we do with them. But we're very pleased and we continue to -- we're not going to talk too much about our future investment because what we're finding is that too many people are following what we're doing and so you may see some numbers going in the statement and not see an explanation for them. We're going to keep our acorn a little in the shade for the time being. But we are going to continue to do so.
Don Maclean: Thanks. The sign of a good portfolio manager. People following you.
Pierre Lassonde: Well, we're very pleased. It's done extremely well. We're very high on the Shore JV. We think that it is something very unique. It's in Saskatchewan. It's in Canada. A great place. And we're very high on this one. But I got to say that Alan Hill has done an exceptional job with Gabriel. We're, you know, tickled pink by what he's done. He's done a great job. And Miramar, the same thing. So, we're very pleased with the entire profile. And of course, the Canadian oil sands, I can't enough about it. We have over $0.5 billion capital gains unrealized, of course, but it's very nice to see that.
Don Maclean: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question from Mr. Oscar Cabrera of Goldman Sachs.
Oscar Cabrera: Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations to all people making moves sideways or upwards. Just related to the costs in Ahafo, your press release indicate that you are expecting higher costs in 2007. Just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of the size of the increase now that this year the expectation is between $216 and $219 an ounce. I was just trying to -- I think for modeling purposes trying to assess what the impact of higher diesel or power costs will be next year. That's one. Then I will have another one with respect to Yanacocha.
Richard O'Brien: Oscar, it's Dick O'Brien. With respect to the first one on Ahafo, we're not prepared to give any further guidance than what we did today, which is just to indicate that future power costs is still a situation we don't fully understand with the impacts of the costs and the cost of our replacement power and it's still a mine in start-up. So, we still have other things that are influx and when we come with our production and cost estimates for 2007, we will be very clear about what you should put in your model. Certainly understand why you'd want that today, but we're not in a position to do that today.
Oscar Cabrera: Okay. And then I wondered if you could comment -- with Buenaventura in their conference call yesterday said that they expect Yanacocha to produce 1.6 million ounces of gold at approximately $300 to $320 an ounce. Would you be able to corroborate those figures and comment on as in Ahafo?
Wayne Murdy: With respect to the cost and production for Yanacocha, we have indicated in our 10-Qs previously that we think production on a consolidated basis is about 1.6 million ounces a year. So, we can corroborate the first one with respect to costs for 2007. We've indicated in that same 10-K disclosure where we think the general direction is on costs on average over the next four or five years. Again, I don't have a number that I'm comfortable giving you for guidance for 2007 CAS at this point.
Oscar Cabrera: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.
John Gaensbauer: Okay. Thanks, everybody. I think that's it. If you have any questions, we're here, give us a call.
Operator: Today's conference is concluded. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2006 Q2  (2006-07-28 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Newmont Mining Corporation second quarter 2006 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Randy Engel. Sir, you may begin when you're ready.
Randy Engel: Thank you, Operator and good afternoon to everybody and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Please note that our call will be simulcast today on our website at www.newmont.com and it will be available for a limited time for playback. On our call today we have Wayne Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Pierre Lassonde, our President; Richard O'Brien, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Tom Enos, Senior Vice President of Operations. Today Wayne will provide an overview of our second quarter highlights; and then Richard will cover our financial results; followed by Tom who will provide a review of our performance at each of our operating regions and give an update on our projects. Pierre Lassonde will cover Merchant Banking and Exploration and give us his brief thoughts on the gold market. Also I'd like to caution everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks that are unique to our industry and those risks are described in our filings with the SEC. With that now I'd like to turn it over to Wayne Murdy, our Chief Executive Officer.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you, Randy and good afternoon. During the second quarter and for the first half of the year, we delivered substantial growth in earnings, cash flow, and gold price leverage for our shareholders. For the second quarter, our net income grew to $161 million or $0.36 per share compared to $88 million or $0.20 per share for the second quarter last year, an increase of over 80%. For the year to date, net income is $374 million versus $173 million for the same period last year. For these same periods, the gold price increased approximately 40%, highlighting our leverage to the gold price. Before I turn it over to Dick to cover our financial results in a little more detail, I'd also like to note the successful start-up and first gold pour at our Ahafo project in Ghana and congratulate our team there. This represents the first production from our newest core operating region; a region that we have great, great expectations for. Ultimately, we would expect to produce in excess of a million equity ounces annually from what we can see. That number will probably grow. We also are pleased to announce the commencement of production at our Phoenix project in Nevada. Both the Ahafo and Phoenix projects are expected to achieve commercial production during the third quarter. Tom will provide more detail on these projects shortly. But first let me turn it over to Dick for more details on our financial results.
Dick O’Brien: Thanks, Wayne. As Wayne noted we generated strong earnings growth with income from continuing operations growing by over 80% to $161 million or  $0.36 per share compared with $88 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion. Consolidated gold sales were 1.9 million ounces at an average realized price of $605 per ounce. Costs applicable to sales were higher for the quarter at $298 per ounce on higher labor, energy, and consumable costs, planned maintenance downtime in Nevada, and lower production in Australia and Nevada. We generated strong operating cash flow for the quarter of $344 million compared with $135 million in the second quarter of 2005, despite $160 million increase in working capital and the non-cash physical delivery of $48 million in gold to repay debt. As you can see from this next slide, income from continuing operations for the quarter was impacted by four items that had the effect of reducing income from continuing operations by $39 million or $0.08 per share. Before I turn it over to Tom for an operations review, I want to highlight three financings that we recently completed. In June we entered into $125 million project financing for the Ahafo project in Ghana with the International Finance Corporation. The Company anticipates drawing down on this financing in the second half of 2006. In May, Yanacocha entered into a seven-year unsecured $100 million bank financing with a syndicate of Peruvian commercial banks. Just yesterday, Yanacocha issued 100 million of public bonds in the Peruvian market. These two financings should broaden the Company's stakeholder base in Peru, and through the bond offering allow Peruvian pension funds to benefit from the Company's ongoing success at Yanacocha. With that, let me turn it over to Tom for an operations review.
Tom Enos: Thank you, Dick. Starting with Nevada, where we produced 543,000 consolidated ounces at cost applicable to sales of $450 per ounce. Second quarter gold sales were down by 10% from the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of 16% decrease in mill ore grade. Costs applicable to sales increased 43% from the prior year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of lower production, higher labor, energy, and consumable costs. Costs were also impacted this quarter by planned maintenance downtime at our mill 6 processing facility. We expect costs to be lower for the remainder of the year in Nevada as production increases and grades improve. For the year we expect Nevada to produce between 2.36 million and 2.44 million equity ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $380 and $395 per ounce. Moving to Peru. Yanacocha sold 785,000 consolidated ounces in the quarter at costs applicable to sales of $185 per ounce. Gold sales increased 9% from the year-ago quarter as a 30% increase in ore grade and timing of flows from the leach pad more than offset a 16% decrease in tons of ore placed. Costs applicable to sales for the second quarter increased 19% per ounce as a result of increased consumption of commodities, as well as higher labor and royalty costs. Second half gold production is expected to decline at Yanacocha as the mine transitions to lower grade ores and higher stripping rates. For the year we expect Yanacocha to produce between 1.33 million and 1.37 million equity ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $190 and $205 per ounce. In Australia and New Zealand we sold 315,000 consolidated ounces at costs applicable to sales of $388 per ounce. Consolidated gold sales decreased 19% in the second quarter. Primarily as a result of lower grades at Kalgoorlie, Pajingo, and Martha. Combined with lower throughput at Tanami, Kalgoorlie, and Pajingo. Costs applicable to sales increased 17%, primarily due to the lower production. Second half production in Australia is expected to increase on higher grades and improved throughput. For the year, we expect Australia, New Zealand to produce between 1.39 million and 1.45 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of between $375 and $395 per ounce. At Batu Hijau in Indonesia we had consolidated sales of 117 million pounds of copper and 134,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of $0.71 per pound of copper and $196 per ounce of gold. Second quarter copper sales decreased 24% from the year-ago quarter primarily due to a 30% decrease in ore grade. Consolidated gold sales decreased by 23%, also resulting from a 33% decrease in ore grade. Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper increased 58% due to the decreased production and lower ore grade. Although copper and gold production declined during the quarter, total tons mined increased due to the mine rescheduling that was done in the first quarter. Delivery of new additional loading and haulage equipment is slightly ahead of schedule. Copper and gold production are expected to improve in the second half of the year. For the year we expect Batu Hijau to produce between 210,000 and 240,000 equity ounces of gold and 225 million to 235 million pounds of copper at costs applicable to sales of between $200 and $225 per ounce of gold and $0.65 to $0.70 per pound of copper. On our project development side, at Leeville, the underground project there in Nevada, we are on schedule for completion of the first underground materials handling system that will enable us to begin hoisting 2,100 tons per day of ore through the recently completed production shaft. By the end of 2007, the other material handling system will be in place and underground mine development at a point where we will achieve 3,200 tons of ore hoisted per day through the production shaft. At steady state production, Leeville is expected to produce between 400,000 and 450,000 ounces of gold per year. Also in Nevada our Phoenix project continues to ramp up to design production rates of 35,000 tons per day through the grinding circuit. We are continuing to optimize the plant for recovery and debottlenecking the floatation and concentration circuits there. The Phoenix project is expected to produce between 300,000 and 350,000 ounces of gold per year. Also in Nevada construction of our 200 megawatt power plant is on schedule for completion in 2008. In Ghana, our Ahafo project began processing ore in June and poured its first gold in July. At steady state production, Ahafo is expected to sell between 500,000 and 550,000 equity ounces per year. At Akyem in Ghana we continue to await approval of our environmental impact statement, after which construction will commence. Steady state gold production is expected to be between 475,000 and 525,000 ounces per year. In Australia, construction commenced in the second quarter at the Boddington project. Initial production is expected in early 2009, with steady state equity production expected to be between 600,000 and 675,000 ounces annually. Now let me turn it over to Pierre to talk about exploration, merchant banking and the gold market.
Pierre Lassonde: Thanks, Tom and good day, everyone. On the exploration we're on target to spend our $160 million of drilling that we've talked about, of which 56% will be near mine, 23% greenfields, and the rest devoted to opportunities. In Ghana at Ahafo it continues to be one of our prime sites. We have 13 new drill targets lined up. We are also drilling at Subika, the pit and underground and we are drilling two deposits at Susuan and Awonsu to NRM status this year. In Australia in the Tanami we are targeting a reserve and NRM addition at Cally at depth. This deposit continues to be open at depth and we are continuing having a good success over there. In Nevada where we were Monday and Tuesday, we are just about to completing the drilling for reserve conversion and overall, in the Company we are about at the same rates and we feel pretty confident at this point that things are looking good. We are on target for getting reserve conversion by year-end and it's looking good. Also in Nevada, in terms of drilling, Nortem and Mike deposits are two that are going under increased evaluation. Now, I will just turn over to Newmont Capital very briefly. Newmont Capital had a record quarter in every respect. This quarter, our royalty income and dividend reach a record of $29 million, 38%, up from a year ago. We've also revised our guidance for the year to between $90 million and $100 million for income for the royalty portfolio, which will be not only a record but reaching a target that we have fixed ourselves four years ago to get over $100 million in royalty income from that portfolio. As well, our equity portfolio grew $360 million to over $1.3 billion from the year-end 2005 value and all of that is giving us an unrealized pre-tax capital gains of over $800 million at the end of the quarter. Also a record. As well, you know that we have contracted to sell our Black Gold property in Alberta for CAD$310 million. This property is part of our portfolio, but not the equity portfolio. We have an estimated pre-tax gain of USD$270 million on this sale and it is expected to close on August 16. So all in all, a fabulous quarter for Newmont Capital. In terms of the gold market, very quickly the market is very firm and we continue to see the bull market evolving. With that, I will turn it over to Wayne for guidance and final words.
Wayne Murdy: We have revised our 2006 gold sales guidance to 5.9 million to 6.2 million equity ounces at costs applicable to sales of $290 to $310 per ounce. We are giving the wider and slightly lower range to reflect both lower production from Australia and Indonesia and the variability associated with ramping up basically three new projects, Ahafo, Leeville and Phoenix. Early indications are that Ahafo is performing very well. Full-year costs are now expected to be slightly higher than previously forecasted. As a result of lower projected production, slightly, but primarily as a result of higher energy costs, labor, and consumables. Clearly when we set our guidance at the beginning of the year we were looking at a 55 to $60 crude oil price. We're now forecasting based on a $70 crude oil price. Some of the higher labor costs relate to additional costs in Ghana to effectuate a very smooth start-up there. But also the fact that at Yanacocha with the higher earnings and the higher gold price we pay a higher worker's participation cost. That's not all bad. Full year copper sales are also expected to be slightly lower due to lower throughput and mine planned resequencing at Batu. Again we've gone into the next lay back so we're higher up in some lower grade material. That defers some of the higher grade material but that copper and gold grades are there and will be realized in future periods. Full year copper sales are expected to be 225 million to 235 million equity pounds at costs of $0.65 to $0.70 per pound. These guidance figures also include production from our Zarafshan operation in Uzbekistan. As we previously highlighted in an 8-K  -- and we'll be filing our 10-Q tonight and you should read that language. The Uzbek joint venture has been the subject of two adverse tax rulings and a series of other actions that make our future participation in the venture uncertain. While we hope to be able to resolve these disputes and are continuing to have discussions with the Uzbek authorities, we will intend to pursue all available options to preserve the value of our investment. With respect to 2007, the Company is in the early stages of its annual planning process and will provide updated guidance after we've completed that process. In closing, we believe we continue to offer compelling value to gold investors. With our production profile weighted to the second half and the historically stronger second half of the year gold price environment, we expect to continue to deliver leverage to the rising gold price, expanding margins, and growth in earnings and cash flow. Obviously as Pierre pointed out we'll have a significant one-time gain in the third quarter, but, again, we have shown on a consistent basis the ability to generate value out of our assets in the Newmont Capital portfolio. This is an asset that we had on the books I think for less than $10 million. So we felt that this was a good time to realize that value. It would require significant capital investment in order to put that project into production and that's not our business. But our business is making money. This is another indication of our ability to do that. With that, I'll conclude the formal part of our comments and we're very pleased to be able to answer any questions that you may have.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Hill, Citigroup.
John Hill: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the presentation. It looks like you have some things going in opposite directions in the second half of the year. Nevada cash costs coming down from 450, but Yanacocha to hit the numbers; it looks like it will go well above 250. It looks like the swing factor in here is going to be really hitting the timetable on Phoenix and Leeville. How confident are you that you can address the metallurgical issues at Phoenix and the ground conditions at Leeville to bring this to fruition?
Wayne Murdy: It's good to hear those questions and I think you've got it right. Again, we're starting up three projects. We were in Nevada earlier this week, took our Board of Directors through both of those projects. It's a challenging time for both but I'll tell you, I felt good about the chemistry that I saw when we were underground at Leeville. I mean finally getting the handling system in place and to be able to use the production shaft and get up to the 2,100 tons a day goal, which is where we want to be by the end of the year. We feel very good about that. We have been dealing with, as we've talked about, very difficult ground conditions there, but we've now come up with a methodology that we think works very well in dealing with those and that's something that we just started to do really this last quarter. But it's getting a lot of attention and we feel strongly about that. At Phoenix it's a big mill. It's going through the normal issues that you have as you start up a project like that, but it's wholesome. We've got some metallurgical issues to deal with there, but some opportunities that a year or two ago we didn't really think that we had with some of the oxide copper. So difficult during the start-up phase but longer term really a good story.
John Hill: Great. Thank you very much for that. Pierre, just curious. Any anecdotes or data points coming out of the refinery system that might give us some hope of a recovery in fabrication demand?
Pierre Lassonde: One point of reference that I could give you is the gold ETF in the first six months has taken up over 150 tons of gold, which is a record as well. So we know from the demand side on the investment side the gold ETF continues to be very, very strong. At the world gold council we're expanding the reach of that product into the Far East diligently trying to put it on other exchanges. So we feel very strong that that demand is going to continue. But I don't have anything specific in terms of the jewelry market to say at this point.
John Hill: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Bridges, JP Morgan.
John Bridges: Hi, Wayne, Pierre. The bond issuance in Yanacocha, what does that say about the longer term prospects for Yanacocha given the pullback in production? What's that money for? Is it the new oxide mill?
Wayne Murdy: I'm glad you mentioned that. That's a very successful offering. It was more than two times over subscribed. Again, it's part of a longer term strategy to allow broader participation in the Yanacocha asset from within Peru. This was sold within Peru and sold primarily to pension funds there. But obviously we're going through this decline, as we've said before. We've gone through the easy material. We're moving forward with our gold mill project. Our Board, the day before yesterday, just approved what we would call going into stage-gate four, which is the last part of our studies before we're ready to commence construction. So we're very optimistic about that. Again, Yanacocha is a tremendous resource. There's a tremendous future there. It's just not going to be able to continue to produce at the levels it has. But by any long-term measure, it will continue to be a world-class asset. So we're encouraged by some of the appointments that we're now seeing coming out of the Garcia Administration. A group of us were in Peru a couple weeks ago and I think that there's a fair amount of optimism right now within that country. Clearly there's challenges. But a big part of it is seeing that the people have more of a participation in the benefits of mining. Mining is very important to that country and, there's a good system in place, it just hasn't been executed on how the taxes are shared between the regions and the central government. So that is getting more attention and we're hopeful that those regional governments develop a capacity to really spend what's available to them. But I am encouraged at this point as we look forward within Peru.
John Bridges: Which of the mills is the go-ahead for, is this the oxide mill or is this the big floatation mill?
Wayne Murdy: This is the oxide mill initially.
John Bridges: Any ideas on when you're going to be ready to make a decision on the big mill?
Wayne Murdy: No. We've got a team in place doing a study of the sulfides. As many of you know, there's a tremendous resource there. And we're working hard at that, but we don't have a timetable yet that would be appropriate to share.
John Bridges: Thanks, Wayne. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Victor Flores - HSBC.
Victor Flores: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on John's question about the funding at Yanacocha. Could you give us at this time some details on what you expect of the oxide mill in terms of the total capital production, grades, et cetera?
Wayne Murdy: I'm going to ask Bruce Hansen to address that one.
Bruce Hansen: Yes, Victor. I mean what we're looking at is roughly a 5 million ton per year facility. Over the life it will produce somewhere on the order of 4 million plus ounces. Quite frankly, some of that would be produced if we would have heap leeched it, but obviously it accelerates some of that material. Typical feed-in to it is going to average about 3.5 grams to 4 grams of material and the cost is somewhere in the order of $245 million.
Victor Flores: When do you expect that that would be up and running?
Bruce Hansen: Our target is most likely the beginning of 2008.
Victor Flores: Great. Excellent. And just following up on Peru. Do you have a sense as to when you'll be able to give us some updated metrics on Minas Conga?
Bruce Hansen: On what?
Victor Flores: On Minas Conga?
Bruce Hansen: Right now in regard to Minas Conga, we're continuing to update the feasibility work. We're getting more active in terms of the permitting process and of course, the social engagement process within the Minas Conga region. We would anticipate to probably give you more information on our plans toward the end of the year. I think we want to see how things progress from a permitting standpoint and also how they progress from a regional election standpoint that will occur in November.
Victor Flores: Okay. Great. Thanks, Bruce.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Chidley - BJM.
Patrick Chidley: Firstly, going back to Yanacocha. There's no real mention of any exploration updates there. I'm wondering if you have a very large package of ground there and you got the Minas Conga project there. Any updates on those issues?
Steve Enders: Yes, Patrick. Yes, we do have a big exploration program going on at Yanacocha. It's focused on exploration for additional oxide, but in a different part of the district off to the east. As a matter of fact, the east of Conga. That's at the very early stages and it's hard to say much about it, but it's a major focus of our  oxide exploration program. The other big focus, frankly, is on sulfides. In and around Chakicocha, Karijugo, the Yanacocha complex is a big piece of it. And we have exploration programs going on on other parts of the property but frankly, they are delayed a little bit this year because of the time it takes to do permitting and get community support onboard.
Patrick Chidley: With respect to that last comment, has there been any movement on the Hercules]?
Steve Enders: No, there has not been at this point.
Patrick Chidley: No comment. Okay. And in Nevada, just going back to Nevada. In terms of the expected costs going forward in Nevada. I'd like to find out really how much of the cost increase that we have seen might be due to more of a permanent movement; i.e., is there a percentage of CAS, for example, that are fixed versus a variable cost that is due to items like fuel and import costs?
Pierre Lassonde: That's a very good question. You've seen an increase year on year and I'll just give it to you at a high level. What we do have from the increase from last year is about $30 due to the deferred stripping accounting changes which came into effect January 1, obviously Nevada, with the big pit sees more of that impact on their quarterly CAS than the others. So about $30 increase was due to that. We also have an agreement with Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture with Barrick where we buy that ore at the spot price. And obviously as the spot price goes up on the 75% portion that doesn't get reflected on our bottom line, it inflates CAS. We are in the process of restructuring that agreement and hope to have that in effect here soon. But that added $25 to the gold price if you compare this quarter with the previous quarter in '05.
Patrick Chidley: I'm sorry, that added $25 an ounce?
Pierre Lassonde: To our CAS number, correct.
Patrick Chidley: Total.
Pierre Lassonde: Yes. To the total. So we went from $315 last year to $450 for the quarter.  What we did see was about $50 to the lower production that Tom spoke to earlier, largely coming out of the underground. Again he did discuss some of the improvements that we expect to see in the second half. So to your question on how much of it was temporary, obviously with higher production, we helped that denominator up. What we did see, as Wayne alluded to was diesel and electricity costs up about $20 year on year. As Wayne also mentioned we have increased our forecast for the year to $70. Obviously, any movement up or down will impact the final numbers where we end up for the other part of the year. And the rest about 10 more than labor. So when I step back and look at it, I look at most of that 50 as opportunity, there is again 55 of accounting from prior year and if you need some more help on that we can help you through that. And then the other is diesel and electricity. We had a rate increase and again part of the justification for that power plant is the approximate $20 reduction we expect to see in CAS once that plant comes up in 2008.
Patrick Chidley: When would we see that in 2008? Isn't that sort of a late 2008 issue?
Tom Enos: Mid-2008 is when we anticipate the power plant to come on.
Pierre Lassonde: The other impact we will see in the second half of the year is the new fleet in Nevada, which will reduce maintenance costs. We did see significantly higher unscheduled maintenance for the second quarter on that mobile fleet. So again the investment in capital. We should start to see that in the second half of the year.
Patrick Chidley: All right. Okay. Fantastic. I might follow-up. There's a couple of things, Russ, if I could. I'll give you a call.
Pierre Lassonde: Sure, Patrick.
Patrick Chidley: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Smith - Dundee Securities.
Mark Smith: Yes. I have a couple of questions. The first is on Phoenix. I just want to understand how you are planning to report Phoenix go forward with the copper credit?
Russ Ball: It will be reported as a by-product. We look at Nevada as one operating segment and the copper is really de minimus. It's going to be somewhere between 15 million and 25 million pounds a year, versus the 300,000 to 350,000 ounces coming out on the gold side. So it will be reported as a by-product.
Mark Smith: Okay. That's a concentrate shipments, a  cost I can put against those copper credits?  Transportation and smelting and that.
Russ Ball: Yes. Mark, I can just give you a high level. 40% of the gold comes out in the gravity circuit, roughly 30% in CIL and 30% ends up in concentrate. That will give you a feel for the volume going up to get smeltered.
Mark Smith: Yes. I was looking for tons of concentrate, Russ.
Russ Ball: We can get you the number. I don't have it offhand, Mark.
Mark Smith: Yes, that would be great. Okay. Yes, I just need TRCs on that, Russ.
Russ Ball: Yes. We can get it to you, Mark.
Mark Smith: Okay. Just in light of the sales of the oil sands. Is Newmont going to now look at fuel hedging? Previously the oil sands were considered that aspect of Newmont.
Pierre Lassonde: No. They are two different things. The property that we sold, Black Gold, was a 100% owned property. Our hedged opportunity is with the ownership of 7% of Canadian Oil Sands Trust. We're not selling that.
Mark Smith: Okay. Thanks, Pierre. That's good. Just maybe if you can enlighten me, I've been noticing an awful lot of labor price increases with the steel companies in South America. Where do you see those trends going in Peru?
Wayne Murdy: I think within Peru, we continue to see some pressures on labor costs. The other side of that is in our case, as the costs go up there it will reduce the amount of worker's participation. So there's a little bit of an offset there. But I think generally around the world in all the basic industries you're going to continue to see tremendous cost pressures. It doesn't matter where you go, because there is not enough skilled labor to deal with the tremendous demand that's going on in virtually every basic industry. Certainly across the natural resource industries. You see the kind of costs that are being incurred in a place like Alberta or on the oil patch in the U.S. And certainly we see it in our cost structures, whether it's Nevada or really any part of the world. This boom in commodities has an impact and we're paying the price globally for the very low costs, low margins that we saw throughout the 1990s.
Mark Smith: Yes, it certainly is apparent now, isn't it. Just two final ones and they are actually quite short. Leeville underground conditions. You said you guys were getting a handle on those difficult ground conditions. Could you just enlighten me on how difficult they are and how much ground support you are looking at and needing?
Tom Enos: Yes, this is Tom. Again, there's two distinct zones in Leeville. What we call zone 1, zone 4 and zone 4 predominantly has the ground that is much more difficult to get through. We have developed a method there. Again, we were there on a tour and a comment was made to me, the ground doesn't look that bad because they don't see any steel sets. There aren't any steel sets in Leeville. We use a lot of shot [crate] and a lot of wire mesh. We are now able to advance at a rate that still needs to have some work on, but it's getting us where we need to be. One of the things that we've done at Leeville is we've brought an experienced underground mining contractor in to supplement our workforce. A lot of our workforce in Leeville is relatively new, inexperienced, if you will. When I say inexperienced, less than a couple of years of real underground mining experience. Again, we're through all that. We're seeing the productivity gains every day. Unfortunately, you measure them in millimeters rather than in feet.
Mark Smith: Yes. That's because we've all gone metric. Maybe you could just help me again a little bit more. Have you actually done any test doping in zone 4 or are you seeing any over break or is it holding together for you?
Tom Enos: Yes, we have. We are currently producing about 1,800 tons a day of ore out of Leeville. It's being hoisted through the ventilation shaft, but it is producing.
Mark Smith: Okay. But in terms of dilution, you're not seeing any more dilution than any more dilution than you anticipated?
Tom Enos: I don't think so.
Mark Smith: Then a final question for me. Russ, Boddington the same as Phoenix. Is it going to be merged in with the Australia, Indonesian/New Zealand reporting?
Russ Ball: Yes. We look at it again, the copper is not a significant component and it will most likely be by-product. This is a function of what long-term metal price assumptions you use to determine the split between copper and gold. But at this stage our calculations indicate that it will be a by-product down there. Again, it's in the order of magnitude depending on what year you're looking at. Somewhere between 8% and 12%. Some years as high as 14%.
Mark Smith: Okay. If you could do the same thing, just get the sort of feeling from the TCRCs off to me, that would be great.
Russ Ball: Sure.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Fowler - Desjardins Securities.
Michael Fowler: Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. I notice in the Batu Hijau copper realizations there are fairly low. Is this due to copper hedging?
Russ Ball: Hi, Mike, yes. We actually have had that question from a few people and what we've done in the Q that will be filed tonight so you'll have access to it tomorrow morning, is we actually break down that impact on a dollar basis but also on a per pound basis. Just for round numbers for the quarter, the gross or the spot price if you want before hedging was about $3.11. We had copper collars going against us as we've talked about of about $2.21. Those copper collars will at this stage based on the current production and delivery schedule end in February next year. So early in the first quarter. Going against those copper collars are the provisional pricing, the mark-to-market on those 90 days roughly of outstanding receivables, as those contracts are delivered and then priced basically three months after the month of delivery. So that gives you a gross after hedging of about $2.25 a pound. TCRCs for the quarter were around $0.53, which includes all the price participation pieces for a net of $1.72. So you will see some more disclosure on that and I think it will help you as you look forward and try to model out the impact once those hedges go away because it will be significant. This table should help you with that.
Michael Fowler: So anyway you've got hedges until February and, I guess the mark-to-market I believe it is about $500 million. Is that mostly due to the copper hedge?
Russ Ball: That's correct. I think it was $516 million at the end of the quarter.
Michael Fowler: Another question. I guess with all this talk about cost pressures, probably the only real way of getting cost down is to bring in new production. So my question is what would be the aggregate cash cost of all this new production coming on-stream?
Randy Engel: Steady state, Michael. Although as Wayne mentioned earlier we're revising our plans right now. The prior reference we've given is somewhere in that $250 range.
Wayne Murdy: I would look for something again, all the new projects we're bringing in at steady state will have cash costs or operating costs below the industry average. I think, again, relative to the full industry, while our costs have gone up versus the industry they have gone down over the last several years. We are at a point probably our worst year in Nevada this year. As we ramp up these new projects and even using the $70 oil, we see significant cost improvements over the next several years. Obviously highlighted by when we can get that power plant up in 2008. But it's very difficult in today's world to give those kinds of numbers out in the future. And I think you're going to hear less and less of that kind of guidance from the industry. The reality is that what we're putting in will be extremely competitive and the reality is that we're growing our margin at a significant rate. Again, this last quarter, despite the cost increases, we grew our margin by 70%. I think that's something that again we'd love to be able to just pull out spread sheets and give you quotes, but if you can tell me what the labor rates are going to be a year from now, if you can tell me what oil's going to be a year from now, we can give you a spreadsheet answer. But I think we're all having to chew a little bit here because the world is changing very dramatically. What is important is that we can provide that leverage to the gold price and we continue to do that and we're seeing that; if you look at this first half year at about double what the gold price has gone up and we think we can continue to do that. Then augment it in those out years by growing production and good results from our other businesses.
Michael Fowler: Thanks, Wayne, for that. Just, lastly, on the dividend, do you consider increasing the dividend since your margins are increasing quite rapidly?
Wayne Murdy: We continue to look at that at every Board meeting and we have in the past and we probably will in the future. But it obviously depends on our capital opportunities also. We want to get the best return back to our shareholders and that's clearly part of the plan.
Michael Fowler: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Barry Cooper - CIBC.
Barry Cooper: Yes, good day, gentlemen. Just wondering with Ahafo finished now what, or essentially finished, what are close to final costs for building Ahafo?
Bruce Hansen: I mean the close to final costs for building Ahafo are roughly approximately $450 million.
Barry Cooper: Correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce, was that like about $50 million over budget then?
Bruce Hansen: Well, we did change some scope there, Barry. We decided as part of that $450 million we paid for, essentially financed the construction of the power lines into Ahafo. One of which we have completed, the other that was still coming in, although we have adequate power to run the plant.
Barry Cooper: Okay. Any thoughts, then, on how Akyem's going to fall into shape? You're happy with the number that you have for it?
Bruce Hansen: Well, we're going to be going through and reestimating, reforecasting Akyem. Quite frankly, because obviously the permitting situation has taken longer than we would like. Since then, obviously the world marches on in terms of the requirements or the commodity costs and inputs into the project. Re-examining the scope of what's required from a crop compensation, land acquisition, social standpoint as well. So we're looking at all of that and then we'll get back to you once we receive those permits and we'll start commencing construction.
Wayne Murdy: I think, Barry, when you put it in context, though, the big picture, both of these projects are very efficient uses of capital. I think when we originally gave our estimates on those, my memory is it was 425, but I could be wrong. And at that point in time we're saying 450,000 ounces a year. On Akyem we're talking about slightly higher costs and again kind of in that same range. What we see now is, yes, we've had some increases in capital, but really fairly modest in relation but we've also increased those annual production numbers. So now when you add those two, if you look at those ranges on steady state you almost get to 1 million ounces whereas we were closer to 900,000 a couple years ago. Ahafo, again we continue to have tremendous discoveries there. So the real issue at Ahafo is when do we expand that and how quickly can we? And that's going to take our production up well over 1 million ounces, probably by 2010. So we're looking at, Bruce's team has a steady ongoing right now. Does it make sense to build Akyem or can we get a faster return if we use that mill we have on order and expand at Ahafo? That's a nice trade-off to have to test.
Barry Cooper: Right. Is there a critical path for -- well, there obviously is. But is there a point where the permitting, if you don't get your permits beyond a certain period there than the start-up date becomes critical. When would that be?
Wayne Murdy: We're in it. Historically we talked about getting Akyem up in 2008. Now we're really talking about it's going to be 2009. That is the critical path, is the permitting.
Steve Enders: I think in terms of focusing that plant capacity to Ahafo versus Akyem, I mean I think the end of the next quarter we're really going to have to assess that.
Barry Cooper: Finally, you had some problems there in Indonesia with respect to I guess we'll call it social issues. There are now a few problems over in Uzbekistan with taxation issues and whatnot. How's Newmont looking at the world now in terms of where it wants to be?
Wayne Murdy: When the prices are high, you suddenly have those kinds of issues every place. Not just in places like Uzbekistan and Indonesia. But, no, clearly it's a challenge and that's why we look at this as a portfolio approach. Certainly you look at opportunities wherever they emerge and then you look at it. We've always said our goal is to have more than 50% of our reserves in production in the developed world, but that doesn't mean that you don't face tax pressures in the developed world, too. I hear lots of words out of Washington, D.C. when prices are high. So we're being sensitive. I think you have to look at the world as constrictive versus in the '90s when lots of parts of the world were opening up. Today you have lots of parts of the world shutting down. You have situations like you see in Venezuela and Bolivia. You have the whole attitude that we see and really what we're facing in Central Asia is a turn away from the West and back towards Mother Russia. You see nationalism across many regions. So the world is really becoming smaller today rather than expanding the way we saw it at the end of the '80s and through most of the '90s. So, again, we're very comfortable with Peru. Will there be issues there? Sure there will. But it's a mining-friendly country. Indonesia has had its share of issues but the government there clearly wants to see an increase in foreign investment and obviously Batu Hijau is one heck of an asset there. So we continue to make our judgments. We're very pleased with the development that has gone on in Ghana. Ghana is probably one of the most progressive countries in West Africa. It's one of the few countries in Africa that's has a reasonable shot at actually achieving its millennium goals. And we want to be an important part of the growth of that economy.
Barry Cooper: Okay. So I take it from that there's some Xs on the map, but they're in highlighter form so that you can still see through them. Thanks.
Wayne Murdy: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Damon Wells - Damon Wells Interests.
Damon Wells: Yes, good afternoon over there and congratulations on a good operating quarter and fantastic results from the investment side. Well done. The previous caller has expressed concern about the dividend which seems to be stuck at levels lower than we saw in 1996. Could you be a little more specific about how you set your dividend policy and how much consideration is being given to that or to stock buybacks to help the shareholders?
Wayne Murdy: Damon, let me take a shot at that but you were really breaking up badly.
Damon Wells: Sorry.
Wayne Murdy: I hope I'm not breaking up as badly as you are.
Damon Wells: No, I can hear you, Wayne.
Wayne Murdy: I think your question was about trying to be a little more specific about dividends.
Damon Wells: That's correct.
Wayne Murdy: I mean clearly, we have said historically we want to continue to increase the dividends. We want to do it in a way that we see it's sustainable. We've grown them significantly since 2002, which currently was at a low point. The real issue right now is over this last year and the next couple of years we are spending a tremendous amount of capital. So we want to get through that phase. Again, we look at this each quarter with the Board and we can see increases coming. But right now with the tremendous amount spending, well over $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion this year. Next year won't look significantly different than that. So we have to be mindful of that. But the neat thing is we have a real strong balance sheet. We've got some assets there, unrealized gains that Pierre talked about that we can from time to time harvest. I think you'll see that here in the third quarter of this year. So we'll be prudent. We'll be conservative balance sheet. But  as we get through this spending and you start to see the real power of these investments that we're putting in, I think you'll see a resumption in the dividend growth.
Damon Wells: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from John Tumazos of Prudential.
John Tumazos: Good afternoon. You've had a more than ten-year good history in Uzbekistan. I wasn't aware of the tax issues and I believe it's the same president there the whole time. Could you maybe just tell us a little more about what's happened there?
Wayne Murdy: I think, John, it's the same regime. It's the same regime since the breakup of the Soviet Union and Uzbekistan declared its independence. But what you're seeing in that part of the world, and it's not just Uzbekistan, but you are seeing a turn away from the West. I think as a number of these countries found it maybe more difficult to project themselves into kind of the demands of the Western World with respect to some of the things that we talk about, human rights and other issues. There's clearly been a turn back to Russia. I think you're probably very aware of the things that have gone on there with a more nationalistic attitude and I think we're seeing some of that in Central Asia. So the partnership has worked very well over all these years on a macro basis. We've had a reasonable return there. We only have about four or five years of life left in that original agreement. But we've never been able to do a second deal there. Again, the goals of that country I think we've seen them change even though the regime is the same one. We'll just see how we work our way through this.
John Tumazos: Thank you and good luck.
Wayne Murdy: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to turn the call back over for any closing remarks or final comments.
Randy Engel: Thank you, Operator. We would just like to invite anyone who didn't get a chance to ask questions to please feel free to give us a call on the IR group. You can reach John Gaensbauer or myself. Thank you very much for your time.
Operator: I would like to thank everyone for participating in today's teleconference call and at this time all parties may disconnect.

On today's call, we have Wayne Murdy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Lassonde, our President and Dick O'Brien, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, Wayne will review our first quarter operating highlights, and Dick will provide the details on our financial and operating results.  We'll also cover our new project pipeline.  Pierre will review merchant banking, and give us his thoughts on the gold market, and Wayne will conclude with a few remarks about our outlook for the remainder of the year, and about the market in general. Also available for questions on the call today are Bruce Hansen, our Senior Vice President of Operations, Services and Development, Tom Enos, our Senior Vice President of Operations, and Russell Ball, our Vice President and Controller.  As we will be discussing forward-looking information, you should be aware that there are risks unique to our industry which are described in detail in our filings with the SEC.  So with that, let me turn it over to Wayne to begin the call.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you, Randy.  With income from continuing operations of $213 million or $0.48 a share, and net income of $209 million, Newmont had a good first quarter.  Consolidated gold sales of 1.8 million ounces and costs applicable to sales of $275 per ounce, were right on target and an average realized price for the quarter was $555 per ounce.  These results reflect strong margin and earnings growth, as we've benefited from the higher realized gold price and are focused on cost-containment.  The gold price is currently over $600 per ounce.  We expect to see our margins continue to expand. During the first quarter, we also continued to grow our project pipeline, adding about 3.6 million ounces to reserves, through our acquisitions of additional interests in our Akyem project in Ghana, and the Boddington project in Australia.  Our balance sheet remains very strong.  Very strong, with cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and other short-term investments of $1.5 billion.  Let me now turn it over to Richard for details on our financial and operating results.
Richard O'Brien: Thanks Wayne.  Revenues for the first quarter were 1.15 billion on consolidated gold sales of 1.84 million ounces with, as Wayne said, an average realized gold price of $555 per ounce.  This compares to revenues for the prior year quarter of 945 million, on consolidated gold sales of 1.87 million ounces at an average realized gold price of $425 per ounce.  Income from continuing operations for the quarter was 213 million or $0.48 a share, compared with 85 million or $0.19 per share for the year ago quarter. Wayne said costs applicable to sales for the first quarter of 2006 were within our target of $275 per ounce, up 16% from the year ago quarter when costs applicable to sales were $237 an ounce.  The increase is due to lower volumes, higher commodity and energy costs, higher royalties and production taxes, and changes in accounting.  However, with gold prices rising more quickly in this quarter than energy prices, our gross margin realized price minus cost applicable to sales is $280 per ounce, and approximately 50% improvement over the $188 gross margin per ounce in the first quarter of last year. Looking at the next slide, we can see that two items in the first quarter had the effect of increasing income from continuing operations by $46 million or $0.11 per share.  Tax estimate revisions in Australia, reflected on this slide, relate to the company's election in the first quarter to utilize the U.S. dollar functional currency for our Australian tax purposes.  The translation of the Australian property, plant and equipment for booked tax purposes increased the deferred tax assets by $48 million in the quarter, resulting in a deferred tax benefit.  We also generated net cash from continuing operations in the quarter of 240 million, and that's after a $164 million increase in working capital. Turning now to operating results in Nevada.  First quarter gold sales declined by 9% from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of a 14% decrease in mill ore grade and a 5% decrease in mill throughput.  Mill ore grades were lower as a result of mining lower grades at our Midas and Deep Post underground mines, mill throughput was also affected by weather and 14 days of unplanned maintenance on one of the ball mills at Mill 5. Costs applicable to sales in Nevada increased 28% from the prior year quarter, as a result of the lower production and increased labor, diesel, cyanide, and underground contract service costs.  As a heads up in the second quarter we will be taking Mill 6 down for approximately 22 days for scheduled annual maintenance.  That will result in temporarily higher costs applicable to sales in the second quarter. Also, while not in Nevada, in North America, just to note as we put forth in the earnings release, we have put Holloway on care and maintenance at the end of April.  Shifting to Peru, Yanacocha's had an outstanding quarter and sold 770,000 consolidated ounces in the quarter at costs applicable to sales of $161 per ounce. Gold sales remain constant from year ago quarter, as a 25% increase in ore grade and a 19% increase in tons of ore placed on the leach pads were offset by the timing of flows from the leach pads.  Costs applicable to sales for the first quarter increased 13% per ounce as a result of higher tons mine, offset by increased consumption of commodities and higher labor costs. For the year, we expect Yanacocha to produce between 1.33 and 1.345 million ounces, at costs applicable to sales of $185 to $195 per ounce.  In Australia and New Zealand, consolidated gold sales decreased 24% in the first quarter 2006, primarily as a result of lower grades at Jundee, Kalgoorlie, and Martha, combined with lower throughput at Tanami and Pajingo, again compared to the first quarter of last year. Costs applicable to sales increased 27%, primarily as a result of lower production.  At Batu Hijau, first quarter copper sales decreased 19% from year ago quarter due to harder ore, resulting in fewer tons processed as well as an increase in concentrate inventories at the end of the quarter. Consolidated gold sales decreased 3%, as the lower mill tons processed and higher concentrate inventories were offset by a 26% increase in gold grade mill.  Costs applicable to sales per pound of copper increased 14%, due largely to decrease production.  Batu Hijau has revised its mining plan to address the geotechnical instability in the operations in its pit wall that we disclosed in our 8-K on March 23rd.  Based on the new plan, consolidated sales for 2006 are now expected to be approximately 475 million pounds of copper, at costs applicable to sales of $0.60 to $0.65 per pound, and 460,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of approximately $160 per ounce.  This is in line with our earlier disclosure in the 8-K. Turning now to project development, our Phoenix project in Nevada is ahead of schedule and ramping up to full production, and we produced our first gold from Phoenix in March.  Steady-state operations at the Phoenix project is expected to produce approximately 350,000 ounces of gold annually. The Leeville project in Nevada is now approximately 89% complete.  We expect to achieve 2,100 tons per day production by the end of this year.  At steady-state operations we expect Leeville to produce approximately 400,000 ounces of gold annually.  Also in Nevada, we are continuing construction of our 200MW power plant for the completion in 2008. In Ghana, our Ahafo project is 95% complete.  We're currently stockpiling ore for the process start-up in June, and the project is on schedule to deliver initial gold production around mid year. At our second Ghanaian project, Akyem, we are waiting approval of our Environmental Impact Statement.  We will commence construction upon approval, and at that time we will provide more detailed estimates of project, capital and timing.  We also approved development of the Boddington project in Australia.  We expect to begin construction in the second half of 2006 for initial gold production in late 2008 or early 2009. At steady-state operations, we expect Boddington to produce approximately 650,000 annual equity ounces.  Now let me turn it over to Pierre to talk about merchant banking and the gold prices.
Pierre Lassonde: Thanks, Richard and good afternoon, everyone.  We will start with the merchant banking -- the royalty portfolio did extremely well in the first quarter.  Royalty and dividend income were up at 29 million for the quarter, up 62% from a year ago quarter.  The equity portfolio itself grew by 260 million to 1.2 billion from our year-end value of 940 million.  We currently have an unrealized pretax capital gains in the portfolio of close to ¾ of the billion dollars.  Most of that, as you probably know comes from our interest in the Canadian Oil Sands Trust, and the value of that trust has more than quadrupled since we have made our initial investment, not 2 years ago. The dividend is going to ramp up rapidly going into this year, and will greatly offset future oil price increases.  In our own portfolio, our Black Gold property in Alberta, we concluded our third season of drilling last month, and we have also initiated a baseline Environmental Impact Statement that we will be completing this year.  To fully realize the value of that asset, which has grown quite a bit since we last talked to you, mostly because the infill season -- infill drilling has been very good to us.  We've engaged advisors to review the value realization alternatives for this asset, and we will keep you appraised as we have more news on that. I will turn now over to the gold market, because with prices where they are today, I know that quite a few of you wonder if this is the top.  And I'm here to tell you that it's not.  And I think that what we see here is a -- we've seen in the past three months almost an exponential increase in the gold price, and you can expect some comeback, but it's far from being the end.  In fact, what we've seen after the Easter holiday, the Indian markets has been very, very strong on the physical side -- good demand, at around the $600 level. And when we look at the world economy, it is exactly as we have said, it would be for the past 2 years.  China continues to motor along; this morning, they issued a release on metals output, refined copper output was up 26% in the first quarter of this year in China, aluminum output was up 18%; zinc output was up 15%; lead over 38%.  And all of this output is used internally in China to continue to propel this economy. Last week I was in Dubai; there are 70 towers going up in Dubai at the rate of one floor a week, and all that material -- steel, copper is all coming from China in exchange for oil.  And what you see throughout the Middle East and throughout the Far East is the continuing growth of the underlying economies and infrastructure that is devouring more and more metals.  And also, with wealth comes increased investment in gold.  And what we see in the gold market is that the gold ETF is now in total close to $9 billion, and that is from 16 months ago essentially zero.  And when we add the commodity funds that have been created in the past 1.5 to 2 years, the commodity funds 2 years ago did not even make a $10 billion mark.  By the end of that last year they were 90 billion, and it's projected by the end of this year that commodity funds will be in the 130 to $140 billion mark, of which approximately 3% is gold, another 2.6 to 3% is copper, and so on.  And these commodity funds along with the ETF are a new way for big pension funds to play the asset class of commodities and gold in particular.  That did not exist 20 years ago.  And this is what, in great part is motoring the gold price and when we look at where we are today, I think that we all know that Spring, particularly April/May is the low season -- seasonality of the gold price, with gold at $600 in the spring time, we feel very, very good that by year-end we're going to have higher prices.  And personally, I would not be surprised that over the next 18 months that we challenge the old highs of 1980. And with that, I will turn over the microphone to Wayne for closing remarks.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you, Pierre.  In closing, we recognize that gold markets expect gold equities to provide leveraged exposure to the rising gold prices.  And if you look on page 8 of the press release you see our guidance for the year 2006.  To provide gold price leverage, we must control costs.  The slide up on the website now, it shows the difference, if you will, between last year's costs applicable to sales $239, and kind of the midpoint of our -- the range that we've provided for 2006 guidance. As this slide shows, over half of our expected costs increases this year result from higher labor, energy and consumable prices, with the remainder coming from accounting changes and planned lower grades in our mine plants.  The same pressures drove the 2005 industry median costs up $274 per ounce, which was just released in the gold field study, well above our $205 actual operating cost per ounce. As we mentioned earlier on the call, we've undertaken a number of measures focused on cost control, including the development of our lower-cost project pipeline, our investments in a new mining fleet in Nevada which translates to lower maintenance costs and of course as was mentioned earlier, the construction of a new power plant -- coal-fired power plant in Nevada that we expect will generate electricity at $0.03 to $0.035 per kilowatt-hour.  The majority of electricity that we are currently purchasing in Nevada is costing us about $0.10 a kilowatt-hour.  So you can see there's tremendous savings and tremendous economics driving that project.  We don't know what the market rate for electricity will be in 2008, we expect to bring this plant on in about the middle of 2008.  But based on today's numbers that would translate to $20 to $25 per ounce reduction in our cash costs in Nevada. Gold price now trading over $600 per ounce, the market is again looking for us to deliver substantial market expansion.  This next chart -- webcast chart shows, for the first quarter of 2006, we generated $280 per ounce cash operating margin, as compared with $202 for the year 2005, a 40% increase. For the first quarter this year we realized, as we have said, an average gold price of $555 per ounce.  If you go back and look at the $264 per ounce that was realized in the first quarter of 2001, you'd see how dramatically the market has moved.  In the last five years, the gold price has grown 110%, whereas our cash operating margin per ounce has grown by 250%.  That's the leverage that we provide.  If gold prices would hold at current levels, we could expect to see cash operating margins of well over $300 per ounce for this year, based on our cost guidance. Although we recognize that our margin growth stalled starting in the fourth quarter of 2004 and through the third quarter of 2005, we now believe that we are well-positioned to deliver substantial margin expansion in 2006 and beyond.  That concludes our prepared remarks on today's call, and we would be very pleased now to open the call for questions from the investment community.
Operator: Thank you.  At this time we are ready to begin the question-and-answer segment.  Operator instructions Thank you, our first question comes from Michael Dudas with Bear Stearns.
Michael Dudas: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Wayne Murdy: Well, Michael.
Michael Dudas: My first question is regarding -- you mentioned lower ore grades this quarter; could you give us a sense -- Wayne or someone about how that might plan out in your mine plants going into 2007, and taking into effect the ramp up you are projecting at Leeville, Phoenix and in Ghana?  How much of an impact that might have on realized costs?
Wayne Murdy: Well, I think as we look forward -- and that's what makes the project pipeline so attractive to us is we're getting into projects that have much better grades than where we stand right now.  So, Phoenix coming up the second half of this year and Ghana -- Ghana we're looking at average grades approaching 5 grams a ton.
A: I think it's closer to about 2 grams in Ghana and about 1.3 grams at Phoenix but these are new facilities, brand-new mills, high-throughput facilities and that will help us from a cost perspective.
Michael Dudas: My second question is regarding your thoughts about what's happening with some of the politics in Latin America, primarily Peru and how Newmont view that relative to further investment going forward.
A: I think, Michael, we've got to see how that the election in Peru plays out.  Of course, we are in that season of the -- and that portion of the process where there's a lot of rhetoric.  I think we are seeing in a number of parts of the world where you see government asking for or populist governments asking for a bigger piece of the pie, whether it's the oil industry or copper, base metals or any of the commodities.  And I think that's something that we've tended to see over the years.  But I think that, you know, when you look at Peru, they've got a long history of strong mining legislation and while there is a lot -- there has been some Populist rhetoric, I think we need to see how that plays out.  So, we have no strong views at this time that change our investment outlook.
Michael Dudas: I have two more questions.  First, looking at capital expenditures, your budget this year and what you might plan going forward, how much can you attribute higher commodity throughput prices, contractor lead-time issues, has impacted your capital budgets, say maybe in '05, '06, and possibly in '07?  Can you give me a ballpark percentage someone?
Bruce Hansen: Mike, this is Bruce.  It's hard to estimate, because I mean you know we are starting projects at different phases as we go through time here.  You know, so we can do some research and maybe get back to you, but we don't have any clear number on that.
Russell Ball: Mike, just one thing to remember in the guidance we put out this morning, there is about 200 million of that is capital expenditure related to the power plant in Nevada that we discussed earlier, and 50 million of the increase over the previous guidance was related to our step up in interest for the additional 2 mines in Boddington, so keep that in mind.
Michael Dudas: Duly noted, Russell.  Thank you.  My final question is for Pierre.  Pierre, how much do you think in the recent gold price movement is geopolitical factors involved?
Pierre Lassonde: Mike, that's a very difficult question.  But certainly, some of it -- whether it's $20 or $40, I don't know, it's hard to say.  What we do see, though, is -- we do see more gold flowing into Iran.  Obviously, the wealthy people there are worried themselves, because we see a very good flow of physical bullion into Dubai and then out to Iran.  But how that affects the broader market, I don't know.  I still think that in the 80/20 world that the currency, and particularly, the worry about the U.S. dollar and the current account deficit plays a much, much bigger role in the gold price than Iran at this point.
Michael Dudas: Thank you gentlemen for your time.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Patrick Chidley with BJM.
Patrick Chidley: Hi gentlemen, just a couple of questions on really what's new projects you're developing that might be the next step in terms of progress at Conga and at Martabe and Elang and particularly in relation to some of the political problems there in those two countries in Indonesia and Peru.
A: In regard to Martabe, I mean we are going through a process at the current time, looking to sell that asset.  And we've got a significant degree of interest in the asset.  It's just an asset that is a bit too small and really doesn't fit our portfolio.  In regard to Elang, we are evaluating the resource there.  It is a large, low-grade copper/gold resource, about 70 kilometers away from Batu Hijau.  We're doing quite a bit of work looking at different kinds of mining and processing scenarios, but it's still early days in regard to Elang.  Conga is more advanced.  You know, we're basically in an updated feasibility study stage there.  Clearly, also looking at the political environment in Peru and continuing to work with the local communities and politicians in the area, feel comfortable about the investment over time.
Patrick Chidley: And then, are there other projects in the Newmont portfolio, maybe in the mineralized material that you think might at least kind of (multiple speakers) margins --?
Wayne Murdy: Quite frankly, we have a very interesting and exciting pipeline of early-stage projects that we are evaluating.  Again, they are relatively early-stage.  We're looking at, does it make sense to expand our production and/or look underground at Ahafo.  We are looking at oxide copper leach project in conjunction with the Phoenix development, and a number of other projects that are moving along, but they are relatively early stages.
Patrick Chidley: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from John Tumazos with Prudential.
John Tumazos: Congratulations on all the great performance.  It's amazing how much the gold price has gone up without your stock going up as much, and --
Pierre Lassonde: With that, we agree with you, John.
John Tumazos: The Contango, I guess is running over $3.0 an ounce a month now, and I actually ran numbers wondering whether a private capital firm like Kohlberg or someone like that could hedge 4 or 5 million ounces of your output and that will be of Newmont.  And I excuse me for mentioning that evil, obscene word 'hedge'.  And you know, there are people in the world who love to hedge and some of them still have public companies and could average up their hedge books from 300 to 600 if they did the LBO on Newmont.  Do you think -- do you think it's necessary to protect your publicly traded status by locking in 7, 8, $900 in the out years with Contango for a little bit of your output?
Pierre Lassonde: John, 7, $800 a year in the out years is going to look very --
John Tumazos: It could be $1,500 if you want to do 20-20 with this Contango.
Pierre Lassonde: John, Pierre.  I think $700 is going to look like some change in terms of gold price in a few years time.  I think anybody who does that today will look very foolish, just like the central banks today, who sold gold at 250 and 300 look very foolish.
John Tumazos: But doesn't it feel frustrating that gold has gone up $200 in the last nine quarters and your stock has gone up 10%?
Wayne Murdy: John, I think when you look at that, that's why -- if you want to see a close correlation, look at our margin expansion and look at the stock price performance, and you'll see a very close correlation.  And that's why we spent time talking about margin.  Clearly, in the period 2002, 3 and 4 up until the fourth quarter, we had very strong growth in our margin and very strong stock performance.  Then we went through an extended period of time, now over a year -- five quarters where the margin did not grow at as faster rate as the gold price increased, and our performance clearly lagged.  And I think our view now is, with the increasing margin I would say this is the right time to get in and take advantage of that lagged period, but I think I'm hate to say things like that.
Randy Engel: John, its Randy.  We've taken a look at that on the wider market index, the XAU and you find the same correlation there, that Wayne just mentioned, between wider share prices and the margin.  So, that's really where our messaging is obviously focused.
John Tumazos: Do you think the market is penalizing you for spending almost 200 million on exploration?
Wayne Murdy: I don't think -- I think the market penalized us because we missed our production estimates last year, more than anything else.
John Tumazos: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, our next question will come from John Hill with Citigroup.
John Hill: Great, good afternoon everyone and congratulations on all the hard work.  A little bit more project-focused question; I was just wondering if you could fill us in on some of the particulars on Phoenix.  That's a project that has been around a long time, it certainly frustrated companies with less mettle, so to speak, than your own, in different points in time.  Can you tell us a little bit about recoveries, reconciliations, and copper separation?
Bruce Hansen: Well, I mean John, it started up in March and again it's ahead of its ramp up curve from a throughput perspective.  You know, it's had a fairly decent commissioning but it has ups and downs.  And we really haven't got into enough of a history to really reconcile and do the mass balances and the metal balances to really have a good sense there.  You know, it's going to take some tweaking from a recovery throughput standpoint.  As you are aware, it's a mill that has a gravity circuit, followed by floatation and CIL, and so you have three different kinds of recovery processes there, and it's going to continue to have to be tweaked and line balanced.  Our basic plan is, you know, for it to run at about a rate of 35,000 tons per day.  Recoveries, because of those circuits are anticipated to be in the kind of 80 to 85% range, rather than your typical 90% straight CIL-type circuit.  But, we've got a hell of a good team there and a lot of good metallurgists, and we have a lot of confidence in the process and a lot of confidence in the mill and the ore body.
John Hill: Great, thanks for that Bruce.  And then just very quickly, Pierre, I was interested in your comments on fabrication demand.  We saw that come in pretty hard about 18% in Q4, and there are certainly those out there that believe that fabrication has taken a further pretty heavy dent from the escalating gold price.  You guys are obviously very close to the market from your fabricating work and your travel -- I'm sorry, your refinery work and your travels.  I'm just curious, it sounds like you have confidence in fabrication.  And I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on that in a 600 world.
Pierre Lassonde: Yes, certainly John.  In terms of fabrication, the market that is being the most impacted is the Italian market.  The manufacturers in Italy are actually short gold since about $400, and they are hurting.  And they could have some major difficulty going forward.  But the market in the Middle East and India in particular, and China, continues to roar along at anywhere from 12% to 15% growth.  And that's because their currencies are doing better, their inflation rates are higher, so from the standpoint of buying the gold today, they look at it as an investment.  And the fact that the gold price has crested over 600 makes it even more appealing than ever before.  So, those are the markets that are continuing to motoring along.  But, in part, you know, the fabrication market will shrink, I think, this year compared to the bullion market.  The bullion market is taking a bigger piece of the market, mostly because of all the new financial instruments that are being developed and used by the pension funds and by the family offices and what not.
John Hill: Great, thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Victor Flores with HSBC.
Victor Flores: Yes, thanks, good afternoon.  I was hoping you could give us a bit of color on how you see the year involving at Yanacocha.  You had a really good first quarter, but the guidance for the year is still stuck at about 2.6 million ounces, which means that either we're going to have three much lower quarters the rest of the year or perhaps some kind of ramp down.  I was hoping you could give us a bit of sense of how production will evolve this year.
Wayne Murdy: Go-ahead.
Russell Ball: Victor, Russ here.  As you saw, we did have a strong quarter at Yanacocha.  What we see is the grade declining over the year, and the strip ratio increasing.  We have added some capital in addition to the fleet.  But we will see production come down towards the second half of the year.  We won't see that spike that we had traditionally seen at Yanacocha, with new leach pad and new ounces coming out in the third -- early into the fourth quarter.  So, don't look to history as an indication of the Yanacocha for this year.  We're comfortable with the guidance we put out, which is essentially flat -- I think it was up 13,000 equity ounces, so Yanacocha will not do what you have historically seen and you shouldn't be forecasting that in your models.
Victor Flores: Great, thanks.  And second question goes to Batu Hijau.  Could you give us an update on some of the geotechnical work that you've done there, revisions to the mine plant and what implications that might have?
Thomas Enos: Sure, this is Tom Enos.  Basically, Batu Hijau is a mine that is being mined in phases.  The current phase that we're mining is Phase 4.  Late last year, we identified a geotechnical issue in the east wall, and we have rescheduled the mine and moved a shovel up, and we are now unloading the bottom of Phase 4, if you will -- we are actually mining into Phase 5, and with that it did change the mine plan and the production plan for this year.  But again, it's material that we were going to mine anyway, it's just rephasing, rescheduling the mine.
Victor Flores: Okay, great; thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from John Bridges with JP Morgan.
John Bridges: Good afternoon, everybody.  I was just trying to dig into the costs here.  Your costs have gone up.  You did give us some indication as to how much of that relates to the mining of subgrade material, and I just wonder if you could break it about 50% you spoke of into accounting changes and how much was related to, effectively, the creation of ounces from nothing, from rock that wouldn't have produced reserves in the first place.
Wayne Murdy: I think, John, if we could go back to the -- we had that chart that really broke that down, on the webcast.  And I don't know if you saw that.
John Bridges: Sorry, I've not got the webcast up.
Wayne Murdy: Okay, if you could just pull that up a minute.
John Bridges: So, what percentages is related to those subgrade ounces?  I suppose you could really think of that cost as being related to the creation of reserves from nothing.
Wayne Murdy: The lower grade and the -- accounted for about a $12 change, year-over-year.
Randy Engel: John, it's Randy.  You've got about $12 out of $49, if you take our actual three -- probably 239 costs applicable to sales per ounce from last year, up to the midpoint of our guidance for this year.
John Bridges: So it's about a quarter of the costs increase is related to (Multiple Speakers) --
Randy Engel: It's about a quarter, exactly.  You've got about $5 in accounting change, and then the rest is made up of labor, electricity and consumables, which is going to be over 60%.
John Bridges: Okay, okay.  Great.  And on Kalgoorlie, you mentioned the underground there.  Presumably at these sort of Ausi dollar gold prices, then that stuff is now economic.
Wayne Murdy: It's starting to look interesting, and it warrants study, and so you are exactly right.  Again, that's not going to happen overnight.  But it is -- in this environment, we're looking at a lot of -- a lot of the kind of resource potential that we have around the company.  And there's suddenly lots of opportunities that we've known about for a long time, but couldn't clearly justify.
John Bridges: And you can keep Charlotte chugging along for some time, presumably, at these levels.
Wayne Murdy: Yes.  I mean, we have a project in Nevada, very large project, that we've known about for 25 years -- the Midas deposit that suddenly is getting some renewed interest plus enable to go in and look at it with today's technology.  I know, we hadn't put a hole on that for probably 15 years -- going back in today and using today's assay techniques and technology.  Things like that are very attractive.  And that's the value of the land position that Newmont has.  It's always hard to put your finger on it until you get into times like this, because we know there's real value there.
John Bridges: I was also intrigued by the oxide copper idea at Phoenix.  What do you think the probability of getting something on that up is?
Bruce Hansen: Well again, John, it's early days.  But you know we're doing a lot of metallurgical test work, the whole Phoenix area, if you remember, it was an old Duvall copper district; there's a lot of oxide copper resource there, a lot of it above the sulfide resource, and you know we are taking a very hard look at it.  And we will keep you posted on it.
John Bridges: Well presumably, you've got everything there, but this SXEW plant, so you ought to go to make it happen quickly if --
Bruce Hansen: Yeah.
John Bridges: Okay, great.  Okay, thanks, guys.
Operator: Operator instructions Our next question will come from Michael Fowler with Desjardins Securities.
Michael Fowler: Yes, good afternoon.  A couple of quick questions.  Perhaps you can give us some idea of the ground conditions that you have seen at Leeville, and perhaps also could you comment on the Deep Post ground conditions?
Wayne Murdy: The ground conditions at Deep Post and Leeville are very similar.  What we have discovered over time is that there is a way to mine these deposits underground and do them very effectively, and it's by having very experienced and trained miners and that are experienced with the ground conditions that exist in those two mines.  And we are currently in the process of moving our very experienced underground miners into Leeville from the other Carlin East deposit that it is just about mined out.  So really, things are going along as anticipated.  They are not good ground conditions from, you know, an underground mining perspective.  But we do have a good, trained work force there that are now proceeding and getting it done smoothly.
Michael Fowler: Okay, thanks.  Just on another question, is there any update on the SEC review that you're -- they are having?
Russell Ball: Mike, Russ.  We disclosed, as you've probably seen in the K and you will in this Q again, we are in a comment letter process with them.  We received a third comment letter on April 5th; we are busy responding to that.  Essentially issue is expiration accounting related to the purchase price acquisition from February '02.  We do not believe that the issues are significant.  Obviously, there is a large balance on the balance sheet.  We are very comfortable with our accounting and are working through the process of explaining that to the staff at the SEC.  So again, we are trying to expedite it from our end and respond as quickly as we can.  We have been receiving assistance from our auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and also our independent valuation expert, on this one.  So we are very comfortable with our accounting and are helping the staff understand our logic and rationale behind that assigns fair value to those different segments.
Michael Fowler: Russ, just to follow-up on that, do you think that you would have to sort of reallocate some of the goodwill I guess, into property, plant and equipment, on your balance sheet?
Russell Ball: No, Mike, at this stage we're comfortable with our accounting.  Where this is going to end up we don't know.  Again, we have Waters' opinions, we have our evaluation experts that are also comfortable with our accounting, and it's really incumbent on us to work through our models and our logic and our rationale.  Because, we believe that each company is different, and some of the recent like what you've seen may not necessarily be applicable to Newmont.  Again, we are comfortable that the facts and circumstances in our particular situation are different from what the SEC staff may have seen recently, and really what we're going through, Mike, is trying to explain to them where we are and why we think our accounting is appropriate.
Michael Fowler: Okay, many thanks for that, Russ.
Operator: Thank you, our final question today comes from Chantal Gosselin with Haywood Securities.
Chantal Gosselin: Good afternoon.  A quick question regarding -- what's your philosophy on acquisitions, if you can give us some sense of it as well, what are your thoughts on the current market evaluation?
Wayne Murdy: Well, it's a question we often get.  And clearly now, Newmont has a history that when it seize an opportunity that ties in with our strategy, we're not afraid to step up and take that opportunity.  By the same token, we try to be very selective.  As we look at the market today, this industry is small enough that we can pretty much be updating our views on a continuous basis, and to the extent that they would -- we are in a period where we think that there may be some strategic fits out there.  There's always a pricing side of that equation.  So, if something is attractive that fits in with our strategy, and strategically a direction that we're going, we attempt to do that, to grow the company.  But we are very cognizant of the dilutive effect of many peoples acquisitions, and so we want to see something that has upside potential and has the ability to be accretive on a per-share basis.
Chantal Gosselin: Are you open to any stage of a mine life, like a development or exploration to already producing?
Wayne Murdy: Yes.  Now, when you are into production though, again as I said, we're looking for things that have upside.  So, you know, I think we have executed on transactions in all three of those phases.
Chantal Gosselin: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir.  That does conclude our Q&A session for today.

===== 2005 Q4  (2006-02-28 16:15:00) =====
Randy Engel: Thank you operator.  Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and year end 2005 earnings call.  Please note that this call is being presented and simulcast on our website at www.newmont.com and will be available for playback for a limited time.  On today’s call we have Wayne Murdy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Lassonde, President, Richard O’Brien, Senior. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tom Enos, Senior Vice President of Operations, and Bruce Hansen our Senior Vice President of Operations Services.  As we will be discussing forward looking information, you should be aware that there are risks unique to our industry which are described in detail with our filings with the SEC and with that, I’d like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, Wayne Murdy.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you Randy and good afternoon everyone.  I’ll review our fourth quarter and year end financial and operating highlights, then Dick will provide the details of our financial results and Tom will cover our operations.  Bruce will then give an update on our new projects and Pierre will review the merchant banking, reserves and exploration and give us his thoughts on the gold market I’m sure.  I’ll conclude with our 2006 guidance. Newmont had a strong fourth quarter and a solid year in 2005 generating industry leading operating cash flow of some $1.63 billion despite lower earnings from industry wide cross pressures and various non cash accounting items.  During the fourth quarter, we had higher margins, selling 2.4 million consolidated ounces or 1.8 million equity ounces at an average realized gold price of $472 per ounce with costs applicable to sales of $230 per ounce.  We generated fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $72 million or 16¢ a share, and generated net cash from continuing operations of almost $500 million at $489 million. Dick will cover some of the accounting items, but these have the net effect of reducing the income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter by some $84 million or 19¢ per share after tax.  For the full year 2005, we sold our target of 8.6 million in consolidated ounces that translated to 6.5 million equity ounces at an average realized gold price of $441 per ounce and costs applicable to sales of $236 per ounce.  We generated full year income from continuing operations of $374 million or 84¢ per share.  Again, accounting items had the effect of decreasing income from continuing operations by $34 million or 7¢ a share after tax.  At year end, our balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities and other investments of some $1.9 billion dollars.  Finally, we increased our reserves for the fourth straight year, finishing 2005 with 93.2 million equity ounces using a $400 gold price assumption.  Given the impact of some January transactions, January and February where we increased our interest in the Akyem project and the Boddington project on a pro forma basis our reserves at year end stood at 98.6 million ounces. Before I turn it over to Dick, I’d like to say a few words about cost pressures.  Over the past year, you’ve heard us and the rest of the industry talk quite a bit about cost escalation and its impact on margin growth.  We have seen significant increases in fuel and other input commodity costs, labor costs, primarily in our Nevada operations and Australian operations.  For 2006, our guidance indicates we expect our average cost applicable to sales to be in the range of $280 per ounce, and nearly $380 per ounce in Nevada.  However, of the roughly $47 per ounce increase expected in Nevada, about $25 is attributed to the effect of accounting changes, deferred stripping specifically which in 2005 was a credit to our cost structure but in 2006 will actually be an additional expense.  I also see the impact of expensing stock options, although that does not have near the effect of the deferred stripping change.  This is something that will add a fair amount of volatility to the cost structure in all operations for all mining companies going forward.  Of the remaining increase, approximately $10 is attributable to labor costs as we made a large out of cycle increase last year in Nevada which will impact the full year 2006 and $15 is the full year impact of increases in energy costs primarily electricity costs in Nevada. Our consolidated cost structure will also be negatively impacted this year by lower production from Yanacconcha our lowest cost operation where costs are expected to increase from last year’s $145 per ounce to an expected $185 per ounce this year.  Almost all of the cost increase at Yanaconcha is due to the lower dominator, lower production, resulting from lower grades and higher stripping.  We have several initiatives under way to address cost escalation.  During the call you’ll hear about our development projects which over the next three to four years will give us five new mines producing about 2.5 million ounces with competitive cost structures.  Three of these projects will come on in 2006.  We’ve also begun construction on our power plant in Nevada having finally received the full clearance on our permits a couple of days before Christmas.  Together we believe these initiates will help lower our average costs in Nevada and worldwide. With that, now I’ll turn it over to Dick O’Brien for a closer look at the financial results.
Richard O’Brien: Thanks.  Focusing on Slide 6 you can see revenues for the fourth quarter will be $1.3 billion at an average realized gold price of $472 per ounce.  This compares to revenues for the prior year quarter of $1.2 billion at an average realized gold price of $436 per ounce.  As Wayne mentioned, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $72 million or 16¢ per share, compared with $150 million or 34¢ per share for the year ago quarter.  For the full year 2005 income from continuing operations was $374 million or 84¢ per share, compared with $455 million or $1.02 per share for 2004.  Looking at the next Slide, you can see that income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was impacted by various items that had the effect of decreasing income from  continuing operations by $84 million or 19¢ a share.  Mention income from continuing operations for the full year 2005 was $374 million or 84¢ per share and was impacted again by a number of items that had the effect of reducing income from continuing operations by $34 million or 7¢ per share.  As Wayne noted, we also generated net cash from continuing operations of $.25 billion in 2005. Now to focus on operations, I’ll turn it over to Tom Enos.
Thomas Enos: Thanks, Dick.  For the fourth quarter 2005 consolidated gold sales from continuing operations were approximately 2.4 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $230 per ounce.  For the full year, consolidated gold sales from continuing operations were approximately 8.6 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $236 per ounce. Looking at Nevada, fourth quarter gold sales declined by 7% from the year ago quarter as an 8% increase in mill through put a 14% in keep leach hall placed were upset by a 14% decrease in mill ore grade.  Similar to the third quarter, the adverse mill grades were the continued result of unfavorable ground conditions and labor shortages at our underground operations which impacted production rates from higher grade underground ore zones.  Costs applicable to sales for the fourth quarter increased 25% from the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower volumes, increased labor and underground services costs as well as increased diesel and input commodity prices.  For the full year 2005, Nevada operations sold approximately 2.4 million ounces on a consolidated basis at costs applicable to sales of $333 per ounce.  2006 we expect Nevada’s consolidated gold sales to be approximately 2.6 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $383 per ounce.  As Wayne discussed, cost control and improving production are major focuses for our Nevada operations in 2006.  We have made significant investments in new projects and new mining equipment and we expect these investments to help reduce costs by approximately 5%-10% in 2007.  As Wayne mentioned, we have also begun construction on our Nevada power plant which will also contribute to lower costs. Shifting to Peru, Minera Yanaconcha had a record fourth quarter, selling 1.1 million ounces on a consolidated basis at costs applicable to sales of $145 per ounce.  Gold sales increased 25% from the year ago quarter as a 15% increase in ore placed on the leach pads was only partly offset by a (inaudible) increase in ore grade.  Costs applicable to sales through the fourth quarter increased 10% $145 per ounce, the result of increased labor and commodity costs.  For the full year 2005, the Yanaconcha sold 3.3 million ounces on a consolidated basis at costs applicable to sales of $147 per ounce.  In 2006, we expect consolidated sales at Yanaconcha of approximately 2.6 million ounces at costs applicable to sales of $185 per ounce.  The rise in costs is almost entirely attributable to the lower expected production resulting from lower grades. Moving on to Australia and New Zealand, consolidated gold sales decreased 16% in the fourth quarter 2005, primarily as a result of lower grades at Tanami and Kalgoorlie combined with lower through put and Tanami and Pajingo.  Cost applicable to sales increased 8% primarily due to lower production and increased commodity cost.  Consolidated sales for the year were 1.6 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $317.  In 2006 we expect to sell approximately 1.5 million ounces at cost applicable to sales of $327 per ounce. At Batu Hijau in Indonesia, copper sales decreased 22% in the fourth quarter to 129 pounds at consolidated gold sales remained constant from the year ago quarter at approximately 181,000 ounces.  Cost applicable to sales per pound of copper and once of gold increased 25% and 19% respectively as a result of increased fuel, maintenance, consumable power and labor cost.  For the full year 2005 on a consolidated basis, Batu Hijau sold 73 million pounds of copper and 720,000 ounces of gold at costs applicable to sales of 53¢ per pound and $152 per ounce respectively.  In 2006 we expect to sell 565 million pounds of copper and 575,000 ounces of gold on a consolidated basis at cost applicable to sales of 45¢ per pound and $155 per ounce respectively. Now I’ll turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Hanson: Thank you Tom.  At the Phoenix glut in Nevada, commissioning of the plant has already begun and we expect initial gold production to show up in April.  Eagle project also in Nevada is approximately 86% complete.  The production shaft has reached its final depth in November of 2005 and the mine is de-watered below the shaft bottom.  The remaining construction work primarily relates to completion of the underground facilities.  We see leave knoll ramping up to achieve approximately 2,100 tons per day of production by the end of 2006. Also in Nevada, as previously discussed, we have begun construction of our power plant which was approved by our Board of Directors in January.  Project engineering is 50% complete and we’re targeting a mid 2008 completion.  This power plant again is a significant part of our cost control initiative and will provide long term reliable energy for projects like Leeville and Phoenix.  In Ghana, we are now advancing both of our projects the Ahalo project and the Akyem project.  At Ahalo, engineering procurement camp and general infrastructure construction is essentially complete.  The process plant and related facilities are now approximately 76% complete and overall construction was 83% at the end of January.  We’ve also begun commencing mining and stockpiling of ore which started in January for initial gold production in the second half of this year.  In 2006 we expect Ahalo to contribute approximately 260,000 ounces.  Annual gold sales from Ahalo are expected to average between 500,000 and 550,000 ounces at a steady production rate.  As a result of continued exploration success, we are also already undertaking early studies of expansion opportunities at Ahalo looking at process capacity additions and potential underground development The Akyem project was approved in 2000, in July of 2005.  We are awaiting approval of our environmental impact statement and we are targeting initial production in the second half of 2008.  We also expect Akyem to produce approximately 500,000 to 550,000 ounces a year on a steady  state basis.  Finally, as we announced this morning, Newmont’s Board of Directors has approved the development of the Boddington project in Western Australia.  In February, Nemont entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 22.22% interest in Boddington from Newcrest Ltd. taking Newmont’s interest in the project to 2/3.  The other 1/3 is owned by AngloGold Ashanti.  The Boddington project has total gold reserves of over 11 million ounces and a current estimated life in excess of 15 years.  Newmont’s share of initial capital will range between $900 million and $1 billion and we expect our share of annual production to be approximately 700,000 ounces for the first five years production and approximately 600,000 ounces per year for the life of the project.  We are currently targeting completion and initial production toward the end of 2008.  We feel that Boddington as substantial exploration opportunity and extensive non metallization material which indicates the potential to potentially ultimately double our reserves at Boddington.  Now with that, let me turn it over to Pierre to talk about reserves at exploration and Newmont Capital.
Pierre Lassonde: Thanks Bruce.  And welcome everyone.  As Wayne mentioned earlier, the achievement of our exploration team this year has been to replace reserves and grow reserves for the fourth straight year.  Using $400 for price assumption, we grew reserves from 92.4 million to 93.2 million at year end and mostly from Ghana which continues to out perform and while we grew reserve by 17% to 18.7 million equity ounces.  In Nevada we’ve also had a great year, Phoenix in particular added 600,000 ounces to now almost 9 million ounces of reserve and in Peru Menos Conga grew reserve by 36% to 6.1 million equity ounces and also notably Australia this year we placed reserve at 1.5 million ounces very notable achievement. And also as Wayne pointed out subsequent to year end we acquired the remaining 15% of the Akyem project in Ghana and as well as signed a letter of agreement to acquire the 22% of Newcrest, increasing our total reserve to something like 98 million ounces.  If you look at the reserve sensitivity, at $425 gold, our reserve would increase approximately 5 million ounces to actually 6 million to almost 99 million ounces and our $450 gold by about 11% in line with the gold prices really at 103.7 million ounces.  A decrease of $25 would decrease our total reserve by about 8% to 86 million ounces.  The further impact of higher gold price is constrained by limited drill veta n the margins of known metallization.  What we’re really saying is that we have not drilled our pits at $450 or $500 gold as we just haven’t had the time or the money to do so.  We are working on it.  It will take a long time for that to get there.  As we look at the fourth quarter and the full year 2005, our fourth quarter expenditures were $43 million and for the full year $147 million.  For 2006, the guidance will be about spent at about $155 to $165 million in exploration and an additional $40 to $45 million for advanced projects research and development.  And when we look at the dollars spent, 56% is mere mine ground fuel, and 46% is Greenfield.  You can see that we are putting a lot more emphasis on Greenfield exploration to increase our non reserve metallization pipeline so that we can continue to grow our reserves in the future.  For 2006 our outlook is the continued district expansion at Ahalo, since we started to work Ghana four years ago we’ve new discoveries and trend we hope will conti9nue this year.  In New Zealand the ground expansion in Martha will go on the same as underground program at Kalgorlie and Jundee in Australia.  And finally, we will do a fair amount of work on advance gold, copper target at Pajingo, Midas in Nevada, (inaudible) in Indonesia and Boddingtons in Australia.  These are all very large scale gold, copper targets that could add significant metallization and down the road reserves to Newmont if we can bring in Minahasa. I’d like to turn your attention to Newmont Capital which had a fabulous year in 2005.  The royalty portfolio net income was up 24% to $23 million in the third quarter and it was up 20% to $79 million for 2005 versus 2004.  The equity portfolio, the year end market value of the equity portfolio was $940 million, an increase of $433 million from year end 2004.  If you look at our return on average invested capital for the year, it’s 80%.  We’re quite proud of that.  The unrealized capital gains exceed over $500 million at year end.  In terms of our asset portfolio, and we’re talking here about our black gold property, the Alberta Oil Sand, we have started environmental base line studies and unshell drilling, we’ve done a pre-feasibility study which indicates that there’s a 165 million economically recoverable barrels of oil with potential production of 25,000 barrels per day via a phase development.  We just completed the intro program for this winter.  We got a look at the results and continue to develop this asset. Finally, in terms of the gold market I’ll be very brief, I think that usually between February and May we see on a seasonal basis, the decline in gold price.  We haven’t seen it this year and I think that is a very significant factor.  It’s the need to grow BTF and the market has now taken over 430 tons of gold in 14-15 months.  It has a significant impact on the gold market and whether or not we will see the seasonality this year, I believe remains a question.  For the time being, we’re looking at a gold price for the next six to nine months of $525 to $600 in that bracket and you know, baring any unforeseen major blowup in the world.  And with that, I will turn it over to Wayne for his concluding remarks.
Wayne Murdy: Thank you Pierre.  Again, for 2006 we expect consolidated gold sales of about 8 million ounces of cost applicable to sales of approximately $280 per ounce.  We also expect to generate consolidated copper sales of about 565 million pounds at costs of about 45¢ per pound.  The guidance breakdown shown on this slide is also provided for your reference.  In 2005 we saw a good year but a year that clearly had challenge.  Earnings were affected by various non cash charges and asset write-downs.  And of course we were not immune to the rising costs facing the industry.  However, we generated industry rating operating cash flow for the year and saw margins improve in the fourth quarter.  Our leverage to gold prices increased over the last six months of 2005 and we also increased our reserves for the fourth straight year.  Looking forward, we see several positive developments that we believe will deliver increased leverage to gold price and value to our shareholders.  We will be brining on three new projects this year in Nevada and Ghana and have two more significant projects, Boddington and Akyem in development for completion in 2008.  We also remain steadfast in our commitment to cost control and our opposition to hedging.  We believe we are in a long term bull market and that these projects are the cornerstone of Newmont’s growth story over the next several years. Thank you very much for your time and with that; let me turn the call over to the operator so that we can take your questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from John Hill of Citigroup
John Hill: Good afternoon everyone.  Hello.  I was just wondering if you could share a few additional thoughts on Boddington in terms of the flow sheet and some of the equipment selection.  There have been a number of variables in air on that one over the years.
Wayne Murdy: Okay John, I’m going to ask Bruce to talk about Boddington.  We’re very excited about that.
Bruce Hansen: We are extremely about Boddington, John.  And you know, we’re looking at roughly a through pit rate at Boddington at approximately 35 to 38 million tons.  The flow sheet will have primary and secondary pressures followed by a series of high pressure grinding rolls, feeding into ball mill, set of ball mills going into flotation followed by CIL.  So it will be a big it will be a very robust plant, we’re very confident in terms of capacity of that plant and our ability to deliver it.  On the mining side, we’ll have, we’ll be using large loke shovels, electric shovels, and we’ll be loading roughly 230 metric ton trucks, fairly significant fleet and you know fairly conventional in terms of its nature.  So, a big project, but not overly complex.
John Hill: Okay, great.  Thanks for that.  And then very briefly, on the reserve side, there are some interesting asymmetries I guess.  We took the gold price modeling assumption up from $375 to $400 that was worth 2.6 million ounces but in your sensitivities table if we carve 25 bucks on an ounce off today, we go down by 6.9 and I assume that’s lower grades in Nevada but I was just wondering if you could shed some light on that unusual asymmetry there?
Wayne Murdy: I think what you’re talking about there John, is the fact that you know in the actual results for 2005, that also had the net impact of increases in costs.  When we look at sensitivities on a go forward basis, we’re essentially freezing costs and we’re adjusting the gold price only.
John Hill: Very good.  Thank you.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from John Bridges of JP Morgan.
John Bridges: Hi, John Bridges.  I was just wondering with respect to the way the gold prices are moving up, I seem to remember on a visit a year or two ago, there was a lot of low grade material at Kalgoorlie, you know on the face of it, the lower grade there is a negative, but I seem to remember there was a big potential increase to the reserves.  What’s the prognosis there?
Leroy Shoots: John, this is Leroy Shoots.  At Kalgoorlie there’s a sizeable NRM that fell out of our numbers earlier on because of the pit angle not being able to take it in.  We’ve seen, however, that this material has potential with the higher gold price environment to go underground but we’re investigating the engineering capabilities and the other process capabilities as well.  So the upside is largely in that setting.
John Bridges: So you’re working on that one?
Leroy Shoots: Yes we are.  We’ve got a plan this year to do some additional drilling in that setting.
John Bridges: I wonder also with respect to the Greenfields portion of your exploration project, could you point out or maybe rank the targets that you’re looking at?
Pierre Lassonde: John, it’s Pierre.  In terms of the Greenfield, you were sticking basically 80% to the countries where we already operate so you look at our budget and that is quite significant.  Our budget in Peru also is quite significant.  And in Nevada and Australia the other two places and I would say that approximately 80% of our budget would be in those four countries.  And then the other 20% of it you know in other places where we see opportunities.
John Bridges: Okay. Great.  And for the technically inclined, is there you know a summary of the Boddington feasibility study we could get our hands on?
Wayne Murdy: John, I mean we put out a press release today and you know as things evolve we’ll be providing you with additional information.  I don’t know if we have in essence a summary of the feasibility study that we are distributing.
Brian Hansen: John, we don’t have anything of that nature at this point.  We have the release out there at this point.
John Bridges: Okay.  Thanks guys.
Pierre Lassonde: Also John, just to reemphasize, we talked about asymmetry you know the fact is that today gold price is $550 our reserves are calculated at $150 (inaudible).then today’s gold price, but also the fact is that we just haven’t drilled our pit at $500 gold but are let alone $550.  And you know the effort to do so and the money is significant and it will take us literally at least a couple of years to get there.  So, there should be a little bit more to come and in terms of you know higher gold prices, but we’re also very mindful of profitless prosperity when you add the reserve ounces that will cost you $500, you know, your margin is only $50, we’d rather spend the money on ounces that will cost you $250 where you have a $200 or $300 margin.  That’s the choice that we have to make otherwise we’d end up with the you know $500 million exploration budget.
John Bridges: That was the other John’s question I think but I think we understand that.  I was just trying to get a sense as to where the you know the new reserve additions are going to come from.
Bruce Hansen: Okay.
Operator: Thank you.  And again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.  And star 2 to cancel. And our next question comes from Mike Dudas, Bear Stearns.
Mike Dudas: Good afternoon gentlemen.  Can someone go over the copper realizations for 2006, how long the hedges may run through and when we might see more market based realizations for Batu Hijau?
Wayne Murdy: I’ll ask Russell to do that.
Russell Ball: Hey Mike, we’ll be filing a 10K on Wednesday and you will have plenty of detail and suffice to say these hedges are done in the first quarter of next year.  There’s very little that rolls over into next year and the last schedule I looked at had about 60% for ’06 hedged.  But we’ll check and finalize and if it’s anything different, I’ll let Randy know and he can get back to you.  But it’s about 60% at $1.35.
Mike Dudas: For 2000 – I’m sorry for 2006?
Russell Ball: 2006.  There’s minimal that rolls over into 2007.
Mike Dudas: Terrific, thank you.  And question for Pierre, where do you see the Newmont Capital opportunities going for the next couple of years, given what you have on the plate and some of the things that may not be as visible to the rest of the market?
Pierre Lassonde: Well if we told you, you couldn’t trade it.  Mike, you know the, where we’ve done of course exceeding well is our position with Canadian Oil Frame, it does represent probably over 80% of our capital gain and we continue to hold that position.  We continue to believe the stock is going to go higher and once the dividend reaches approximately $10, $11 a share which we think it’s going to be in the next 18 months, it’s the equivalent of $10 an ounce on the price of gold on energy at you know $55, $60 oil.  Anything higher in oil price will have higher dividends, so that means a great deal to us.  In terms of our position you know we have made a number of you know fairly public in terms of the Gabriel and the Shore and others and we continue, the great thing about this statement is that you know there are discoveries all the time and we continue to look for opportunities.  We have 300 and almost 50 geologists that our eyes and ears on the ground and they feed us opportunities and we continue to believe that there will be new discoveries made by juniors over the next 2-3 years and we want to participate in at least one or two of these five new (inaudible) discoveries.  We will be there.  We are absolutely totally confident that it will come.
Mike Dudas: Terrific.  One final question for Tom.  Could you elaborate a little more on the labor issues, especially on the underground side in Nevada and do you think that could limit some development that you or other companies might have over the next three to five year as some of these horse transition lower given some of the lack of availability not only in Hard Rock but other types of mining from a skill set base?
Thomas Enos: Well I think we’ve got our arms around it.  We put in place a training program.  We’re also in the process of building a sub-division in Elko to – it’s been an issue for employees, the underground employees.  Just no place to live, so I think we’re in front of that one.
Mike Dudas: Terrific.  Thanks gentlemen.
Operator: Thank you.  And our next question comes from John Tumasis, Prudential.
John Tumasis: Good afternoon.  Could you elaborate a little bit on the $300 I believe I heard $380 cost up with the sales force for Nevada this year?  Hopefully the leevill ounces will be much lower cost than that.  Gas prices have fallen.  Last year I thought was an easy comparison at $333 and just give us a little rundown of what’s getting better and what’s getting worse
Wayne Murdy: Hey John.  I think maybe let me just cover a couple of things.  First of all, part of the increase is in fact accounting changes.  It’s the expensing of deferred stripping and in that $333 if you go back to the detail in the press release you’ll see that there was actually a $23 credit for deferred stripping.  Next year that will be a expense of $5.  So that’s obviously a sizable swing for us.  While the gas price drop off is well appreciated, the big factor for us is what’s happened to electric costs out there.  But the big item for us, was freight (inaudible) for that kilowatt hour for the majority of our electricity out there and that’s been a big factor and then the third item is on the labor cost we did do an out of cycle 8% across the board increase to our union and non-union people last August.  And the impact of that on the full year is about $10.  Leeville is coming on slower than we anticipated (inaudible) bring that up to 2,100 tons a day by the end of the year, but it will be well into next year when we get to the full capacity there of about 3,200 tons a day.  And that is primarily the result of ground conditions there which have been much more difficult.  We’ve run into more water and tougher ground conditions than was anticipated on the surface.  So, while we are going through the toughest part of that this year, we look out in 2007, we can see costs coming back up to 10%.  I think we have some other moves in place as you are aware we haven’t invested a lot of capital, (inaudible) it has cost with us, we’re putting in a new mining fleet in a large part of Nevada last year and this year and so we’ll see improve maintenance costs so while this is a difficult year to look at, we think we can see the other side (inaudible) much better cost structure.
John Tumasis: Thank you for your explanation.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Dave Gagilano, Credit Suisse.
Dave Gagilano: Hi, thanks.  In you remarks you commented briefly on the 2007 allocs for Nevada, I was just wondering if you could shed some light on the 2007 operating outlook for Yanaconcha as well?
Wayne Murdy: I think in 2007 will again see production decline and again that’s grade and strip related and then we kind of turn the corner, but again as we’ve said several times of the last couple of years, Yanaconcha you know has gone through those real easy years, it’s becoming a more mature operation and while 2007 has a fair amount of strip, and that will affect the cost structure, longer term you know Yanaconcha is going to settle in to kind of a you know 230, 250 cost structure there.  The key thing is in the out years being able to bring production back up a little bit, but we’re in the big decline now with 2006, 2007.  We’re building a gold mill down there.  We’re looking at the development of the Conga project which again is further out, it’s in a 2010 time period, but this is a wonderful district.  It has always performed very well but clearly we’re past its prime date and so it’s a matter of it settling down, but it will be a very good long term producer with very competitive cost for us.  Not going to be at $140, $150 an ounce unfortunately.
Dave Gagilano: Okay, and in terms of for modeling purposes in terms of the order of magnitude of the production decline, in ’07 versus ’06?
Wayne Murdy: If you look at the 10Q and that comes out.  Pardon me, the 10K, there’s good guidance that we’ve been giving there and will be pretty consistent.
Randy Engel: Dave, it’s Randy as well.  If you refer back obviously to last quarter’s Q and the previous quarters Q, a 10% to 20% decline in ’06 over ’05 and then we showed another 35% decline in 2007 over 2006.
Dave Gagilano: Perfect.  And just a follow question unrelated.  Realized gold price in the third quarter noticeably lower than spot, is that just a timing issue?  Is there anything we should be looking at there?
Russell Ball: Dave, Russ.  It was timing and then also we had 150,000 ounces that we delivered at $350.
Dave Gagilano: Okay.
Russell Ball: Yeah, price capped.
Dave Gagilano: Any of those price capped out as far as ’06?
Russell Ball: No there’s nothing for ’06 or ’07.
Dave Gagilano: Okay.
Russell Ball: The only items that we will be delivering at non spot is the prepaid forward which is 161,000 ounces, June ’06 and June ’07 and that has a structure that allows us to participate up to $380 and then we’re capped out.
Dave Gagilano: Okay.  Thanks.
Operator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ron Duddy, Gold Stock Analyst.
Ron Duddy: Gentlemen, great quarter an annual rate of 7.2 million ounces a year equity basis.  I’m carrying the most recent public statement that I have for you has a total production for ’07 of around 7.7 million ounces.  Is that still in the range of reaching?
Wayne Murdy: No, I’m not sure where you got that from, but we’ve been very consistent in our guidance for this next year.  The guidance that we’ve put out is 6.25 equity ounces.
Ron Duddy: No I mean for ’07, 2007?
Wayne Murdy: We’ve never given specific guidance for ’07.
Ron Duddy: I think maybe at Denver, but okay.  And my other question has to do then with the cash cost.  Obviously the fourth quarter of ’05 benefited from higher production to cut the cash cost to $230 and then it’s going to jump up to $283, I’m just taking the mid point for all of ’06.  Give us some kind of sense on how it gets to $283?  Does it pop right up the first quarter or is it sort of increasing through the year?
Wayne Murdy: A significant portion of it as I pointed out is the accounting changes.  We used to be able to capitalize deferred stripping and amortize that, so there’s a fairly significant swing there that take place and that will take place right from the beginning.  Again, we give annual guidance and we’ve stayed away from quarterly guidance.  It’s like you’re 2.4 million comment for the fourth quarter.  We typically do better at the end of the year, but you can’t take our guidance and divide it by four, it just doesn’t work that way.
Ron Duddy: Okay, so the first quarter is going to be fairly close to the $283 number?
Wayne Murdy: It will be what it is.  I mean we give guidance for the year.
Ron Duddy: Okay, great.  Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you.  And our next question comes from Mark Smith, Dundee Securities.
Mark Smith: Just have a couple of really quick questions.  With regard to Boddington, when – are you guys going to consolidate that or equity account that?
Richard O’Brien: The legal structure is actually an undivided interest so we will probably be equity accounting for it.  I say probably because proportional accounting.  I say probably because the accounting profession continues to look at this.  It’s not clear that by 2008 when we get into production what the rules will be.
Mark Smith: Okay.  No, that’s fine.  Okay, so when you said $900 to $1 billion capital that was entirely Newmont’s portion of val on an equity basis..
Bruce Hansen: That’s correct.
Mark Smith: Okay.  And this year your capital guidance for 2006 does that include any capital for Boddington?
Wayne Murdy: Yes it does.
Russell Ball: It includes our original share, Mark, which was 49, but that’s stepping up with the Newcrest acquisition it will be about another 47 million a year.  So there will be a delta for a change in scope.
Mark Smith: So what is the exact number now for 2006 for Boddington?
Russell Ball: It’s an additional 47 million, again depending on how the project develops and how the expenditures go.
Wayne Murdy: We’re looking in aggregate at about $200 million to Newmont’s account for Boddington in 2006.
Mark Smith: Okay, that’s cool.  That’s good.  Just another quick question.  Just on the same note because we’re switching back from consolidated to equity accounting.  When you give your guidance for capital expenditures for 2006 over all, does that include the 100% of Yanaconcha and Batu Hijau or is that just your equity portion of Batu Hijau and Yanaconcha?
Wayne Murdy: That’s consistent with the financial statement so it is the consolidated total.  So it’s 100% of Batu and 100% of Yanaconcha.
Russell Ball: All of those numbers in the release look at our financial guidance for ’06 are on a consolidated basis.  So the same logic would apply for the exploration.
Mark Smith: Yeah, but you don’t to that much exploration on Batu Hijau right now, right? It’s hard to break that out.  Okay.  Thanks Russ, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you.  There are no further questions at this time.  I will return the meeting back over to Randy Engel for any closing statements.
Randy Engel: Okay.  We want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today.  Again, reminding you if you have follow up questions you’d like to report to us, you can reach either the Investor Relations Group or the Media Group on the numbers posted at the end of the Release.  Thank you very much for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s teleconference and have a great day.  You may disconnect at this time.
