===== 2024 Q4  (2025-03-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to remove it, you may press star followed by two. Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Vice President, Investor Relations. Go ahead.
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for The Kroger Co.'s fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by The Kroger Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Rodney McMullen, and interim chief financial officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Rob. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today. Before we begin, I'd like to just share a few comments. The Kroger Co. has always been committed to its enduring values. This has been true for The Kroger Co. since my first job in the summer of 1974 working in the Fort Mitchell, Kentucky store. In many ways, I grew up at The Kroger Co. Working summers in college, and then full time for ten years. Following business school, I've held various roles in stores and in manufacturing, human resources, marketing strategy, and sales. The Kroger Co. has really been a special place throughout my career in retail. And I'm just as proud to be a Kroger associate today as I was then. I will be serving as the interim CEO as we search for a leader for our next phase of growth. The board has formed a search committee and has engaged a nationally recognized search firm. We look forward to updating you as we have more information. As a board member, I know The Kroger Co.'s strong leadership team well. And they support the unique culture that powers the company's long-term success. We care for people, and we love food. Most important elements of successful grocery retail. Today, The Kroger Co. operates from a position of strength. We delivered strong financial results in 2024 and have positive momentum in our business. We're confident in our plans for 2025, and our commitment to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. I will be especially focused on executing with speed, and confidence, keeping our teams working toward the priorities that create long-term growth. We're delivering on our go-to-market strategy, providing families across America with fresh and affordable food. In my retail career, I understood that an outstanding customer experience comes from best-in-class store conditions, friendly associates, and great products at low prices. That's who The Kroger Co. is today. And that's who we will be tomorrow. I'll turn the call over to Todd to recap our 2024 performance, and how our value creation model allows us to deliver on our goals. He will then recap our financial results for the fourth quarter, and full year 2024, and then cover 2025 financial guidance. Todd?
Todd Foley: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger Co. achieved solid results in 2024, demonstrating our value creation model strength and diversity. Our performance improved as the year progressed, and our momentum positions us well for growth as we head into 2025. Offering fresh, high-quality products with personalized offers through a unique seamless shopping experience led to strong customer engagement trends, including growth in both households and loyalty. As a result, we are growing sales and generating traffic, which accelerates growth opportunities in other areas including alternative profit businesses. We are confident in our ability to build off this base from 2024 and deliver growth in 2025. Before we get to 2025, I'd like to start with a recap of last year. Beginning with our customers. We saw customers adjust their spending habits, responding to ongoing macroeconomic factors. The effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates pressured spending from budget-conscious households. Meanwhile, spending from less budget-conscious households was more resilient. And our most favorable household trends were driven by our core mainstream customers. Our go-to-market strategy positioned us well to meet our customers' needs, growing households and enhancing loyalty. We helped customers save in multiple ways, through fresh, affordable products and promotions, including loyalty discounts, personalized offers, and fuel rewards. And also through our brands' products, which are priced well below national brands at equal or greater quality. Our focus on operational excellence through our full fresh and friendly strategy brings our strategic pillars to life, meaning our customers can have value, selection, and convenience. We will continue to improve our customer experience to drive traffic, and increase volumes because it powers our value creation model and is critical to our long-term success. Fresh is one of the primary determinants of where customers shop. And we continue to invest to offer more days of freshness. In 2024, we reduced dwell time in our distribution centers, which meant most customers had extra days of freshness in their homes on key fresh items. As a result, we saw strong year-over-year identical produce sales improvement, above our total company identical sales without fuel results. Going forward, we see more opportunities to enhance our sourcing capabilities and supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness. Onto our brands, Our brands is an important differentiator for our business. Providing The Kroger Co. the ability to offer unique and high-quality products at an exceptional value. We expanded our multi-tiered our brands product portfolio in 2024. Resulting in more than 90% of customer households purchasing our brand's items last year. Over time, we built distinct brands that are customer favorites. We're always listening to our customers to understand how we can create more offerings to better meet their needs. Our proprietary customer insights drive our innovation, and led to more than 900 new our brands products released last year alone. Including 370 fresh items. We look to create destination items that can only be found at The Kroger Co., differentiating ourselves from competitors and national brands. Last year, we introduced Field and Bind, a new brand offering regionally grown berries. We also began refreshing existing product lines and rolling out new packaging, which reinforces product quality and improved shoppability. Turning to Seamless, Digital sales were strong in 2024 with more than $13 billion in sales. As our digital business grows, so does its impact on our financial results. As a result, we're making improved profitability a key priority through automation, new technology, and improved density and volumes. We are encouraged by our fourth quarter results, which delivered the best digital profit improvement quarter we've seen yet. Seamless is an important growth accelerator in our business. Capturing more digital households is important to accelerating growth in our model, because these households are more loyal and spend nearly three times as much as non-digitally engaged households. The additional households and traffic in turn create more growth opportunities in our alternative profit and health and wellness businesses. The Kroger Co.'s alternative profit businesses are high growth and margin rich. Alternative profit businesses delivered solid results in 2024, generating $1.35 billion in operating profit driven by a 17% increase in media. Excluding the 53rd week in 2023. While our pool of alternative profit businesses fell short of our initial growth expectations in 2024, in part due to slower growth in advertiser spend, we expect both near and long-term growth to exceed our 2024 results. 2025 is off to a strong start. With increases in upfront commitments. From both CPGs and agencies. KPM's mission is to be the most trusted and transparent media company. By offering advertisers more effective ad spending through a compelling combination of custom audiences and ad effectiveness measurement. KPM continues to make strategic decisions designed to further this such as their holistic brand building approach with clients. We expect a long runway for growth, will be supported by continued innovation and growth in our digital sales. Health and wellness delivered solid sales results, gaining momentum in the second half of the year as strong vaccine performance in the second half helped offset margin pressures from growth in GLP-one sales. Last month, we announced a new agreement with Express Scripts, which will provide ESI customers access to prescription medications and health services at The Kroger Co. pharmacies. While exiting this relationship in 2022 was a difficult decision, we are pleased to renew this relationship under a fair and more equitable contract. Which enables us to operate on a sustainable basis and keep prices low for customers. As our teams begin to welcome these patients back into our stores, we know it will take time to build the ESI business back up. As a result, our 2025 guidance does not assume any benefit from our recently signed agreement with ESI. Improving productivity is a core competency for The Kroger Co., essential to our value creation model. Our focus on productivity initiatives which preserve and enhance both the customer and associate experience. For example, we introduced a virtual AI-powered assistant for associates last year. Today, almost 70,000 associates engage with this tool for more than 70 use cases. It provides personalized service to associates for common HR and associate interactions including training and onboarding. It also provides leaders real-time and convenient access to labor data. Ensuring fully staffed stores. Our efforts to improve strength provide another example where productivity improvements directly connect to our strategy and improve customer experience. Last year, we launched a new generative AI-powered sell-through tool that uses real-time sales and shipment data that empowers associates to better manage fresh and center store inventory. As a result, our products are fresher, we prioritize sell-through, and that optimizes both sales and margins. I'll now walk through our financial results. Beginning with the fourth quarter. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.4%. These results reflect positive momentum in our grocery business, along with strong pharmacy and digital sales growth. Our brands had another strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands, led by growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Encouragingly, our positive sales trends were broad-based across many of our food categories. The FIFO gross margin rate excluding rent, depreciation, and amortization fuel in the 53rd week of 2023 increased four basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. The improvement in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of The Kroger Co. Specialty Pharmacy and lower shrink partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The operating general administrative rate, excluding fuel, adjustment items in the 53rd week, increased 16 basis points in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period last year. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of The Kroger Co. Specialty Pharmacy, increased incentive plan costs, and investment in associate wages. Partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. After adjusting for the effect from the sale of The Kroger Co. Specialty Pharmacy, our OG and A rate improved this quarter, demonstrating our ability to leverage expenses when achieving our long-term sales algorithm. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.2 billion. We had a LIFO charge for the quarter of $30 million compared to a credit of $18 million for the same period last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, which is flat compared to the same period last year, excluding the 53rd week. I'll then walk through our full year 2024 results. The Kroger Co. achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 1.5%. Digital sales grew 10% compared to last year, excluding the 53rd week. And delivery solutions led sales growth with an 18% increase. Demand across our The Kroger Co. delivery network continued to be strong, with an increase in both households and traffic. Customers enjoy the premium experience of our delivery service, reflected by consistently strong net promoter scores. Health and wellness was also a strong driver of sales this year. Led by growth in GLP ones. The FIFO gross margin rate excluding rent depreciation, amortization, fuel, and the 53rd week of 2023 increased 32 basis points. The improvement in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of The Kroger Co. Specialty Pharmacy our brand's performance, and lower shrink, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The improvement in FIFO gross margin rate reflects progress on our long-term margin enhancement strategies. Going forward, we continue to see more opportunity for improvement through our brands growth in alternative profits utilizing technology through our supply chain. Enhancing our product mix through fresh, improving digital profitability. So The OG and A rate excluding fuel adjustment items in the 53rd week of 2023 increased 31 basis points. The increase in rate was driven by the sale of The Kroger Co. Specialty Pharmacy, increased incentive plan costs, and increase in cost due to severity of general liability claims, and investment and associate wages. Partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiative. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.7 billion. Our LIFO charge for the full year was $95 million compared to LIFO charge of $113 million last year. Adjusted EPS was $4.47 per diluted share. Excluding the 53rd week in 2023, EPS declined 2%. Fuel is an important part of The Kroger Co.'s strategy and offers an important way to build loyalty with customers. Through the fuel rewards on our The Kroger Co. Plus program. Fuel sales were lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to fewer gallons sold and lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also behind the same period last year, as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin. On both the fourth quarter and full year basis, fuel was a headwind to our results. I want to provide a brief update on our inflation expectations. Inflation in 2024 increased throughout the year and was in line with our expectation. And as we look ahead to 2025, we expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2% and which does not include the effects from tariffs. Announced earlier this week. External factors continue to pressure certain fresh commodities, including eggs. Notably, the avian flu resulted in egg inflation of approximately 70% during the quarter. Inflationary pressures are not new to our business. And we're confident in our ability to navigate any inflationary environment we will remain focused on keeping prices low on our customers. I'd like to take a moment to talk about our associates. We respect and reward our associates because their success enables the success of the company. Ensuring they are successful means improving wages and benefits, focusing on associate well-being, and developing talent to create fulfilling careers. This approach improved retention as our store and enterprise retention rates reached record levels here. Creating a better associate experience has benefits for our business. When associates stay longer, they're better operators and deliver a better customer experience. In 2024, we raised the bar on our customer experience metrics and our associates exceeded those higher expectations to deliver an exceptional customer experience that drove sales growth. These associated investments include associate wage increases in 2024, resulting in an average hourly rate of more than $19 an hour. And a rate of more than $25 with comprehensive benefits factored in. Over the last seven years, The Kroger Co. has increased wages by 38%. The Kroger Co. remains committed to supporting our associates with investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that are sustainable, and will allow us to keep prices low for our customers. Similar investments in associates are incorporated in our 2025 guidance, and long-term growth model. During the fourth quarter, we ratified several new labor agreements, including our Fred Meyer Alaska stores. With the UFCW. I'd like to now turn to capital allocation and financial strategy. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide a significant financial flexibility to invest in our business and drive returns for our shareholders. At the end of the fourth quarter, The Kroger Co.'s net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.79. Compared to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target ratio range 2.3 to 2.5. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent and are designed to accelerate our value creation model to deliver on total shareholder return at 8% to 11% over time. We are focused on investing in projects that will maximize return on invested capital over time while remaining committed to maintaining our current investment grade rating growing our dividend over time, subject to board approval, returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2024, we announced our plans to significantly increase our investment in major storing projects. Including new stores to accelerate sales growth and improve share, while supporting our long-term growth model. We delivered on that commitment in 2024, completing 29 major storing projects focused in higher growth geographies that have a track record for generating strong cash flows and returns. We expect to complete 30 major storing projects in 2025. We also expect new storing to continue to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth model and would expect new store openings to accelerate beyond 2025. In December, we delivered on our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders as we announced a new $7.5 billion repurchase authorization. Under this authorization, The Kroger Co. entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $5 billion of common stock. During the fourth quarter, The Kroger Co. initially purchased 65.6 million shares as part of the ASR. The ASR program is expected to be completed by no later than the third quarter of The Kroger Co.'s fiscal 2025. After completion of the ASR, expect to resume open market share repurchases under the remaining $2.5 billion authorization that will further enhance shareholder value. Last year, The Kroger Co. issued $10.5 billion in new debt financing. Of which $4.7 billion was redeemed when the merger terminated. Leaving The Kroger Co. with $5.8 billion of new debt. Given this higher debt load, we expect interest expense to increase in 2025. Assuming current interest rates, we expect full year net interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million. The net impact of our financing and the share reduction from ASR created one cent of accretion to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Turning now to 2025 guidance. We expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 2% to 3%. Adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.60 to $4.80. We expect the LIFO charge to be approximately $130 million assuming inflation is in line with current expectations. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be consistent throughout the year. Building slightly as the year progresses. As we continue to improve our volumes. We expect first quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be similar to last year, and we expect quarter two through quarter four to be consistently above each quarter compared to the same periods of last year. In terms of margin rates, we expect FIFO gross margin and OG and A rates excluding fuel. And adjustment items. To be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. After excluding the effects of our sale of The Kroger Co. specialty pharmacy business. In closing, we're happy to deliver another year of solid results, which reflect the strength of our model. Investments made to diversify our model have strengthened The Kroger Co., positioned us well to deliver now and invest in the future. We're a more diverse business, and we are excited about the opportunities across our business to deliver future growth. The strength of our model and the momentum in our business support our confidence in achieving our 2025 guidance. And our ability to continue delivering for our customers investing in our associates, and generating attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I will now turn it back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. As you heard from us today, The Kroger Co. operates from a position of strength. And I'm very optimistic about our future. We delivered solid results in 2024, and our performance improved throughout the year. Looking to 2025, we have aggressive plans to build more stores, and improve our share results. Attract new households, and increase loyalty which will accelerate growth and create shareholder value. We continue to have a strong balance sheet, which positions us well for the future. Allowing us to invest in our business for growth, while remaining disciplined on returning cash to shareholders. Given our ongoing search for a CEO, The Kroger Co. has postponed its planned Investor Day in April of 2025. We will update investors at a later date it has been rescheduled. In the interim, The Kroger Co. remains committed as always to being accessible and updating you on our strategic priorities. Before we open up for any questions, I want to take a moment to welcome David Kennerly. He'll be joining us next week he will succeed Todd as chief financial officer on April third. David is joining us from PepsiCo Europe. And brings broad and extensive financial experience. We're confident that David's expertise and leadership will help us to continue to deliver on our strategic and financial priorities. Now open it up for questions. And as you might imagine, Todd will handle questions related to strategy and results.
Todd Foley: Thank you.
Operator: Please limit yourself to just one question at a time. Thank you.
Simeon Gutman: Our first question for today comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my question is at the highest level. If you look at the 2025 guidance, it looks like EBIT is expected to grow in the low single digits, 2% to 3%. Within that, can you share how much is coming from the core business versus alternate? And then one follow-up. I don't know if we're able to ask Rodney questions, but good to hear from you, Rodney. I wanted to ask as you and the board approach the succession of CEO, you're obviously sitting on a treasure trove of great operators within the organization. How are you looking at an outside perspective? Because the traditional supermarket channel, not just The Kroger Co., has had mixed market share results over time and it's obviously becoming more complex and the stakes are growing. So thinking about looking at outside talent versus the treasure trove of folks that you're sitting on internally.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Thanks, Simeon. Appreciate that question. So I'll let me let me talk about the guide first, and then I'll turn it over to Rodney, for your CEO succession question. Yeah. We have operating profit growth estimates. You look at the middle of the range, it's it's you're right. It's probably in the 3% range, and we see growth both from the core business and from our alternative profit business. Again, we talked in the comments where we didn't quite hit our expectations for alternative profit, but we do expect that to continue to contribute back in advance of what we saw in 2024 next year. But Rodney alluded to it. I alluded to it on the call. We do have momentum in our core business and do expect solid growth in our operating profit to come from the core part of the business. It's across the store, both center store, Pharmacy, we expect a little bit of growth and alternative profit to contribute to that as well. So, Rodney, I'll turn it over to you.
Rodney McMullen: Hey, Simeon. Great to work with you again. I'll tackle the succession planning question. Just to give you a little of the background, the board updates our specs for CEO every year. It's just part of our annual succession planning process. The reason we do that is because, you know, our business changes every year. And the, you know, environment we operate in changes every year as well. So we are in the process of updating that again. And in terms of the process, the board has formed a search committee. We have begun the search process. We have hired a nationally recognized firm. We are going to be looking at both internal candidates as well as external candidates. But I think most importantly, you know, we're focused on identifying the right leader to drive The Kroger Co.'s growth and enhance shareholder value. You know, I am proud to serve in this role, for as long as needed. But I am absolutely confident that our board will select the right next CEO whether from inside the company or outside.
Simeon Gutman: Thanks, everyone. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Leah Jordan: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into digital a little bit. It sounds like it continues to be a strong channel for you and profitability improved notably this quarter. You know, just looking a bit longer term over the next couple of years, seeing if you could provide more detail on the path of improvement from here. And I guess how much more can lower costs in the retail media growth that seems to be accelerating here can offset other ongoing investments you're making, like price investments in the channel.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Thanks, Leah. I'll start with the digital piece. Again, and you're right. We were really pleased to see the sequential improvement in our profitability in the digital channel. In the fourth quarter. And it was really in in in of the key elements. We saw it in in pickup. We continue to make progress in improving our cost to serve, within our stores, and we also saw it in in the delivery channel. We've talked a lot over time about some of the things that we're doing inside our sheds and in the last mile relative to our sheds. In conjunction with Ocado and working with them to improve that. And so again, we saw it in in both spots. We're not where we want to be. We've alluded to that. We're not where we need to be. But I think the green shoots that we had seen prior to the quarter and the progress we made on those during the quarter I think puts us on a trajectory that if we can maintain that consistently, and string a few quarters together, I think that'll help help get us where we want to be over the long term. So again, we're encouraged, and I think we're on the right path to string a few of those quarters together to be long term. Your other question, if I caught it correctly, was around how we generate value in the business to continue to be able to invest. So we've talked a lot about the levers that we have and the way we go about our strategy. We have as many levers or probably more levers today than we've ever had to try to drive that value in the business. We talk about margin enhancement, initiatives like alternative profit. And again, the consistent, meaningful growth that it provides. Our brands is a margin enhancer, and particularly in this environment, around all customer cohorts are looking for value. We've talked about how successful that has been for us over the last several quarters. And we continue to find opportunities in productivity in all elements of our business. There's productivity in store, but we're such a vast business with so many opportunities, whether it's in our supply chain business in the DCs or transportation. We continue to unlock opportunities to create that value, and that's essential to our model. To be able to invest in price, and to continue to invest in associates. And so every year and 2025 is no different than the years in the past. Our level of investment in both prices and associates is pretty consistent with what we've seen year to year, but that commitment remains because it's essential. To be able to deliver key prices to our customers and invest in our associates. Our associates are the ones that deliver that amazing shopping experience and connect with those customers in all realms.
Leah Jordan: Great. Thank you.
Todd Foley: Thanks, Leah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Been too long. My question is that if we look at your ID sales guidance for this year, you're basically assuming that volumes are flat to probably even down given that your inflation expectation along with what will likely be outperformance from your health and wellness, business due in part to GLP one. So a why is that? And b, Rodney, is there anything that you can do now that you're in the CEO seat to address maybe some of the shortcomings of the business that you observed as a board member? And just a quick logistical question, Todd. Is driving EPS to be flat year over year in the first quarter. You very much.
Todd Foley: Right. Yeah. Michael, let me touch on those. I think I can hit on each of the pieces that you have. The ID guide I think you have, fundamentally have the pieces right. When you look at our inflation expectations for next year and relative to volumes. When you look at the whole year and think about it flat to maybe slightly up, I think that's the right way to think about it. Obviously, coming into the year, we're still slightly negative, but we're driving off what's been continued sequential improvement quarter to quarter, and that trajectory is why. We expect that during the year, we'll flip that over to positive. So I think the combination of those two you think about the business without pharmacy, it gets us to nice growth in the core business. And then when you do layer pharmacy on that, I think that's what puts us right into the middle of the range. So I think you're thinking about those pieces consistently. And then I'll talk too about quickly the flat in q one, to that part of your question. Really, what we saw in q one, it was a couple of things. One, we had some OG and A items when you look at a year-over-year comp. That is really driving that. There were a few there, but the biggest I think, to call out is around some union pension relief that we had a year ago. Where we had almost, like, a pension holiday last year. We're now back to more normal cadence of union pension expenses, and so we're kinda back on our normal case. And I think that's a piece of it. Again, there were a few other puts and takes around that, but I think that's when you looked at that and if you go if you did apples and apples on that, I think the growth that we have in the first quarter would be similar and approximate seeing for the rest of the quarters.
Rodney McMullen: And Michael, great to talk to you again. Great to work with you also. You know, at this point, you know, our 2025 plans are really nailed down. They've been approved by the board. We spent a lot of time in January as a board going through the strategy. And I can assure you at this point that The Kroger Co.'s go-to-market strategy remains unchanged. Will remain focused on creating long-term shareholder value, and on a more personal basis as CEO, I'm going to be focused on making sure our experience and our really talented management teams, and I've really seen that are able to continue to execute with clarity, with speed, and with consistency on those existing strategic objectives. But, Michael, you know me for a long time. I certainly don't plan to be a status quo CEO. But on the other hand, our plans are really solid for 2025, and I'm looking forward to being a part of that.
Michael Lasser: Thank you very much, and good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: Todd, a couple of things on digital. You when you think about growth going forward, particularly in 2025. Do you think it ends up being very similar to 2024 in total, and in delivery? And then when you think about improving the losses, what are the biggest bucket or two, right, is throughput through the sheds. How do you look at that versus delivery density? Right. I think those are two of the biggest buckets. And then lastly, right, when do you know, when do you guys think about you'll be at a place where you want to reaccelerate shed openings you know, from a profit standpoint, that you can now go ahead and do that.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Great questions, John. Appreciate that. Yeah. When you look at 2025, we do expect to see continue to improve in 2025. And, again, particularly, given with the results we saw in the fourth quarter, that's nice momentum going into the year. And when you really talk about whether it's throughput in the sheds, or delivery density, I think it's a little bit of everything. You know, we've talked a lot about there are a lot of pieces of that puzzle that we're working to get better. And every single piece of that is contributing. And again, what we saw in the fourth quarter. There wasn't one magical there wasn't just cost to serve. It wasn't just the last mile. Every single piece of the puzzle continues to incrementally improve, and that's what we're seeing deliver. So over time, it's that trajectory. You know, I think we have several quarters to string together that look like the one that we had. We've talked about sheds. Until we get profitability to where we need it and where we expect it to be, one, and two, what comes along with that is making sure that when we open, the next shed, we're able to do it at a volume level that enables us to hit the ground running. I don't think that was always the case when we opened sheds in the past. So the combination of starting in a volume that matters and at a scalable level of profitability based on what we've been able to execute in our existing sheds I think that'll be the point in time when we get there. Again, I don't think it's imminent, John, but I think it's something that we have momentum towards and that we continue to work towards. Those will be the key factors that we look at in determining when we open that next.
John Heinbockel: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to see if you could unpack a little bit more the ID sales in terms of traffic versus ticket. What kind of inflation did you have in the quarter? And then also on GLP one, how much of an impact was that on ID sales?
Todd Foley: Great. Thanks, Michael. And I presume it sounds like you're referencing back to q four. I think when we look at q four, I think we had contribution from both ticket and traffic during the quarter. And it might have skewed a little bit towards the ticket side of it. We did have a little bit of a tick up on the inflation side, but I do think both contributed to that. And GLP one, I think, you know, we haven't quantified what that looks like relative to GLP one, but I think there's been some talk about what the industry impacts have been on that. And I think our experience has been very similar to what others have talked about.
Michael Montani: Should we be thinking inflation at food at home levels of close to two, absent any more detail?
Todd Foley: Yeah. I think we talked about in the script, Michael, about 1.5% to 2.5% inflation next year. And if you peel that down maybe one layer, there are certainly some key commodities or categories where you're seeing some outside inflation. I think eggs are getting a lot of the headlines, but there's a couple other fresh categories. Maybe beef and some of the other protein categories where you're seeing that. But really, you take those kind of extreme or outlier inflation commodities, and I think the vast majority of our overall portfolio was pretty steady on inflation. We would expect that kind of core of the portfolio to see a little bit of a tick in inflation for next year, you know, this year played out the way we kinda thought and ended the year, you know, little north of 1%, which is what we thought. And I think that moving up from there in 2025 is pretty much our expectation to get to that 1.5% to 2.5% and it'll just be those outsized categories, I think, that maybe push us more towards the middle of that range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the tariff front, I know your guidance at least for inflation, does include the impacts of tariffs. But since it's starting up now, just want to get a sense of exposure there. I'm guessing produce you have some exposure to Mexico, but just any color there. Thank you.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Great question. Certainly a hot topic of late, Rupesh. Appreciate you asking. And you're right. As a domestic retailer, we I think we have less exposure to some of the international tariffs that some of our peers will see. You think of China. We're a really, really small single-digit exposure, I think, from some of the things that we buy from China. One category that maybe has a little bit of exposure in the tariff space is our fresh business. Particularly, you think about produce. But even in that space, when you think about some of the produce we might get from Mexico or Canada, those are still pretty mid-single-digit effect. So it's not a massive especially in that fresh space and that produce space, really, we're closely monitoring that. And where we can with our merchandising and our sourcing teams, are trying to be proactive and looking in those commodities where we have the ability to diversify our supplier base. Maybe the suppliers that are in other geographies that won't be affected by tariffs will be less affected by tariffs. To do what we can in some of those commodities to keep it down. Because being able to do that gives us the opportunity to keep prices low in our store. So the teams are being proactive. Even though it's not a huge impact overall on our business, maybe certainly relative to our peers. It's a great opportunity for us to be proactive and stay out front of it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Ed Kelly: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. And, Rodney, it's good to hear from you. A couple questions for you. First is related to share repo on the balance sheet. You know, as we've heard from you guys for a while now that there really is no good business reason to run below your leverage target ratio. Rodney, I'm curious. Do you still agree with that? And then as we think about, you know, guidance this year, Todd, what specifically is in guidance this year for share repo? If you could just clarify that, please. Yeah. And then the last the second question after you is just around, you know, and the exposure you have to snap and what you've seen historically if there's been cuts there. Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Ed. I appreciate the question, but given my short tenure with the company, I'm going to defer to my good friend, Todd.
Todd Foley: Yeah. No. You bet. Thanks, Rodney. Relative to the guide on the share repo, we obviously have the finalization of the accelerated share repurchase in the plan, which we expect to wrap up in the third quarter. We do have that incremental $2.5 billion authorization on top of that, which we do continue to pick up and execute. On you know, our volumes and presuming that our volumes are consistent with what the repurchases under the ASR are gonna be, we expect to use the majority of that $2.5 billion at the back part of the year. So that's the case. Relative to our leverage ratio, obviously, with the borrowings we took on for the ASR. We bumped that up. We're around 1.8 and gives us a little bit of flexibility there. Versus the top end of our range there at the 2.3 to 2.5. You know, keep in mind, we do have that $2.5 billion share repurchase later in the year that some of that will be dedicated towards using some of the cash that we have on our balance sheet. And we also have a debt refinancing that we'll finance with that. So we do have some business uses for some of that cash. Relative to your last comment on Snap, you're right. It hasn't been that long since I think we had some snap pullbacks a few years ago. And typically, when we see the impacts from Snap on our business, especially coming out of the gate, we'll see that customers prioritize spending on essentials like food initially coming out of the gate, and you'll see more of the reduction in spend and more discretionary categories. So as we keep an eye on what's going on and monitoring what's happening in that space, you know, we'll keep that in mind, but as we experienced two or three years ago when we had the snap challenges, you know, we just we have the ability to flex and pull the levers in our model to make sure we absorb. But at this stage, there are, I think, a variety of proposals out there on exactly what an impact this map would be, if any. And so I think it's premature to us, you know, project what's gonna happen there, but I think we have our eyes on it and we'll lean on our recent experiences on what that might mean for our business when the time comes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ken Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I appreciate the guidance on inflation. And the details there. I wanted to broaden it out a little bit. You know, as we look just at food at home, and, you know, retail and wholesale pricing trends, CPI and PPI, it certainly seems to some observers that the industry, the food retail industry is holding back on maybe passing through some of the wholesale inflation. I realized that PPI is not a pure measure of wholesale prices, but I was just wondering what you guys are seeing out there in terms of the competitive environment, your peers' price investments versus your expectations, and how that kind of informs your decisions to pass along inflation this year.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Good question, Ken. Couple of thoughts. Relative to most of our suppliers, we're not seeing a ton of price increases come through yet. I think maybe we have seen some select price increases particularly, again, as I alluded to earlier, some of the fresh categories that you would expect, like eggs and, again, a couple of the proteins, we have seen that. But by and large, across the broad portfolio, we're not seeing or hearing a lot of chatter about those price increases at this stage. So and that's reflected in some of the thoughts that we gave relative to our inflation guidance and whatnot. For later in the year. As far as, again, relative price investments and whatnot, it's a great question. I mean, the way the customers are thinking about value, we talked about that earlier. Competitive pricing is as important today as it's ever been. And, you know, you've heard us say before, we always assume the next quarter and the next year is gonna be more competitive than the last because that's typically the way that it plays out. But we do continue to monitor where our pricing is at. Relative to our competitors and where those gaps are at. Because we're always striving to keep our prices low. We had nice progress in the fourth quarter. We did improve our gaps with our competitors in the fourth quarter. And we continue to monitor that and our strategy is to continue to drive those investments in price to narrow those gaps. So I think we've had nice momentum in that space over the past couple of quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karen Short of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Karen Short: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and good to speak to you. So just on that last comment, I wanted to clarify. Where you think your price gaps are now versus where they were, say, ten years ago. Because the The Kroger Co. Heyday is you were within 5% to 8% of your largest big box competitor, unlike for, like, items. And then my second question is just when you look at your operating profit, and obviously, we can see the contribution from alternative streams. How do you think about the four-wall operating profit? And I know it's getting increasingly hard to separate the two, but four-wall operating profit versus the alternative because four-wall obviously needs to grow as that is the option of them.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Thanks, Karen. Great questions. On the first relative to price gaps, you know, we measure it at two or three different levels. There's obviously I can price gaps that are observable by looking at shelf tags. Let me even take a step back from that. My comments around being able to narrow those price gaps that I just made applies to each of the scenarios that I'll describe. But we look at it at that level at the shelf tag level, for what the customer sees looking at the shelf, but the other one that we look at, because of our promotional offerings, our loyalty offerings, our fuel rewards, we'll look at kinda that all-in price that our customers get total value from The Kroger Co. and what we see when you look at that all-in level, it's favorable to the 5% to 8% range that you use earlier. So we continue to look at that and look at it on an all-in level, and measure how we're able to continue to reduce that gap. One of the things that we're paying attention to there is that's based on our measurements and what we see. We continue to work and make sure that our customers and what our customers perceive our values are and our price spreads are more closely matches to what that actual value is. And I think, we've got some feedback. I think we have some opportunity there from our customers. So really trying to focus on being a little more simpler in the promotions that we put out there. So it's very clear to them, and they give us the credit for value that we deliver to them. So make sure that they understand that. So that's an important part of what we're doing today. And then relative to operating profit, great question on four-wall and versus operating profit and a very astute observation that they do they are very intertwined. Especially the way that we operate our model. But I think that we see both growth in both of those, and I think it's a pretty even balance when you think about when we look at our operating profit growth, both are contributing, I think, in a reasonably similar range to our overall operating profit growth. Particularly as we look at 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about accelerating your new store opening? So the conventional retail food industry has lost market share over the last few years, but The Kroger Co. is definitely something more aggressive than the rest of the industry. And can you talk about a lot of the strategic thoughts behind that, please.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Great call out, Chuck. One of the reasons as we think about there's a couple pieces of that. One, three or four years ago, as we were ramping up our digital capabilities, some of our incremental capital went into building out those capabilities to get them where we are today. I mean, we're pretty happy with how that's played out. So we're not done with that. We're in continual enhancement mode and maintenance mode to ensure we're delivering where the customers are at. But now that we've got to that mode, we're able to take that incremental capital and put it back into our scoring. Because I think that's an area where when you look at some of our share and our opportunity for growth, I think building out that footprint is an important piece of what we're trying to do. So talked about where we're at this year, where we expect to be next year, and accelerating off of that. The two of those comments go hand in hand because more and more our most loyal customers and our most profitable customers are the ones that engage with us in both modalities, those that engage with us digitally and those that and they also engage with us in-store. And so having the right balance between the two of those I think, gives us an opportunity to build loyalty with our customers, but I also think having those additional that additional physical footprint, is a great lever for us to drive our share. So the two go hand in hand, digital and physical footprint, but because we took a couple of years off there from some of that growth. I think it's an opportunity to get back in and build that out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Krisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter. So I had a question regarding own brands. You launched more than 900 new items in 2024. Can you talk about your plan for the own brand business in 2025? How much newness should we anticipate for the year? What does that distribution look like across maybe opening price points versus your more premium items? And then just lastly, how do you anticipate that they will continue to contribute to gross margin in 2025? Thank you.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Great question. We've talked a lot about our brands this year. Again, it's been a staple in what we go to market with because it hits so many sweet spots. It delivers great quality at a value to our customers, and especially in this environment, that's huge. It's a margin enhancement mechanism for us because of spread with national brands on all of those, and it gives us a point of differentiation and distinction with the innovation. Being able to give our customers something they can't get anywhere else. So it's kinda the ultimate triple play. Relative to our brands. And so because of that, we talk about the 900 items this year. I don't recall what 2023 was, but I believe it was a similar number. This year was not an unusual year for innovation and new items in our brand, so I would expect to see us continue to innovate in that space. And again, when you talk about how much of that newness comes from opening price point or private selection or those kinds of things, our team does and is and continues to do deep dives in each category because each category is a little bit different. To make sure we understand where we stack up against national brands, and where there's substitutability or replaceability relative to national brands. Where our brands might be able to be featured. So it's hard to answer that specifically other than to say, we've been doing these deep dives in on a category by category basis really trying to understand where we need an opening price point, or where we can introduce innovation in private selection. And we're probably maybe a third or forty percent of the way through those category deep dives. I expect those to extend through 2025 and beyond to be able to drive that growth. But I think it'll be an important pillar of what we do for years to come. And I even think we see opportunity in the right categories to really push to expand our penetration in those categories over time. So it's a story you'll continue to hear us talk.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman: Thanks, guys, for taking some questions. Wanted to ask about is there anything you mentioned the pension issue being in the first quarter. Can you share a little more color on that for the rest of the year? And are there any other big pensions this year that you do have to negotiate? I feel like every year there's always one or two that come up, and wanted a little more color on that. Thanks.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Sure, Joe. Yeah. I wouldn't even call it a pension issue. Actually, it was an opportunity from last year where based on contributions that we had made up to that point in time, we didn't have the need to make required contributions for an early part of last year. So last year, we didn't have contributions, and now we're kinda back on our normal. And so that just created that q one comp that a little bit different than what we expect to see for the remaining quarters for the year. So it was just it was a it's actually an opportunity from last year as opposed to a concern or an issue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. Had a couple. Wanted to ask just about your core kind of underlying gross margin at TEG pretty solid expansion really for the last few years. I think this quarter and this year, even came in ahead of plan, but it sounded like this year is planned flat. So just curious if you could talk about what maybe different about this year versus the last couple of years. And I guess, if you can incorporate kind of your plans for your alt profit growth. Sorry if I missed that, but what you're planning on that for this year?
Todd Foley: Yeah. Good question. I think when you look net of Specialty pharma for this quarter, I think it was about it was about thirteen basis points ahead. So it was a little bit ahead. In the quarter, and I think that was that too was reflective of the year. I think what we saw this year, which is good, we've been doing a lot of work in the space. This year, and because we've talked for years the pressure with organized crime and some of the other issues that we've had from a macro space and the strength space. This year was a year where a lot of our efforts in that space have really paid off, not only in strategies around organized retail crime, but you heard us talk the prepared script about the way we're using technology to drive sell-through and help us reduce strength. And so I really think the answer to your question on why was this year such a benefit to budget, I think shrink was one of those. We've talked a lot about our brands and whatnot. I still think we have a little bit of run rate in the shrink space, but I think we'll probably start to cycle that as we get the middle of the year. And whatnot. And we continue to invest in price and whatnot, and we use those margin expansion opportunities to continue to invest in price there. And then the second part of the question that I might have missed I might didn't catch the second part. But oh, sorry.
Kelly Bania: And the all profit growth. Yeah.
Todd Foley: We won't we don't specifically guide to all profit, but we do expect 2025 to see dollar growth, better than what we had come through in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll take no further questions. So I'll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks.
Rodney McMullen: Okay. Thank you, Alex. Thanks for all your questions this morning. They're really much appreciated, and it's also great for me personally to reconnect with some old friends this morning. As you know, before we conclude our earnings call, we'd like to take the time to share just a few comments with our associates who are listening in. I'd first like to send a message of encouragement. To all of our associates. As CEO, I will keep our company focused on retail fundamentals. Running great stores and online delivery, while taking great care of our customers. The Kroger Co. is steady. Because of you, the work you do every day matters. And it is what keeps customers coming back makes The Kroger Co. the place they trust. The Kroger Co. is strong. And we have great momentum going into 2025. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. It's great to be back home, and I look forward to our future together.
Operator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-12-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to The Kroger Co. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Robert Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger’s third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I’d like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our third quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the third quarter and walk through updates to our full year guidance. And finally, I will close with some comments on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning first to our performance, we delivered strong third quarter sales results led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which reflects the versatility of our model. Customer engagement remains strong. Our convenient, Seamless shopping experience, along with incredible customer value through low prices, personalized offers and great quality Our Brand products, drove growth in both total and loyal households. As we entered the last quarter of 2024, we are focused on providing the quality, Fresh and affordable products that make holiday celebrations special. Customer spending habits continue adjusting to current macroeconomic factors. As inflation normalizes, our premium and mainstream households are feeling more confident and are returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns more quickly. Mainstream households are the primary driver of our positive customer engagement trends. While overall consumer sentiment remains low, expectations are improving, which positions us well for the holidays and into next year. As we said, near-term, some customers are managing macroeconomic uncertainty. Spending from budget-conscious households remain under pressure, as the effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates have had a larger impact on these households. Therefore, we expect it will take longer for these households to fill the benefits of economic improvement. Kroger is delivering on its longstanding commitment to provide customers with the value they are seeking. We are helping customers save in multiple ways, including competitive shelf prices and loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and an expanded multi-tier Our Brands portfolio. Digital offers are an important way we deliver savings to customers and engagement continues to grow. With 5% more digital offer clips so far this year and that has led to 14% more savings for Kroger customers. We are always creating additional ways for our customers to save. This quarter, we celebrated and thanked our customers with a Customer Appreciation Week, offering new great deals, and to help our customers enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, we lowered the price of Thanksgiving meals for the third consecutive year, by creating a meal bundle that served a group of 10 people for less than $5 per person. We are focused on executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. We appreciate our associates’ continued efforts to elevate the customer experience and bringing this strategy to life by improving on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly again this quarter. I would now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy. We are seeing long runways for growth in many areas of our strategy, starting with Fresh. Customers connect strongly to our Fresh for Everyone brand promise, which is a key differentiator for Kroger. Improvements across the supply chain as part of our end-to-end Fresh initiative are increasing days of freshness. For example, bagged salads now offer customers more than seven days of freshness. Customers are noticing and it has led to identical sales in produce of more than 3% this quarter. In addition, we constantly evaluate new ways to apply data and technology to provide an even better Fresh experience and deliver more days of freshness for our customers. One of the ways we are doing this is through recent implementation of RFID-embedded labels on bakery items. These labels provide us with greater insights into our Fresh inventory, resulting in consistently fresher items and higher in-stock levels. We have seen encouraging results, including higher sales, in locations and categories where we have piloted the RFID labels and we look forward to scaling this to more stores. Turning to Our Brands, I would like to step back and talk about the significant investments we have made in Our Brands and how those investments are delivering value to both customers and shareholders. For years, the grocery industry offered private label products with the primary goal of creating products at lower price points. Several years ago, we recognized an untapped opportunity for growth in these products and envisioned a future where our private label products would match or exceed the innovation, quality and recognition of national brands, which is why we coined the phrase, Our Brands. Guided by that vision, our teams built distinct and recognizable brands that our customers want and love, providing more value and meeting unique product needs that national brands cannot fill. Recently, we focused in on refining Our Brand architecture to optimize the portfolio and ensure each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. The successful addition of Smart Way, our new opening price point brand, played an important role in rounding out our multi-tiered portfolio and offering an attractive alternative to national brands at every price point. The next phase of the work involved refreshing designs and packaging, enhancing brand equity, and reinforcing quality and improving the shopability. For example, to reinforce our longstanding guarantee of quality and freshness, we are placing guarantees on labels across our Kroger branded products. Innovation remains a driving force for Our Brands’ growth. We utilize our data and insights to understand customer trends and meet increasing demands by consistently introducing new items to our portfolio with a focus on growth areas, including free-from, organic, and multicultural. This innovation enables us to differentiate ourselves from both national brands and other private label brands, creating destination items that help build customer loyalty. Our manufacturing capabilities will continue to be an important advantage for Our Brands. With oversight over the quality and the supply, we can develop unique and differentiated products while keeping costs low, allowing us to pass the savings to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins, a true win-win for customers and Kroger. This quarter, Our Brands continue to deliver strong financial results, which Todd will cover in more detail. Next, to Personalization. Our Kroger Plus program provides our loyal customers access to savings and rewards that in turn drive traffic to our Seamless experience. As customers become more engaged, we gain deeper insights into customer trends while creating the data that enables us to grow Kroger Precision Marketing and deliver more effective promotions and relevant product recommendations. We are working to grow Boost, the next level of our loyalty program, through new benefits and this quarter we announced the addition of Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ streaming benefits with Boost annual memberships. Turning to Seamless, digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. Within digital, delivery sales grew at 18% and continues to outpace other channels. Boost is one of the important ways we are increasing e-commerce penetration, providing customers an affordable membership model for free delivery. Increasing e-commerce penetration is important to our model, as households who shop with us digitally and are in our stores are our most loyal customers and increase retail media monetization opportunities as well. As our digital business grows, particularly in our delivery network, it continues to have a larger impact on our financial results. Improving profitability is a key priority and becoming even more important to our financial model. Over nearly a decade, we made significant investments in our digital capabilities, building out our own properties, creating distribution channels in both pickup and delivery, investing in automation, enhancing Personalization and introducing an industry-leading retail media network. While each of these capabilities required significant investments, we now have a unique digital experience that our customers enjoy. Moving forward, we are committed to growing volumes, utilizing automation, and introducing new technology that will create efficiency gains while helping us narrow the profitability gap between online and in-store. Narrowing that gap will generate meaningful operating margin benefits and help drive shareholder value over the next several years. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty, increasing customer engagement and creating more growth opportunities, first with alternative profit businesses, which had another solid quarter. Kroger Precision Marketing continued to deliver the most significant growth from our alternative profit businesses. Next, in Health & Wellness, as the pharmacy industry continues to transform, Kroger has a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in helping patients live healthier lives while growing our share of the industry. We are excited about this area of the business and its performance. This quarter demonstrates we can grow this business profitably in a way that supports our customers to live healthier lives. Sales and profitability this quarter were well ahead of last year, led by growth in both GLP-1s and vaccines. Our strong growth in vaccines reflect patient trust in Kroger to vaccinate them and their families during the start of the cold and flu season, the peak quarter of the year for vaccinations. Our Health & Wellness teams did an excellent job this quarter in building awareness around our vaccine capabilities, growing share, and administrating significantly more vaccines this year versus a year ago. These helped offset the product mix pressures from GLP-1s. Our vaccine efforts are leading to new patient scripts, which is important as these customers are more likely to become loyal households and spend more across the store. We appreciate our associates for their continued efforts to elevate the customer experience by delivering on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly. Team consistency leads to a better customer experience and we are excited about another quarter of improvement in retention. Our focus on retention reflects a holistic strategy, including investments in wages and benefits, as well as enhancing the associate experience through training, technology and career development opportunities. With that, I will hand it over to Todd to take you through our third quarter financial results. Todd?
Todd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger’s third quarter results reflect the durability of our model with strong pharmacy results that helped offset lower fuel profitability as we cycled strong fuel results from a year ago. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing the ranges on our identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength of our model gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this full year guidance. Before I walk through our third quarter financial results, I would like to start off by covering a couple of items from the quarter that affected our financial results. First, during the third quarter, we finalized the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business for $464 million. The sale reduced total company sales in the third quarter by approximately $340 million, compared to the same period last year, and annualized sales will be approximately $3 billion lower going forward. KSP was a low-margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both Kroger’s gross margin and operating general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit. Second, on a year-over-year basis, the combined hurricane season and port strike had approximately a 20-basis-point favorable impact on sales as customers stocked up in anticipation of these events. These events had an unfavorable impact on OG&A. Together, this did not have a material impact on total operating profit. I’ll now take you through our third quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.3%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales without fuel were led by strong pharmacy and digital sales. We’re also encouraged by the continuation of positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households. Our Brands had a strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands again this quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Customers continue to demand premium products, but at the same time are looking for value. Our Private Selection brand is a perfect solution by offering our customers premium quality at an attractive price. These results demonstrate the breadth of Our Brands portfolio and the ability to meet customers’ needs for quality and value. Digital sales delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led by 18% growth in delivery solutions, driven by our customer fulfillment centers. The CFCs are offering customers a superior digital experience with excellent in-stocks, fresh items and a white-glove on-time delivery. CFC growth was driven by a significant increase in households and trips, as well as an increase in basket size. Our third quarter identical sales without fuel results were affected by the Boar’s Head recalls that began in the second quarter. We acted quickly, with the safety of our customers in mind, as soon as we became aware of the situation. Boar’s Head is a strategic supplier with brand-loyal customers that are an important driver of our deli sales. As a result, some customers have temporarily migrated away from the category. It will take some time for those customers to resume their prior purchasing behavior and we expect this to remain a headwind to sales in the near term. The unfavorable sales effect from Boar’s Head this quarter was largely offset by the favorable sales impact from the hurricane and port strike. Turning to margins, gross margin was 22.9% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 51 basis points compared to last year and was ahead of expectations. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands performance and lower strength, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger’s ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. Excluding the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, fuel and adjustment items, our OG&A rate to sales would have been nearly flat year-over-year, demonstrating that our model can leverage expenses when we achieve our long-term ID sales without fuel goal of 2% to 4%. This is made possible by a relentless focus on productivity and cost savings initiatives, which remain an essential part of our model. These initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience. This quarter, we launched a new, internally developed, generative AI-powered sell-through tool, which helps us better manage inventory in both Fresh and center store departments through real-time insights tracking sales and shipments. This enables our teams to increase freshness on shelves and prioritize sell-through, optimizing both sales and margins. Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance the AI capabilities on this platform by extending into improved forecasting and end-to-end inventory management. During the third quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million, compared to a charge of $29 million for the same period last year, due to lower expected year-over-year inflation. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS was $0.98 per diluted share, an increase of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy. Fuel rewards, through our Kroger Plus program, help build customer loyalty. Fuel sales were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to a lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also meaningfully behind a year ago, as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, as it remains a topic of interest for many investors. Inflation was down slightly in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, but remains around 1%. We expect inflation to remain consistent in the fourth quarter. I would now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for Dillon’s Columbia, Missouri clerks, Central Division, Ottawa and Streeter clerks, Northern Illinois meat clerks, Fred Meyer Portland retail stores and the Foods Co. contract in Northern California, all covering nearly 13,000 associates. We respect associates’ right to collectively bargain. We’re also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. These proposals stand in the way of operating our business in a way that ensures job security and advancement opportunities for associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Free cash flow generation is an important part of our model and is enabling us to invest in our business for growth. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger’s net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.21, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. We’re committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. I would now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. After delivering solid third quarter results, we’re narrowing the ranges of identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, we have updated our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate and expect it to be 22.5%. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the year to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5%. With quarter-to-date trends signaling, we will be near the midpoint of this range. Identical sales without fuel results year-to-date have largely been in line with our expectations, with Q3 being slightly ahead of expectations due to favorable effects from the hurricanes, the port strike and strong vaccine growth during the peak season for immunizations. Our expectations for fourth quarter identical sales without fuel are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year. We expect Q4 identical sales to remain strong, but sequentially lower than third quarter, partially due to the cycling of weather benefits from the fourth quarter of 2023 that are not built into our current forecast for Q4 2024. We now expect adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. Looking to next year, we are in the process of finalizing our 2025 business plan, while we still have many unknowns, we do expect Kroger to deliver FIFO operating profit growth on a standalone basis. During our fourth quarter earnings call, we plan to share our full year 2025 outlook in more detail. In closing, we are happy to deliver another quarter of strong results, which reflect the resilience of our value creation model. While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our model has multiple levers which enable us to navigate any environment, including grocery, Health & Wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses. This gives us flexibility in the ways we create shareholder value and confidence in our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up to Q&A, I’d like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business while also preparing for the merger. I would like to extend a special thanks to those who supported the litigation in federal and state courts, both the associates who testified and the teams who prepared a compelling case about the meaningful and measurable benefits of the merger. Our teams are ready to ensure a Seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers with an even better experience. As we await the court rulings and the regulatory challenges to the merger, we remain confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive and we know how our customers shop. Every day they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors, from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. And as I’ve said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. Our strong free cash flow and strengthened balance sheet provides us with the ability to invest in our business and enhance shareholder value. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are still in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman: Good morning, Rodney, Todd. My question is on the P&L for 2024. If you take out the extra week lap and then you pull out some of the merger-related costs, the big ones, it looks like the core business is growing pretty nicely on EBIT and really nicely, potentially mid-single, even high single-digit percentage, and that’s despite lower fuel profitability and the environment’s been pretty tough. So first, is that a fair characterization and is it mixing the way you would have thought between the core business and the alternative? Thanks.
Todd Foley: Great question, Simeon. Thanks for that and I think that’s a fair read on how you’ve described it. We were obviously very happy with the results that we’ve seen coming from not only the core business but inclusive of pharmacy, particularly pleased with the results we saw in pharmacy, you heard Rodney talk about today. So despite that lever in fuel giving us a headwind this quarter, we were pleased with the core growth coming from the core business and see that continuing. The mix relative to alternative and core business, I think the growth expectations that we have around the alternative profit business are relatively consistent to what we expected to see and so I think that those continue to be as balanced as we expected going into the quarter.
Rodney McMullen: And longer term, as everyone knows, the alternative business -- profit businesses will continue to see a great opportunity and the margins on that business is meaningfully higher than the supermarket business, and the whole flywheel between our brick-and-mortar business and our Seamless business pickup and delivery is the engine behind driving that continuation there, which we’re very excited about.
Todd Foley: That’s a great call, Rodney. We saw the digital growth again at low double-digit growth, which is an important part of the growth that you talked about, Simeon. And that, again, when you talk about mix in our business and our omnichannel, that low double-digit growth is right on what we expected and helps drive both the core business and the alternative profit as Rodney described.
Simeon Gutman: And the one follow-up, this is more towards a comment Rodney made. All year, we talked about the mainstream, the premium and the lower end. It felt like there may have been an inflection whereas the mainstream has been resilient and the premium has been healthy. I thought your comments today on mainstream inflected a little more positively. I’m not sure if that’s reading too much in. Lower income sounds about the same. Curious if that’s fair.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. The mainstream customers certainly performed, connected with us better in the third quarter than the second quarter. How much of that is driven because of things we did and how much they’re just feeling better, we don’t know. Now they’re telling us they feel better. And certainly customers that are on a budget continue to be under a lot of strain and the accumulation of inflation and other aspects and higher interest rates continue to affect them more. And I think the other thing that’s always important to remember is, that customer in many cases are starting out in careers and things and they don’t have as many physical assets on a house or a little bit of savings and those things, and those -- inflation obviously affects that person a little harder than others. Thanks, Simeon.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So just going back to your guidance, so you did narrow the operating profit ratio to the lower end of the range for the full year. So just curious what’s driving that.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. Todd, I’ll let you start.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Well, with one quarter left, Rupesh, we wanted to try to narrow the range because there should be less variability in our expectations. When you look at the sales part of the guidance down at 1.2% to 1.5%, I think, that’s pretty consistent with what we’ve been thinking for the year. The midpoint on that range is a tick higher than I think what we had been thinking before. And frankly, when you look at where we expect to be in Q4, I think that’s right on how we’ve been thinking about it all year relative to all of that. Q3 actually is the one that was really strong and we talked about -- Rodney talked about the pharmacy and the digital growth there, particularly in the vaccine space. We were really pleased. We’ve been working hard to grow our vaccine business and we saw that throughout the quarters early in this year, but with Q3 being that key vaccine, the Super Bowl season for vaccines, we were really pleased to see that that growth continue and that it paid off in that point in time. So that’s where we saw Q3 being really strong and that Q4 guidance being really what we expected. When you look at it on the EPS side of our guidance through past again, narrow the range there. We took a nickel off the top side and the bottom side and really that midpoint of the range is pretty consistent with where we’ve been thinking about it for the year. As we think about that range and some of the key factors for that range in the fourth quarter, a couple of key things that we’re keeping an eye on. One is weather. We alluded to it in our prepared comments. There were several meaningful weather events a year ago that drove some benefits and we just don’t forecast weather on a forward-looking basis. So if we see the number and magnitude of weather events in the fourth quarter this year, I think that would be something that could push us towards the higher end of that range. And then the other one is fuel. And certainly we -- fuel tends to be pretty volatile and we’ve seen that this year and really we have fuel expectations to be pretty in line with where they were last year. And frankly, from a gallon trend and from a $0.01 per gallon trend in the fourth quarter, we’re pretty consistent sequentially from where we’ve been performing over the last few periods. So if we have variance in the fuel profitability, either positive or negative, I think that could lean us towards the top or the bottom end of that range, respectively.
Rodney McMullen: Todd said this, but I think it’s important to just highlight it. If you look at the range for the year, fuel in the third quarter was a tougher quarter than what we expected it to be and that really relative to the top side. And the other thing that Todd mentioned, we don’t budget weather because we just don’t know. Obviously there’s been some major storms, but those storms haven’t been in places where we operate stores. So it really hasn’t affected us so far. And generally that’s a positive when we have weather because people eat at home as opposed to going to restaurants.
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. And then my very quick follow-up question, just on the Boost membership, you added the Disney perk as well. Just overall, are you guys happy with the signups you’re seeing and the retention with that program?
Rodney McMullen: I would say we’re very happy, but the thing that I guess I get more excited about is the potential, because it’s an incredible value for customers and customers love it and we have a high renewal rate and a high NPS score. So our job is to continue to educate more customers on it. So I’m really more excited about the opportunity going forward and the overall deeper connection with customers. So great question. Thanks, Rupesh.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Leah Jordan: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and thanks for the commentary on inflation this morning and how you’re thinking about it in the fourth quarter. But as you plan with your vendors and seeing if you can add more color on how you’re thinking about inflation into next year, what are you seeing across categories and hearing from those partners?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. No. A great question. Maybe still a little early to think about next year, but you think about where we were this year, obviously, coming into the year, we were coming out of that crazy disinflation that we had a year ago. And inflation has played out more or less the way we expected. It’s maybe a little bit less than what we expected, but it’s been relatively stable at just under 1%. Maybe even saw, I think, a slight step back in Q3 relative to Q2, which as we said, we expect to see for next year. As we look to next year at this point, looking at both some of the macro and governmental studies, as well as conversations with vendors. Again, it’s still early to tell. And we might see a slight expansion to inflation next year, but really don’t expect to see anything meaningfully different or inconsistent with what we’re kind of seeing right now with inflation.
Todd Foley: We are continuing to see CPGs be a little more aggressive on trade dollars, and over time, that obviously affects inflation a little bit as well.
Leah Jordan: Great. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow-up on some of your Fresh initiatives. I know you’ve been working on improving days of freshness in produce for a while, so great to see some improvement there. But it seems like the RFID tags within bakery is new to me. Just wanted more color there, what degree of lift are you seeing when you add that to the category? How many of your stores have it today and how should we think about the rollout over time?
Rodney McMullen: Well, we are -- as I mentioned, we’re testing it. We’re happy with the initial result. The benefits are as much helping our associates be able to do their job a little bit easier. And it’s too early -- it’s early enough to be excited about the potential. It’s too early to say this much we can budget in terms of what we would do. But the thing that we’re excited about for our customers, it’s helping us make sure we have fresher product for the customer and stay in stock better. And it’s super exciting. We will look at other areas of the store to see what kind of opportunity it is. The cost per tag is still higher than we would like, so we still need to continue to work on focusing on the get the cost per tag down. But positive early results, really early in the process and excited about the potential. Thanks, Leah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ken Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the topic of next year. I appreciate it’s too early for specifics and I’m not asking for any numbers. But to Simeon’s question, you agree that it’s a fair read that the core underlying business is doing very well. I think those are the words, despite when you ex out the merger cost and the digital mix and fuel and so forth. And you talked a little bit about inflation being sort of steady and predictable and consistent in that low-single-digit range. Are there any other unusual tailwinds or headwinds that we should consider just directionally as we think about next year? Just trying to get a sense for what would kind of throw you off from having another reasonably good year. You did say that operating profit would be up, but you didn’t kind of tell us how much and your longer term algo is 3% to 5%, of course?
Rodney McMullen: And it would be way too early to tell you specifics, and obviously, we’re waiting for the ruling on the merger, which will affect guidance as well. The other thing that I guess from a positive standpoint that I’m excited about, in the third quarter, we opened or expanded the most number of stores that we’ve done. I think it’s actually in a quarter in seven years. And as you know, last year we talked about it that we will open more stores this year than we have in several years and we would expect to continue to open more stores. And so far, the stores that we’ve opened, we’re happy with the way they’re connecting with customers and we’re happy in terms of the volumes they’re creating and the early read on the profitability of the stores as well. So over time, we would hope that that would continue to be a tailwind, and obviously, on Seamless, we continue to see that as really critical to our five-year or 10-year future to be awesome there and we still have a lot of work to do to make where we’re indifferent, whether somebody shops with us online or in-store and we’ll continue to put a lot of effort there. In terms of headwind, Todd, I’ll let you add anything that you can think of.
Todd Foley: I can’t think of anything unusual headwinds or tailwinds as we sit here today, frankly Ken. But going into next year, part of what has us optimistic and feeling good about the strength of our value creation model is a lot of the momentum we have in the things that are in our high growth areas today. We’ve talked about a lot of them already. It’s pharmacy, it’s our digital business, it’s our alternative profit. And we have good momentum in those spaces and are executing on those. And from a headwind standpoint, we’re going to continue to invest in the business. We’re going to invest in price. You’ve heard Rodney say it before. We assume every year is going to be more competitive than the last and that view hasn’t changed. And so we’ll continue to engage in customers, make sure we’re delivering value to them by investing in price and investing in their shopping experience and we’re committed to continue to invest in wages. So some of those are headwinds. They’re just the parts of our model that is we deliver the value in our model through all their different value propositions. We’re able to use that to invest in the business to keep the flywheel moving.
Ken Goldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then speaking about price investments, Rodney, you mentioned that CPGs continue to be a little bit more aggressive on trade dollars. Your largest competitor are in food retail. We’ll see if the judges agree that it’s a competitor or not, but your largest competitor in food retail had more kind of commentary last week or this week about how they would like to see more of those price investments from key vendors. Rodney, your tone, since I’ve known you has always been more sort of agnostic about that. If investors -- if your vendors don’t invest with that, you’ll be happy to sell customers more private label. I’m just curious where you stand in terms of, are you content with the level of price investment or are you more just sort of agnostic and saying, look, whatever our vendors want, it’ll play out either way beneficially for you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I guess a little bit of both. The -- if you look at tonnage growth in CPGs, there’s a lot of CPGs that cannot be satisfied with their tonnage growth. And I believe that trade dollars and being more aggressive on partnering with us to make sure the right customer gets access to those benefits is good long-term for the customer, a long-term benefit for both of us on tonnage. If they’re not willing to do that, it really gets back to the comment that we talked about. Our Brands and Todd and I both mentioned it had a strong quarter, the profitability of Our Brands is several hundred basis points higher than national brand. And if the CPGs are willing to continue to give up share to Our Brands we’re okay with that because what we find is once a customer tries Our Brand, the repeat rate of customers coming back is incredibly high because what they find is they have -- there’s no compromise on quality and they have a great value for the money. So, at the end of the day, the customer wins when they buy Our Brands, but it really is we try to run a business where the customer decides what they want to buy as opposed to forcing them to buy something. Thanks Ken.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ed Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Ed Kelly: I’m curious about the gross margin. You’ve had a couple good quarters on the gross margin front. I think you admit this quarter was better than expected. How are you thinking about gross margin in Q4 and then, even like into, I don’t know, you’re not going to get next year, but sort of like the outlook for the gross margin. And I’m talking like ex-Spec Pharma divestiture and maybe just talk about the puts and takes around that?
Todd Foley: Yeah. No. Great question, Ed. And I think you hit on a key part of thinking about it excluding KSP. We talked about, it was a strong quarter in gross margin and about half of that year-over-year benefit was a result of the divestiture. But the other piece of it really came, we highlighted both of, Rodney, layers and what Rodney was just talking about, what was our growth in Our Brands, where we continue to have Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brands and that is always going to drive solid margin expansion. And so that’s certainly what we saw again in the third quarter, very similar to what we saw in the second and then shrink had another nice quarter. So we’ve got cautiously optimistic on the progress we’re making there, but we are making progress on the shrink space that really helped us in the third. As we look to the fourth, I think, excluding KSP, I think overall we’ll probably be slightly favorable in the fourth, reflecting KSP when you, when you pull that out, I think, we’ll probably be relatively flat on that relative to some of the puts and takes. Again, if we over index in things like Our Brands and whatnot, but we may be a little bit favorable, but overall, I think we’ll be, we’ll be relatively consistent relatively flat year-over-year on the margins in Q4.
Rodney McMullen: I totally agree with everything Todd said. And Todd said the big pieces, I would also add a couple of smaller pieces that’s helping on gross margin that should continue is if you look at our warehouse and transportation costs, continue to make some progress there and the customer continues to buy more value-added product and Fresh continues to grow as well. So those are things that help on mix and in addition to things that Todd talked about.
Ed Kelly: And just to Rodney, a quick follow-up, this one’s for you. And you kind of hinted at it or talked about it, but Albertsons would be a transformational deal. How do you feel about Kroger’s position, if the deal is rejected and do you need to hunt for something else more transformational or is it just simply more prudent to double down on what you have and, and reward shareholders for their patients with returning capital?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. It’s a great question. If you look at the balance sheet capacity that we have, there’s probably no -- nothing else that would be transformational that would use the balance sheet capacity that we would have. So I don’t know that we would be out there trying to find what’s the next Albertsons. As you know and you just said it, we track -- we’ve always made sure that we don’t need to do mergers to make our business successful and that was one of the reasons that we’ve always been proud of what Kroger has done. We’re super excited about Albertsons and the potential, and we believe we will be able to add a ton of value for giving customers better value. The people there will be able to provide security and grow our business and create additional career opportunities and support communities, but if it doesn’t happen we’ll continue to go on. As you know, we always will continue to look at how ways to grow the business. Mergers is always one of those ways of growing the business. But we try to make sure that we only do a merger when it makes sense, and we’re not chasing something and we won’t get in a position where we are having to chase something. So great question, and thanks, Ed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As of the second quarter, Kroger had made a point in its presentation that it was on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year and that line was removed this quarter. So is it right to interpret that the media growth, which is an important driver of the alternative revenue stream is starting to slow, perhaps, as there are more adverts -- net more platforms for advertisers to choose and direct its advertising dollars. And if that’s the case, how does Kroger accelerate that element of its algorithm in order to support the long-term outlook for the business?
Todd Foley: Yeah. Let me start there, Michael. Thanks for the question. It’s a good call. We do still expect to see our retail media growth being that in that 20% range for the year. It’s still a fast growing part of our business and the outcomes that we’re seeing continue to demonstrate that we’re well positioned for that growth. As we look at those CPGs that are advertising with us, we see the outsized return on ad spend that they’re generating and so that’s why I say we’re able to demonstrate and we’re seeing those results. And not coincidentally, the sales for those CPGs at Kroger are strong and so I think the proof points continue to be there, but as you say, there’s a proliferation of options as everybody’s kind of got their own flavor of what this is. So I think we just need to continue to demonstrate that the CPGs, because I think the proof will be in the results.
Rodney McMullen: Todd’s last point to me, and if CPGs are listening in, that’s the only reason why I’m adding on top. The CPGs that increased spending the most had the highest tonnage growth with us, which to me is, it shows you the power of our platform and Todd said it, I just wanted to double down on it.
Michael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up question is, what do you need to drive -- what do you need to happen in order to drive The Kroger to achieve the sales piece of its long-term algorithm in 2025? This year, there’s been a contribution from the GLP-1 drug, some storm-related spending, perhaps those won’t be as meaningful contributors next year. So is it that you would be banking on A, market share stabilizing and is that realistic; and B, some acceleration in inflation to offset what had been driving some of the comp this year?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. We would not be dependent on inflation and it’s really we continue to double down on the customer experience. And when we find that we improve the customer experience, our business follows that or the customer rewards us for that. And it’s -- it really gets back to you’ve heard us say it a million times Full, Fresh & Friendly. The other thing that we’re increasingly supporting is allocating capital to growth areas and that would be storing, obviously, continuation of Seamless or online business continues to have outside growth and then specific projects that support cost reductions and sales opportunities.
Todd Foley: Yeah. I agree, everything you said, Rodney, especially the storing that you hit on earlier as well. You mentioned GLP-1 and that certainly has been part of this year, but as we sit here today, I think we continue to expect to see growth in that area as more manufacturers get in the mix and the supply continues to become more available and more and more patients continue to utilize that drug. So I think we’ll still see -- expect to see growth in the GLP-1 space as well for the -- at least near future, foreseeable future.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your lines are open. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel: Hey, Rodney. Can you talk about the, you referenced in your release, the initiatives -- productivity initiatives on in-store order selection and how broadly is that rolled out? And when I think about how much you can take the cost per order down, can you take that down a double-digit from where we are today?
Rodney McMullen: Over time, we would certainly expect to take it down double-digit from where we are today. And when I talk about over time, I’m talking about over the next two years or three years and it’s -- we still have a reasonable amount to roll it out. Now, as you, you followed Kroger long enough to know that we will start -- whenever we roll something out, we start with the biggest opportunity places first. So it’s the highest volume locations and those kinds of things. The thing that I think is fascinating and exciting is, if you look at the fundamental things behind the software, we’re learning that we can actually use that same technology in other areas of the business and I would hope that we’ll continue to find those kinds of opportunities. So I feel confident and comfortable that certainly, well, double-digit type stuff of improvement. But our team’s not going to be satisfied until they get to where it’s indifferent, how somebody shops with us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask first, did I miss the fuel CPG contribution for this quarter? Wondering if you could give some added color there and then just had a follow-up?
Todd Foley: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. We don’t typically -- we stopped a few quarters ago, given in details around CPG. You did catch on to the point that I think that, that Rodney brought out that both gallons and CPG were down in the third quarter. Again, some of the volatility in fuel, but as we looked at the fourth quarter relative to our expectations versus a year ago we think fuel will be a little bit -- our expectation is that fuel will be a little bit more stable year-over-year in Q4 and that’s supported by some of the trends that we’ve seen over the last few periods in both gallons and, and margins.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Robert Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Rodney, I know you set up front and it seems like consumer sentiment is still low, but maybe there are some green shoots, maybe it’s improving a little bit. So I’m just wondering kind of as you got through the Thanksgiving holiday and then as we’re kind of real time in the current holiday season, like you have -- have you seen any incremental almost like sequential traffic improvement in the actual retail stores?
Rodney McMullen: We feel good about where we are. The thing, I guess, I would say that we still don’t quite under, it’ll take time is there’s five less shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we feel good about where we are. We’re tracking a little bit better than where we thought we would be. But we still are cautious because of the five less shopping days and how does that play out? And as you mentioned, we are seeing the customer, most of the customers are starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and comfortable in terms of where they stand and what’s coming -- what -- how things look going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jacob Aiken-Phillips: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to inflation a little bit. So you showed that you were able to kind of leverage SG&A given like flat comps excluding KSP. How do we think about that relationship going forward in terms of wage inflation and wage investment? And then also with tariffs, we’re of the view that it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of like people buying stuff and causing inflation, even if there aren’t actually tariffs happening. I just wanted your thoughts on that.
Todd Foley: Yeah. I’ll start with the wage inflation -- the wage investments. It’s a great question. We’ve talked a lot about how important it is for us to invest in our associates because they’re so critical delivering our customer experience. But we will continue to balance those wage investments with the other profitability enhancement items that we say. So in any inflationary environment and in any sales leverage environment, we’ve demonstrated that our model enables us to pull the levers to be able to balance those wage increases accordingly over time. So given the comments that we said with fairly balanced inflation, we think we’ll be able to leverage our SG&A including wage investments. Rodney, I don’t know if you want to comment on the tariffs.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. Tariffs for us, first of all, the effect on us is probably a little less than most companies and we buy product internationally, but it’s pretty modest. If you look in the Fresh departments, it’s less than 20% of the stuff. If you look in the center store, it’s a fraction of that. So we would see the tariffs affecting others generally more than us and we feel like we’ll be able to manage whatever is done because our competitors will have to deal with the same thing. Thanks Jacob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Rodney, you mentioned that the mainstream and premium customers were pretty close to spending how they had been before COVID. But there also is from what I can observe, the groups that are more likely to be going to restaurants, which seem to be doing fairly well right now. How do you sort of offset that with Kroger’s prepared food offerings and maybe what changes are you making in those categories?
Rodney McMullen: Well, first of all, we believe that that’s a huge opportunity. Our market share -- half of meals bought at a restaurant is consumed in a car or at home. Actually, I think it’s a little over half. So we see that as a huge opportunity. I would say we’re trying a lot of different things. We have -- we’re working with a couple of outside companies trying to help us there. But to me it’s more of -- in the future we have a bigger opportunity than we’ve been able to unlock so far and we believe it’s a huge opportunity because what we’ve found is that a customer can buy a meal from us and it’s usually the cost is one-third to one-fourth versus going out to a restaurant. So it’s -- for us, it’s a great opportunity, but we’re just scratching the surface.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions. So I’ll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you for all the questions. And as always, we have a lot of our associates listening in. First, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to those impacted by the recent hurricanes. I would also like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation for our dedicated team of associates, especially during this time. They just did amazing things on supporting communities. And as you know, our stores are vital to each community we serve and during these types of times, our customers rely on us to provide them with food and other essential items. And I am so proud of our associates who have stepped up to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for everything that you do for Kroger and our customers. And thank you for everyone joining us today. We wish you a very happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Operator: Thank you all for joining today’s call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-09-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our second quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the second quarter, and finally, I will close with an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning to our performance this quarter, we continue to execute our strategy and we are delivering solid financial results through the strength and diversity of our model. We are driving positive customer activity with a compelling combination of affordable prices and personalized promotions on great quality products, all through a unique seamless experience. Our strong customer trends also reflect our enhanced focus on elevating the customer experience through excellent store execution, which continued into the second quarter. Customers continue adjusting to the current economic environment. The reduction of excess savings built up during the pandemic, higher interest rates and the effect of inflation are pressuring customers' ability to spend. This is especially true for our most budget-conscious customers, as we've been seeing for a while now, but we're now seeing other customer segments beginning to make changes as well. Customers are purchasing lower-priced cuts of meat, buying less and focusing on essentials. Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essential items and groceries. And then as the month progresses, they are more cautious with their spending. In response, we are supporting our customers by keeping prices low through promotions, including loyalty discounts, personalized offers and fuel rewards. We are also expanding our multi-tiered portfolio of Our Brands products, which provides customers exceptional alternatives to national brands competing on quality, while at a noticeable lower price point. Our long term model demonstrates that by consistently keeping prices low, we increase customer loyalty and grow share of wallet. While the food-at-home industry remains competitive, our model drives efficiencies that allow us to sustainably invest in value and maintain competitive price spreads with key competitors. In addition to lowering prices, we executed our go-to-market strategy through our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. We are proud of our associates for bringing this strategy to life with another quarter of excellent store execution. This led to another quarter of strong customer trends, including total and loyal household growth and an increase in customer visits. Mainstream households, our largest customer segment, led our sales growth through more households and increased visits. By delivering a more consistent customer experience, we are moving customers up the loyalty ladder and positioning ourselves for long term sales growth. I'd now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy, starting by leading with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise reflects our commitment that customers can trust the quality and freshness of every item they purchase. This promise is only possible through our strong relationships with farmers and suppliers, which enables Kroger to source the freshest products. Field & Vine, one of the newest Our Brands lines, offers regionally grown berries picked at peak freshness. We are very pleased with the initial customer response to this line. Our Brands is an important differentiator for our business, enabling us to offer innovative products at a great value. This combination of quality and value led to Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brand sales growth this quarter. More than 90% of our customer households purchased Our Brands products during that time. Across the portfolio of Our Brands, we are expanding into new categories and launching new products with almost 600 already introduced this year. Each of these new products is thoroughly tested and validated to earn its spot on our shelves, competing aggressively with national brands with no compromise on quality. Smart Way, one of our opening price point brands, is delivering exceptional value to customers on a budget. These are ultra low-priced essentials and pantry staples that we know our customers need the most. We continued expanding the Smart Way lineup in the second quarter to meet our customer needs for more value. We are also making progress on Our Brands refreshment roll out, with more of Our Brands portfolio to be refreshed later this year. We are excited to see our customers respond to these new designs. As we innovate within the portfolio and expand to meet customer needs, we are improving our mix and driving better profitability. For example, our manufacturing plants allow us to make many of our own products, keeping costs lower as we pass those savings on to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins. Next is an update on personalization. Our loyalty program and personalized promotions enabled us to deliver value beyond the shelf price. We collect data and insights, which enable us to enhance our personalization capabilities, delivering better product recommendations and more effective promotions. As a result, we are generating greater unit lift on promotions compared to the industry. Boost, our paid membership program supports our personalization capabilities. This quarter, we held a Boost Bonus Days event, which provided Boost customers even more savings during the two week special event. This event went well above and beyond the incredible value the membership already offers with daily savings, free delivery on orders of $35 or more and two times fuel points. Now turning to seamless. Digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. One of the many ways we move customers up the loyalty ladder is to convert digitally-engaged households into e-commerce households. This means we are moving customers from simply using our app or website to making purchases through one of these digital channels. This work resulted in our teams growing e-commerce households 14% this quarter. Households who shop with us digitally and in our stores are important because they are our most loyal and increase retail media and monetization opportunities. Delivery solutions led our sales growth once again this quarter, with pickup also showing very strong demand. Demand across our Kroger delivery network, which provides customers a premium shopping experience, continues to grow. Customers tell us they love the convenience of on-time and refrigerated delivery right to their homes. Profitability remains a key focus as we drive volume growth through our Customer Fulfillment Centers. Our teams are working hard to improve the shape of weekly and daily demand as well as refining trade areas to improve customer delivery density. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty and creating more growth opportunities. First, with alternative profit businesses, which had a strong quarter, led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, their results were in line with internal expectations and keep us on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year. Next is health and wellness, we continue to be optimistic about this area of our business. We know that grocery customers, who are also pharmacy customers, are more loyal to Kroger, and spend more with us. While the pharmacy industry is going through a period of transformation and disruption, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers live healthier lives and grow share. Over the long term, we remain confident and our teams are working hard to navigate industry challenges and position the company for future growth. During the quarter, sales outpaced internal expectations. Profitability was similar to last year, but behind internal expectations due to product mix pressures, specifically as a result of strong GLP-1 sales. We expect GLP-1s to have a similar impact on our results for the remainder of the year. Our vaccine efforts are ramping up now and should help offset some of the GLP-1 impact in the second half of the year. Turning to associates, our full fresh and friendly commitment is our roadmap to achieving a best-in-class customer experience, and we appreciate our associates for delivering again this quarter. We are facilitating this improved customer experience through our commitment to be an employer of choice. We are achieving this by investing in associate wages and by continuing to create an outstanding supportive work environment. It is great to see these efforts recognized with a perfect score on the 2024 Disability Inclusion Equality Index, making Kroger a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'll now turn it over to Todd to take you through our second quarter financial results. Todd?
Todd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results reflect the resilience of our model as investments made to diversify our business are enabling us to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. Our results through the first half of the year are in line with our expectations, and with our improving sales momentum, we are able to reaffirm our full year guidance. I'll now take you through our second quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 1.2%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales were supported by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We are encouraged by favorable unit trends as we continue to make progress toward achieving positive unit growth. As we saw in the first quarter, vendor support for promotions has been strong, and we will continue to deliver on our long term commitment of providing customers with exceptional value. Digital sales had a strong quarter, led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Pickup is an important part of our seamless ecosystem and demand continues to be strong, with pickup sales growing 10%. This reflects our digital team's relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience, resulting in increased fill rates, a reduction in wait times and a 33% improvement in perfect orders, which are orders with both a 100% fill rate and that are completed within an appropriate wait time. With the help of AI-enabled advancements and dynamic batching and routing, we are able to offer two hour lead times and pickup in all stores. These improvements in customer experience are being accompanied by productivity enhancements, resulting in an improvement in our cost to serve. Turning to margins, I would like to spend a little more time today talking about our second quarter trends in gross margin and OG&A rates. As you know, our long term model is designed to deliver consistent year-over-year gross margin rate and OG&A rates in a way that we deliver slightly expanding operating margins over time. Though there can be puts and takes in these measures from quarter-to-quarter, over the long term, our business model gives us the flexibility to balance investments in lower prices and higher associate wages with growth in margins through Our Brands and alternative profit businesses as well as cost-saving initiatives and productivity, all to ensure that we are consistently returning value to shareholders. This expectation is true for fiscal 2024 as well. For the full year, we now expect FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, to be slightly positive, balanced by the OG&A rate without fuel, which will be slightly negative. This quarter, FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was 42 basis points favorable to last year and was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Conversely, the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was 65 basis points unfavorable to last year as well as unfavorable to our expectations, primarily due to several nonrecurring charges during the quarter. Looking in more detail at our quarterly results, gross margin was 22.6% of sales. The increase in FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was primarily attributable to favorable product mix in our grocery business, including Our Brands, lower shrink and sourcing benefits, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The improvement in shrink reflects the significant ongoing work from our operations team as they address this challenging issue. While we are pleased with the result this quarter, shrink related to theft remains high on a historical basis, and we still have work to do to further mitigate the financial impact. The increase in OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was driven by investments in associate wages, increased incentive plan costs and nonrecurring costs, including hurricane expenses and an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims, partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. During the second quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $21 million, compared to a charge of $4 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $984 million. Our adjusted EPS was $0.93 per diluted share, a decline of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our total value proposition. It builds loyalty through our Kroger Plus program by offering customers another way to save and led to gallon sales outpacing the industry this quarter. Fuel profitability was stronger in the second quarter compared to last year on a cents per gallon basis. In the second half, we will be cycling stronger fuel results, but expect margins to be relatively flat compared to last year. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, a topic I am asked about frequently. Inflation increased slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter, but is trending around 1%, which is consistent with our expectations since the start of the year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California, Columbus Valley stores, Mid-Atlantic Division stores, Anderson Bakery, Michigan, West Michigan and New Market clerks, Central Peoria clerks and Shelbyville warehouse, covering more than 13,000 associates. Kroger is working to reach an agreement with the UFCW for meat and grocery associates at 29 Fred Meyer stores in Portland. We respect our associates' right to collectively bargain. Associates at these stores chose to strike for six days before returning to work last week. Negotiations continue this week, and we remain open to constructive dialogue with the UFCW. We are also communicating to local unions. They are coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates, with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. It underlines our goal of growing the company in a way that helps to ensure job security and create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Consistent generation of free cash flow is an important part of our model and is enabling us to deleverage in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.24, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for shareholders. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. The strength of our free cash flow gives us the ability to invest in the growth of our business. We are allocating more capital to our major and minor store projects this year. Our teams have done an excellent job completing projects ahead of schedule. And year-to-date, we have completed almost double the amount of store projects as we had completed last year at this time, which will position us to grow in the second half of 2024 and 2025. It also creates capacity later this year to work towards opening 2025 projects earlier in the year as well. To reflect this, we are raising our guidance for full year capital expenditures from a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on the strength of our free cash flow, the change to our CapEx guidance does not affect our adjusted free cash flow guidance. In the second quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow. Our quarterly dividend has grown at a 13.5% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006, and this marked the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are encouraged by our performance through the first half of the year, which led to results that were in line with expectations. Our solid sales results through the first two quarters of the year give us confidence to raise the low end of our full year identical sales without fuel guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.75% to 1.75%. We are cautiously optimistic about our sales outlook for the second half of the year and expect customers to continue prioritizing food and essentials. We have developed merchandising plans that are designed to enhance customer engagement, drive spending and improve unit volumes. The strength of our model enables us to navigate an environment where customer spending is constrained by current economic pressures, and we expect the various components of our model, including grocery, health and wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses to provide us with flexibility in how we create shareholder value. As a result, we are reaffirming the rest of our full year guidance. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey, and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business, while also preparing for the merger. Integration work continues to progress, and our teams are laser-focused on ensuring a seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers an even better experience. As part of our merger preparation, Kroger recently launched an exchange offering for Albertsons notes, contingent upon the closing of the merger as well as a successful new offering for $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes with the net proceeds expected to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger. A portion of the proceeds of this offering is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the merger does not close. As the preliminary injunction trial with the FTC nears its conclusion, we are confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive, and we know how our customers shop. Every day, they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. As I have said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever, and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. We are delivering strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in our business and drive attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Edward Kelly: There's been increased concern around the competitive backdrop, rising promotions across the industry. Can you just talk about what you are seeing from a promotional and competitive standpoint? And then what are your plans as you think about the back half of the year? I mean you did raise the gross margin guidance a bit today. So it certainly seems like you believe you can manage it. But just thoughts around what's going on out there and your promotional plans.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look, I would say the promotions are getting back to pretty much normal. And obviously, during COVID there was less promotions because supply chains were under tremendous pressure. The other thing that we would say on the promotions we are doing, we view -- the ones that we're doing are more effective and the CPG partners are increasing their support for some of those as well as they're trying to grow tonnage. If you look at -- as Todd outlined, overall, we feel good about the balance of the year and balancing cost reductions and mix changes that are helping gross and our continued investment in pricing, which we've been doing for, I think, close to 20 years now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on gross margin. It was really quite strong, and you called out some of the factors there. But can you help us just understand how digital is impacting gross margin? Is that included in your kind of mix category? And just a general update on digital profitability as you look forward really into the back half and the next couple of years here?
Todd Foley: Yes. Be glad to, Kelly. Yes, you're right. As we went into the year, we talked about the expectations for our margins to be relatively flat. And included in that expectation was a little bit of an increase in the second quarter year-over-year. But even on top of that, some of the strength that we saw in Our Brands, like we called out, we had a tremendous quarter in Our Brands, actually, the sales growth there outpaced national brands quite meaningfully that helped drive it above our expectations. And also, we had a great shrink quarter. It's been a while since we've looked year-over-year on shrink and seen positive results. So that's really exciting to see as we called out. Still a lot of work to do there on a go-forward basis. So it was a little bit better than our expectations, which were to be up some, and therefore, for the balance of the year, we do expect for the full year margins to now be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis. So from a digital profitability standpoint, Rodney, if you want to add anything in that space?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, I'll just a couple of comments. We continue to make progress. If you look at over the next two or three years, we see the opportunity to make significant progress, and we would hold ourselves accountable for doing that. The thing that's pretty special about the overall ecosystem that we're building, is when you look at a customer that engages with us seamless, they actually still physically go into stores. Sometimes they do delivery, sometimes they do pick up. They also become more loyal in other aspects, becoming Boost members, engaging in pharmacy. So as you look out over the next two or three years, we are very excited about the potential of that and the continued progress. Obviously, the media business helps gross margin and the margins in that is significantly different than anything that we've ever sold in the supermarket store. Thanks Kelly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Anders Myhre: Good morning. This is Anders Myhre on for John. Between the proactive cost reductions, the media growth and the moderating digital losses, should we expect a greater amount of P&L benefits than there have been in recent years? And if so, how much of this incremental benefit flows through to the bottom line versus reinvestment into other areas of the business? Thank you.
Todd Foley: Yeah. Great question. The things that you call out are great examples of some of the margin enhancement programs that we've talked about in the past as well as some of the productivity improvements and cost improvements that we've realized over time. That's an important part of our overall business model, being able to use that value that we create through the things that you called out to invest it back in the business. Rodney alluded to it. We have a long history of taking that value and reinvesting it back in the business in a way that over time, our operating profit rate grows slightly over time. So as we grow the top line, as we're able to balance the investments with the benefits that we get from those that drives the bottom line over time.
Rodney McMullen: Yes, I think it's always a good reminder that our long term TSR model is 8% to 11% a year. That long term TSR model assumes that we continue to move and grow alternative profit businesses, continue to invest in wages, continue to invest in lower prices for our customers. As you know fortunately, we generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow. We would expect over time for more of that growth to come from the business as opposed to buying back stock. And then once the merger happens, obviously, there's incremental accretion that will happen because of the merger for a period of time that once the merger happens, we'll give more insights into. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Leah Jordan: Good morning. Thank your for taking my question. Thinking if you could comment on your market share trends in the quarter, and especially interested in any color on what you're seeing in Fresh specifically as I know that's been a big area of investment for you?
Rodney McMullen: Yes. If you look at our Fresh trends overall, they would be stronger than the center store. Overall, I would say that we feel okay about where we are. But if you look, going forward, we continue to see improvement, and we would expect to see improvement throughout the balance of the year. So it's one of those areas where we're not satisfied. We are gaining strong household growth and strong loyal household growth as well, which also, in the past, always leads to future progress as well. So I would say that we feel okay where we are. We're more excited about what we see where the trends are and where we see for the balance of the year and next year because we're also incrementally adding storing [ph] as well, which helps on market share as well. Thanks Leah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Simeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. Two-parter. First, if you look at the second quarter and the second half, the difference in comp that you're guiding to, how is it changing between units and inflation? I heard the inflation piece, but curious how the guidance reflects this. It looks like it's slightly better than consensus. The second part is, if this environment stays, and I know you're not -- you're trying to improve share and grow comps. But if we stay in this very low single-digit environment, do you spend the same way in the business next year, and you think you can keep the core EBIT dollars roughly flat or margin flat in this backdrop? Thank you.
Todd Foley: Yes. Good question, Simeon. Let me start with the differences in comp. We did update our sales guidance for the year, taking up the bottom end of that range, as you saw from 25 basis points to 75 basis points, but kept the top end of the range at 1.75 basis points. And I think our thought process around that was really to take the low end off the table. If you think about where we came into the year, and there was quite a bit of disinflation last year. That was still kind of hitting us early in the year and wanted to make sure that we were navigating through that uncertainty. Our view at the time was that Q1 would be the low point of the year, and we would consistently grow our sales as we went through the year on a backdrop of inflation that was 1%-ish as we go throughout the year. And that's really -- certainly through the first half, it's played out as we expected in the first half of the year. And our expectations for the back half are very similar to the way that we thought about it back then. So I would say both our expectations on the sales and the inflation environment backdrop against which, it hasn't really changed a whole lot, and we expect that growth to flow. From a unit standpoint, we've talked about that a little bit. Rodney alluded to the fact we continue to be encouraged by the trends there. We're still a little negative on the unit side, but we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making in that space and think that will be part of the contribution to the sales trend that we see for the back half of the year.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, we are seeing progress on units. We would expect to continue to see progress on units. You didn't really ask, but if -- the thing that's right now, what we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, in the first of the month, our business is really strong, holidays are strong. And then when you get to the end of the month, they're weaker because of the people being constrained on a budget. So far in the third quarter, we're tracking a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. So fundamentally, we believe all the programs we're doing is making improved connection. Your question relative to 2025, I would say it's still early for us to start sharing guidance on 2025, and I would just -- the comments I made earlier about our long term business model really would apply to 2025. Obviously, we would expect to be in a position of where we've just completed a merger, and we would also need to update where we are relative to the merger and the integration of the merger and those factors as well. So thanks, Simeon, for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Montani: Great. Thank you for taking the question. It seems that the guide is implying a stable or even slightly up EBIT margin in the back half of the year. And I just wanted to understand a little bit if you could parse out the drivers behind that, in particular, with relation to shrink, if there's favorable compares coming up that give you confidence, and/or if there's certain onetime costs that you could quantify for us on OG&A that wouldn't come up again?
Todd Foley: Yeah. We'll do, Michael. You're right. Great call out. And as we look at the back half of the year, we talked about, given the trends that we saw in the second quarter, our view for the year on gross margin would be that it will be slightly favorable year-over-year. And on OG&A, the annual trend will be slightly unfavorable year-over-year. But we do expect those to reasonably balance as they come out. We talked a little bit about shrink earlier. And again, we're really excited about the results that we saw in shrink, but I mentioned the caution that we have there. There is a lot of work to do. That issue is still out there. And our shrink costs are high relative to history on where we've been this. So our team continues to work in that space and continues to drive it. You can't have a trend until you have a data point. And so we're excited to see where we're at, but we're kind of cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for shrink for the balance of the year. Relative to some of the other costs--
Rodney McMullen: Before you move on, one additional shrink, Michael, that you might -- that everyone might find helpful is if you look at our Fresh side of our business, we've made meaningful progress on improving shrink over several quarters. Now when you look at the center store with organized retail crime and other things, you couldn't see it. But there's been tremendous changes by using technology, AI processes, and our teams have done a nice job of improving the Fresh side on shrink. That's not subject to as much theft, but it's really process-oriented. So now, Todd, I'll let you go and talk about some of the other stuff.
Todd Foley: Yes. Great color, I appreciate that. Talking a little bit on the cost side, there are -- we did see in the second quarter in part of why it was a little bit worse than our expectations, some non-recurring type of items. The main one was some costs related to Hurricane Beryl that came through. Obviously, that was event-driven relative to that. The second, and we've talked a little bit about this, we've talked about incentive being a little bit higher than our expectations. We do think for the second half of the year that will have less of an impact on our year-over-year OG&A than what we've seen in the past as well. So I think those are a couple of the examples of things that we don't expect to continue in the second half.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi, thank you and good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper into inflation, just in light of the CPI and PPI numbers that came out this morning. Usually the two rates have changed. They're not perfectly correlated, but they're somewhat correlated. And right now, PPI food is increasing at a faster clip than CPI. So I just wanted to get a sense for how you think about balancing the need to pass on inflation? I know that PPI is not a perfect proxy for that, but it's somewhat of a proxy. Balance that with the desire to continue to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, and then how do we reconcile all of that with the fact that your GM growth was so good when PPI is growing so much faster than CPI?
Rodney McMullen: Yes. As you've mentioned, I mean, you're always trying to balance all the pieces. Part of the PPI is it's -- certain parts of it are commodity-driven. And we will -- if we think something is a permanent cost increase then we try to pass that along as fast as we can. If it's a short-term blip, then we'll manage that based on what's going on in the market. And it's as difficult now estimating where inflation is going to be as probably any period of time, but we are seeing it being reasonably stable. If you look out in terms of price increases that CPGs have already shared with us because obviously, we'll see that in advance of it happening, it would certainly still be in the range of where we said we think overall inflation will be around 1%. And we don't see anything that's causing us to see that be much different than that. Over time, we do find the two kind of line up pretty close. The other thing that we are seeing is inflation on food away from home is meaningfully higher than food at home. And we are beginning to see customers move back from restaurants to food at home because you can prepare a meal at home for about a fourth of the cost of going out and getting a meal. So that is something that we are beginning to see a little bit of as well. I don't know, Todd, anything else you want to add on inflation?
Todd Foley: I don't. Thanks, Rodney.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first on CapEx, so higher range for this year. So I just want to get a sense of if we should think about this level of spend as more of a normal going forward. And then secondly, not sure if you're giving any clarity in terms of how to think about the EPS growth cadence between Q3 and Q4 as I know you're lapping the 53rd week later this year.
Todd Foley: Yes. Great color, Rupesh. On the CapEx, yes I think we talked about it. We've been working really hard to take the opportunity to get these storing projects open as quickly as we can to be able to serve customers. And so shifting spend from late in '24 to early in '24. You saw our CapEx year-to-date be a little bit higher. That's going to create some capacity to help us pull early -- what might have been early '25 construction process into late '24, so we can open next year's projects early too. So I think given the strong cash flow in the business, if we're able to continue to execute that, then I think what we'll see should be a lift in our spend in our capital plan over time.
Rodney McMullen: And we're -- the money that we're investing, we're seeing good performance to budget as well. And operationally, it's a lot easier to open up a remodel or new store expansion earlier in the year versus later in the year as well.
Todd Foley: And then talking to your EPS comment, Rupesh, yes, for the balance of -- given where we landed in the first quarter in our actual results -- for the first half of the year, sorry, our first half kind of landed where we expected it to, quarter's played out a little bit differently than we thought. But the first half landed where we expected. And reaffirming the rest of the year, the back half, we think is right on par with where we've been guiding as well. Within that, we do think that the third quarter will be probably slightly ahead of where we were year-over-year and the fourth quarter probably slightly behind on a 52-week basis when you compare it 52 to 52, but that's probably how the trend will play out for the balance of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark Carden: Good morning. It's Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser this morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So you talked about some of the trade down that's accelerated in 2Q to additional income cohorts, and also highlight some of the pressures that budget customers are facing. What kinds of behavior changes are you seeing in your middle income and above cohorts? And when did you see this become more pronounced?
Rodney McMullen: Yes. It's throughout the year, and as I mentioned before, we're seeing it more at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. And people continue to be aggressive or whatever the right term is on celebrating holidays. Now I think one of the things that's always important to remember is those changes aren't -- many of those changes are beneficial to us. So if you think about people moving from eating at a restaurant to cooking at home, that's beneficial for us. If we look at customers' changing segments, that's good for us because they typically will buy more Our Brands, products and they'll buy smaller packages and some of those things as well. So when we look, it's been really throughout. But I would say, over the last few months, it's been more pronounced as you get toward the end of the month. But all of those things are things that -- obviously, you're changing your promotional approach, your connection with the customers, what offers you make at different times of the month and all those things. So overall, the customer, as we've said all along, are under tremendous strain, especially customers on a budget. That was the reason why I want to say it was probably 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago, we saw that coming, and we introduced our Smart Way product to be much more aggressive on having an entry price point item because that was a trend that we saw coming and trying to be proactive on addressing that, and we continue to add product in that. But for us, we're going to do everything we can to help a customer be able to have a great meal without compromising and eating as a family. And so far, the changes the customer is experiencing, we're making changes to trying to support the customer and the customer is connecting well with that. So you feel for people in terms of where they are, and we're going to do everything we can to try to help support them on what their particular situation is.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Robert Ohmes: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Todd, for you, can we get even -- you gave some color already on the OG&A line for the back half. Maybe a little more how -- where is Kroger on the wage pressure in the back half of the year, say versus the front half? And also, you guys called out general liability claims. You're not the only retailer to call that out this quarter. If we get some -- how much pressure was that in the second quarter and is that an issue or a pressure in the back half? Thanks.
Todd Foley: Yes. No, great call out. Relative to second half OG&A again, given what we saw in the second quarter, our guidance on the year is now we will be slightly unfavorable to where we were a year ago. But beyond that, I think our trends will be as expected in the second half of the year. You talk about wage pressure. One thing to keep in mind on our wage pressure is because so many of our wages come through collective bargaining agreements, we've got 300 or so of those. But at any point in time, probably 75% of our wages are locked in, in a collective bargaining agreement. We have maybe a third or a quarter of those that are up each year that we constantly negotiate. So the guidance that we have out there reflects those expectations and where we're at from a wage perspective because most of those are known to us going into the year. Your comment on GL claims, there's really two pieces to general liability. The incident rate piece is -- actually our results are phenomenal. When you look at it through the lens of OSHA incident rates, we're very much below where the industry averages are at. And even as a company where we're at, we're in that kind of record low territory there, at least in modern history. And so we're extremely excited about the work that the teams do to manage the incidents from that standpoint and the number of claims. What we saw as we were going through our analysis this time was around the average cost of the claim, and what we were seeing relative to the cost to settle some of these claims being much higher. Given the environment that's out there, we're seeing more and more pressure on the average cost to settle those claims. And so as we evaluated what we had outstanding for reserves in that space, given that trend, we thought it was wise to update it. We have done a nice job in the past trying to mitigating those claims and have a variety of strategies to put into place, and we'll continue to be able to put more of those types of items in place to be more effective in keeping that average cost down. But I think the announces that we did, I think, has us comfortable with where we need to be now and we don't expect that to recur in the back half of the year.
Rodney McMullen: One other comment I would add to -- Robbie, to the OG&A comment that Todd was talking about is, we feel like we've developed a good skill on being able to identify cost reductions over time. And we would expect that's a skill that we'll have also as you look out in the second half and forward in next year as well. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on is continuing to find process changes to be able to operate a store with less labor and simplify the store to run. And it's one of those where we've made good progress, but we still think we have plenty of opportunity to get better going forward. So I really appreciate the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky: Rodney, when you look at the sales growth challenges, you mentioned the economic factors putting pressure on consumers, and it seems to be a wide range of consumers. But you also have nontraditional competitors put pressure on the supermarket channel. Can you sort of compare what the strengths of those difficult headwinds are as you're trying to accelerate sales at Kroger?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, the increase in non-traditional competitors, obviously, has been a 20-year trend. And when you look at Amazon and Costco and Walmart and I could go on and on for the litany, those in terms of how do you be successful against them really is how do you continue to change your basic offering to the customer and supporting the customers' changes. And we felt good about those changes that we've made, but we still need to continue to make them. And it's one of those things where, if you ever think you've figured it out, it's -- I would say that it's not good, you need to change. So we feel good about our ability to compete. We'll have to continually change. It's the reason why we've invested so much in staying connected with the customer on a seamless perspective, continuing to invest in wages, continuing to invest in promotion, but making up some of those things with alternative profit growth and mix. And over time, we would hope food away -- a more stronger competitor on food away from home because half of the money that's spent on food is food away from home. And we see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get a share of that. If you look at the economic pressure so far, we feel confident in our ability to deal with it or manage it or whatever because there's -- fortunately, we have a large business, and there's a lot of moving parts. And Our Brands obviously had a strong quarter. We think the opportunity is even stronger in Our Brands and things like that, which helps support the customer that's under that economic pressure as well. So on those so far, I mean, if you had a depression, I wouldn't -- I would give a different answer. But so far on the things that we're seeing, we feel comfortable or confident in our ability to deal with those changes. Thanks Chuck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Joe Feldman: I wanted to ask about inventory level, which was down a little bit and down, I think, almost 3%, which is really good shape. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about inventory going forward? And what drove that? Was it you guys -- is it fewer units? Is it because the prices have just come down a bit year-over-year, so you've been able to be lower inventory levels because of that? Maybe you could just share a little more color around that going forward.
Todd Foley: Yes. Great question, Joe. And I think you hit on some of the keys. I think it's a variety of things. Inventory, it's -- part of it is we're seeing less cost inflation, so the average cost of an item on the shelf is a little bit less. But we have also been very laser-focused relative to working capital and working capital management. When we talk about our strong cash flow generation, that's an important part of that is balancing our working capital. And it's -- both of those go together. It's always having the right tension between making sure we're in stock for our customers and having what our customers need, but making sure we don't have too much there so that we're being a good steward of working capital. So I think what you're seeing on the balance sheet is the combination of lower cost per item, relative inflation year-over-year and the right level of working capital management to make sure we're in stock for our customers.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions for today, so I'll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Alex and thank you to all for all your questions. And as you know, before we conclude our call, we always like to -- we have many of our associates listening in, and we always like to share a couple of comments with them. And I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our 2024 Kroger Scholars. Since the Kroger Scholars Program was launched in 2008, we've awarded more than 3,300 scholarships, totaling almost $5 million to children of our associates. These recipients were selected based on a broad range of criteria, including their volunteering activities, civic service, extracurricular activities, academic performance and work experience. And it's always fun to be able to help a little on their education and congratulations to our 120 winners this year. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I know it's early, but it will be December before we talk to everyone. I hope everyone has a beginning, great holiday season as well, and thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-06-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carla and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead.
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's first quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our first quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the first quarter. Finally, I will provide a few comments on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions. We're off to a solid start in 2024, reflecting the strength and diversity of our model. As better than expected performance from our Grocery business helped us manage Fuel and Health & Wellness results that were behind expectations, Kroger is providing exceptional value and a unique omnichannel experience, which combined with strong store execution, led to growth in households and an increase in customer visits. As inflation moderates, we expect customer sentiment to continue improving. But near term, many customers are managing economic uncertainty. While we expect Health & Wellness profitability pressures to continue into the second quarter, our recent improvement on store execution metrics and strong customer trends give us confidence that we are building momentum for a strong back half of the year and we are well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. As we've seen over recent quarters, customers continue to seek value and are shopping with us differently based on their financial situations. Spending from premium and mainstream customers continue to be strong. Mainstream households drove our overall household growth and we improved our share of wallet with premium customers who are deepening their loyalty, spending more in our fresh departments and enjoying more premium products such as Private Selection. Within our most budget-conscious households, we are starting to see positive momentum and we grew households in this segment after experiencing declines last year. Historic multi-year inflation across the economy, high interest rates and reduced government benefits disproportionately affect these customers and are influencing their spending behaviors. Kroger's longstanding commitment to low prices and personalized promotions creates real value for our customers at a time when many of them need it more than ever. Food-at-home continues to be the most affordable meal option for customers while food inflation has impacted every meal occasion, inflation in food-away-from-home has been even higher than food-at-home inflation since 2019. We are committed to making sure our customers can enjoy a great meal experience with zero compromise on quality, selection, value and convenience. We see a significant growth opportunity to deliver convenient restaurant quality meals at an attractive value and we are expanding our Ready To Heat and Ready To Eat offerings. For example, after we revamped our fried chicken recipe, we created a meal bundle which feeds a family for $3.50 a person, a fraction of what it would cost to eat out at restaurants with quality that's difficult to beat. Every day we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience and we are focused on sharpening our store execution to do just that. This year, we raised the bar on our full, fresh and friendly customer experience metrics and we are very proud of our store teams who are delivering an even better shopping experience with service metrics at record highs. To continue the momentum in our Grocery business, we are committed to keeping prices low for customers and delivering a consistent experience while growing our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, Seamless and Personalization. Leading with Fresh, our store team's primary goal this year is to drive more consistent shopping experience and that begins with Fresh. We are introducing new technology that's enabling our teams to better track [Technical Difficulty]
Operator: We have lost connection with today's speaker. Please stand by while we still try to reconnect with them. Thank you for your patience, everyone. We now have the speaker back on the line. Please continue.
Rodney McMullen: Our ongoing work to differentiate and elevate our brands is driving higher profitability. We are identifying new supply sources using more effective promotions and improving product mix, which is contributing to further margin improvements. Now to Seamless. Delivery solutions led digital results again this quarter with an increase in both households and visits. Pickup also had solid growth and focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment led to strong improvements in key customer experience metrics. This quarter, our teams improved fill rates to a new record high, reduced wait time and delivered a significant improvement in perfect orders compared to last year. Through the power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways to elevate the Pickup experience for customers and at the same time reduce costs. With dynamic batching of orders, these tools are providing associates the most effective pick routes, which is enabling us to dramatically reduce pick lead time in our highest volume stores. Our customers love the Kroger delivery experience with refrigerated products delivered directly to their doorstep. As a result, the Kroger delivery network has experienced remarkable growth with sales nearly doubling this quarter versus last year. As we focus on providing an incredible customer experience, we are learning and adjusting the delivery network. A good example of this is our decision in the first quarter to close three spoke locations to reallocate capacity closer to our automated fulfillment centers where we have higher customer density and better order level profitability. This decision does not impact Kroger's automated FCs or other spoke locations. We remain confident that our Kroger delivery network provides a differentiated customer experience and will continue to be a key pillar of our digital growth strategy. Turning to Personalization. The combination of seamless and our personalization capabilities generated another quarter of digital engagement growth, up 9% compared to the same quarter last year. Personalization enables us to balance the depth and breadth of our promotions more effectively and encourages customers to engage more with us by focusing on promotions that matter most to them. This led to an 18% increase in digital coupon clips compared to last year. Capturing more digital households is a key to our long-term growth model as these households are more loyal, spend nearly three times as much with us and drive our alternative profit businesses. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we create momentum in our Grocery business. In turn, this creates the data and traffic to accelerate growth in areas like Health & Wellness and our Alternative Profit businesses. Alternative Profit businesses had a strong quarter led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing. KPM results were in-line with what we expected and keep us on track to meet our full-year expectations of more than 20% media growth. Yesterday, KPM continued to broaden its reach by offering its custom audiences and ad measurement capabilities to advertisers on the Meta social media platforms. This is another important step in KPM's growth, creating more opportunities for clients to reach relevant audiences in more places and providing better transparency to add effectiveness. Health & Wellness grew its top line this quarter. However, profitability results were below expectations. We are optimistic about the potential of this area of our business. Our script adherence initiatives are on track and our teams are providing excellent care which helps patients live healthier lives. Additionally, our marketing plans and in-store activations designed to raise awareness and attract new patients are launching now to help drive growth in the back half of the year. Turning now to associates. Our associates are doing an excellent job elevating the customer experience and improving our full, fresh and friendly metrics this quarter. Team consistency leads to better execution and retention improved again this quarter. We are retaining more associates through a holistic approach which includes wage and benefit investments and also a focus on associates well-being and this work is being recognized. This quarter, Kroger received the 2024 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health. This is the third consecutive year that we've been recognized with the certification. And for the first time we received the top distinction. This program recognized Kroger as an employer who creates a mentally healthy workplace for our associates through culture, benefits, compliance and wellness programs. We'll continue to invest in our associates. When our associates have a better experience, they provide a better experience to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our first quarter financial results. Todd?
Todd Foley: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter performance reflects the resiliency of our model, which enables us to manage a variety of economic cycles. The strength of our model combined with the momentum in our Grocery business gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance even as we continue to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. I'll now take you through our first quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.5%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our identical sales were driven by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We continue to see sequential unit improvement and our teams remain focused on returning to positive units later this year. Inflation continues to moderate, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and towards the end of the first quarter, we began cycling the headwinds from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Digital sales grew by more than 8%, which was led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Gross margin was 22.4% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased seven basis points. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to lower pharmacy margins and increased price investments partially offset by favorable product mix reflecting Our Brands' margin performance. The slight decline in our FIFO gross margin rate was in line with our expectations. We expect our FIFO gross margin rate to improve beyond our first quarter result driven by the core components of our margin expansion initiatives. During the first quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $41 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same quarter last year. The decreased charge for the quarter was due to lower inflation expectations for the current year compared to last year. The OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items increased 22 basis points, driven by planned investments in associate wages and increased incentive plan costs partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect the factors identified in the first quarter to continue, leading to a similar to slightly higher OG&A rate. We expect our OG&A rate to improve in the second half of 2024. We continue to make progress on our digital profitability, delivering another quarter of improvement in our pickup cost to serve. It remains a long-term margin opportunity with runway to improve through increased volume and process enhancements. Our store associates played a key role in the cost to serve improvements and, as Rodney mentioned earlier, did so while they improved key customer experience metrics. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.499 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $1.43 per diluted share, a decline of $0.05 compared to last year. Fuel continues to be a key driver of our strategy to build loyalty by providing compelling fuel rewards to customers. We continue to see more reward activity with 8% more redemptions contributing to gallon sales, which outpaced the industry this quarter. However, our fuel profitability was below expectations this quarter with our cents per gallon fuel margin down low single-digits compared to last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy, resulting in an average hourly rate of $19 an hour and a rate of nearly $25, with comprehensive benefits factored in. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Houston Clerks and Meat, Mid-Atlantic Division stores in West Virginia, South Carolina stores in Columbia and Myrtle Beach and Portland Distribution Center and Drivers covering more than 21,000 associates. Turning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate adjusted free cash flow, strong adjusted free cash flow, through consistent operating results which is enabling us to continue deleveraging in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the quarter, Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.25 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides ample opportunities for Kroger to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on projects which drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth while remaining committed to our investment grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we shared last quarter our plans for approximately 30 major storing projects focused on higher growth geographies, where we have traditionally achieved a strong ROIC and operating profit growth. We've made good progress on our projects so far and remain on track with our plans. While early, we're happy with the results from projects completed in the first quarter. We are confident these new storing projects will help advance our omnichannel strategy and be an important component to our sales growth and TSR model going forward. During the first quarter, we announced we had entered an agreement for the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. As part of our regular and ongoing review of our portfolio, we determined that Specialty Pharmacy was not part of our core strategy going forward and a sale would enable us to focus on our Health & Wellness strategies that revolve around our retail pharmacies. Due to the sale, a non-recurring held for sale tax adjustment of $31 million was recognized in the quarter and it has been reflected as an adjustment item in our results. The sale of KSP is not expected to have an impact on our 2024 guidance. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our annual guidance reflecting both positive momentum we are seeing in our business along with a more cautious customer environment in the near term. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect a decline in adjusted EPS for the second quarter similar to the rate we observed in the first quarter as we expect pharmacy business profitability pressures to carry over into the second quarter. This reaffirms where we expected to be through both the first half of the year as well as the full fiscal 2024. In closing, our first quarter performance reflects the strength and resiliency of our model. We are strengthening our Grocery business, which drives the data and traffic to accelerate growth in our Alternative Profit businesses and we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd. As you've heard from both of us, our Grocery business is performing well and we are building momentum across our business. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategy, which is resonating with customers, and we have the financial strength to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. As we continue to prepare for our merger with Albertsons, I'd like to thank our associates for their incredible commitment. Since we announced the proposed merger back in October of 2022, our associates have done an exceptional job preparing for the integration with Albertsons while never once taking their eye off the ball of serving our customers, advancing our strategy, operating our business and driving results. Because of their efforts, we will be prepared to hit the ground running as a combined company ready to serve more customers from day one. A more general merger update, in April, we announced an expanded divestiture plan with C&S, which directly responds to the concerns raised by federal and state antitrust regulators regarding the original agreement. We believe the package, which includes a modified and expanded store set and more non-store assets, bolsters Kroger's position and regulatory challenges to the proposed merger. Including our upcoming court proceedings, it also positions C&S to be a strong and successful competitor. We are prepared to defend our merger because it will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country. Customers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. We have committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day one following close, along with an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. Employees will benefit from Kroger's commitment to invest $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits, further building on our $2.4 billion and incremental investments since 2018. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, this merger will secure union jobs. And communities will benefit from the strength and the ability of the combined company to accelerate Kroger's commitment to ending hunger. As a combined company, Kroger has committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the US by 2030. In closing, Kroger is off to a solid start to the year, positioning us well to deliver on our commitments. We continue to invest in associates and the associate experience because when they have a better experience, our customers do as well. Grocery results are off to a better-than-expected start, which provides the foundation for growth in Alternative Profit businesses and our model is generating strong free cash flow, which has strengthened our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. With that Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Rupesh Parikh: So I wanted to dig deeper into the gross margin line, if you can maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you guys see it for the balance of the year, including how you think about the pharmacy margins in the back half of the year.
Todd Foley: Yeah, thanks, Rupesh. Great question. We talked at the beginning of the year that our expectation was to have relatively flat year-over-year gross margin and that is still the expectation. As mentioned in my comments, we do expect results for the balance of the year to improve beyond our Q1 results and that's really reflective of some of the gross margin expansion efforts that we have going on. They're going actually really well. We alluded to our Our Brands performance. Our margins in Our Brands continue to do very well and as that business continues to grow, particularly in today's environment, we talked about the budget-conscious consumer and that continues to connect with them. And so the growth in that business helps drive the margins and we expect to see that as the year goes on. Fresh is another category where we've had meaningful growth. Fresh is doing really well. We've talked a lot about produce, our end-to-end Fresh and how that business is growing. And certainly that comes with higher margins, which has a positive effect on our mix. And then when you look at Alternative Profits and in particular retail media, that business continues to grow well and especially the second half of the year. We expect retail media to continue its momentum to achieve our growth of excess of 20% for the year. A lot going on in that space. And we went to a new platform a year ago and as we went and ramped up the platform a year ago, we'll be cycling that period of time with some of the momentum we have in that business. So all of those are where a lot of our confidence comes from when we talk about reaffirming our guidance for the year. And we alluded to some of the pharmacy headwinds. Even though we expect some of those to carry over into the second quarter, I think all of the results that we're seeing from our margin expansion efforts are going to continue to drive us so that we hit our expectations to improve the result relative to Q1.
Rodney McMullen: I want to just add a couple of points on Todd's last point. We continue to have good success with value-add product and typically that product is something that the customer can eat almost immediately in the car or at home, and that's helping on margin. And then our sourcing teams continue to have making progress in cost of goods, which helps as well.
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. In light of some of the competitor announcements of reducing price on certain items, just wondering how you guys feel about your price gaps today.
Rodney McMullen: If you look at overall, as you know, for the last, I don't know, 15, 18 years, part of the Kroger's strategy has always been to invest in pricing every year and 2024 wouldn't have been any different than any of the previous years. And we continue to execute against that plan of helping the customer stretch their budget. If you look at where we feel on our relative price position, we feel very good. And one of the things that we even -- was glad to see is if you look at the customer that's on a budget, for the first time in over a year, we actually had growth in count from that customer base. So overall, we feel good about where we are. One of the things I always think it's important to remember too is, as a promotional merchant, people buy a lot more when things are in promotion. We also have a very sophisticated rewards program for personalized offers that publicly you wouldn't see and also our fuel rewards. So overall, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about where we are relative to any of our competitors. Thanks, Rupesh.
Rupesh Parikh: Great, thank you. I'll pass it along.
Operator: The next question comes from Robert F. Ohmes from Bank of America Meryll Lynch.
Robert Ohmes: Oh, hey, Rodney. I had just two follow-ups on the first question. Hey, just in terms of the price investments, and I know you guys always do them, but has anything changed with what your CPG partners are doing with Kroger to drive volumes? Because we know that they're looking to do that. And then also would love to just get further perspective on what Kroger is seeing competitively either the same or different sort of there's kind of Walmart and Target, but what are the regionals and independents doing competitively? Are they changing at all? What they're doing?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at CPG partners, overall, we would be seeing more trade dollars than in the past, and I think some of that ties to the comment I made before on sourcing. As economists always say, all short statements are incorrect. There are some CPG partners that aren't worried as much about tonnage and wouldn't be as aggressive. But we are seeing an increased trend where CPG most CPG partners are starting to focus on tonnage again and then trying to partner with us more aggressively to help tonnage. If you look at regional competitors, really wouldn't see much difference there than the national competitors. And overall inflation is up slightly. You would see people raising slightly more prices than lowering. But nothing that's especially different there than what we would see. And as you know, there's a ton of great awesome regional competitors out there. Thanks, Robby.
Operator: The next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.
Uriel Zachary Abraham: Hi. This is Zach on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. First, with respect to the Q1 performance, would you say that you set up the guidance with some conservatism or was it genuinely stronger than what you thought it would look like? And maybe as a follow-up, why shouldn't we extrapolate that level of upside for the full year? And was it driven primarily by price or units or some of both? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look at the first quarter performance, as Todd and I both mentioned, we felt very good about where we were finished or where it turned out. One of the things I always think it's, the first quarter is so early in the year, I never felt -- it would be unusual for us to feel comfortable changing too much. If you look at things that we felt good about or the things that we outlined in the prepared comments around our customer count growth, the growth that's broad-based across all of our customer types, our store team is doing a very good job of continuing to improve the experience and in-stock positions and all those things. The couple of headwinds that we do have is if you look at like incentive plans, especially in the second quarter, we'll have significantly higher incentive plan accruals in the second quarter than what we did a year ago, which is partially what's affecting the second quarter. But overall, for the year, we feel good about where we are. We feel good about where we are relative to where we thought we would be. But it's really too early in the year to make too many changes.
Todd Foley: That's a good call, Rodney. And actually the two go together. The strength we saw in the first half of the business is really tied to your incentive plan comment. A big contributor to the strength we're seeing in our Grocery business is around our teams delivering on store execution and the shopping experience and improvement in those metrics is an important part of our incentive plan this year. So it's -- those two thoughts are connected with one another.
Uriel Zachary Abraham: Okay.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Zach.
Operator: The next question comes from Kenneth B. Goldman from JPMorgan.
Kenneth Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, are you still on track to see inflation increase as the year progresses? I think that was mentioned in the last quarter. I didn't hear any update on that rate of change. And then I don't think you provided, again, I may have missed it, gross profit dollars or pennies per gallon for fuel. Just trying to follow up on those two.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I'll let Todd answer the second part. On inflation for the year, the first quarter was pretty much where we expected it to be. Where we, for the year, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. So if I'm going off of memory, but I think we said it was slightly over 1% and we would continue to see it slightly over 1%. It's -- if you look at some of the commodity -- the commodities themselves, obviously that will bounce up and down. And as you get later in the year, we -- that some of that bounce will be driven by what kind of crop year is it relative to corn and some of those things. But really overall, what we expect inflation to be similar to where we did last year and it is starting to stabilize. We don't see deflation broad-based at all, but it is stabilizing around that little over 1%.
Todd Foley: Yeah, that's great. And on the fuel point, we did -- in my comments that we did see that cents per gallon margin was down low single digits.
Rodney McMullen: Okay. Thanks, Ken.
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.
John Heinbockel: Hey, Rodney, I wanted to start with, when you think about delivery and pickup profitability, I mean, I know you're losing money in those areas. Do you have an idea in mind when you can begin to approach breakeven? I know it's going to take a while, but thought on that. And then if you had to pick a couple of key drivers, right, that would get you there, what do you think they are?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, if you look, and John, we've talked about it a lot of times, I always say our job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer and job two is we have the responsibility to figure out how to be profitable with each of those customers. We do have some divisions that are now at breakeven or slightly profitable. And if you look at incrementally on a per order basis, through almost all of our channels, now they're -- incrementally they're contributing. In terms of our expectation of ourself is that, that customer will be just as profitable as a store customer over time. I don't know that I would put a specific date on it yet, but that is the expectations we have for ourselves. And the key things on it will be continuing, for me, I think number one is making sure our NPS scores stay strong because that's what causes that customer to continue to repeat. Then making sure that each basket we start getting where the customer adds items within a basket and then always from an operating cost standpoint, we'll continue to use our technology to be more efficient.
John Heinbockel: Okay. Then maybe as a follow-up on pharmacy. So what's your sense -- the pressure is coming from where? Is it solely reimbursement or something else? I mean what's your take on reimbursement longer term and are we basically going to see less capacity, right? Drugstores, right, are closing a lot of locations. But do you think between that, supermarkets getting out of the business, there will be a lot less capacity in Pharmacy three years or four years or five years from now that will help profitability?
Todd Foley: John, I'll talk to the headwinds a little bit. What we're seeing there was really a couple of items in product mix. One was around GLP-1. We've talked about that before. It's a high retail ring, but an extremely low margin and so that puts pressure on our margins. And coming into the year, if you recall the latter part of last year, we had supply constraints on GLP-1. And so some of those restraints were relieved in the first quarter. And frankly, our team did a really nice job with suppliers getting out there to get product to meet demand in our stores. And so our sales exceeded what we expected to see in the first quarter and that put a little bit of that unexpected pressure on margins. And then the second, there's another category of drugs as well, where we saw some regulatory restrictions that were unexpected that drove up the cost on those meds and put some pressure on the margin. So when we talked about some unexpected trends in Pharmacy, it was really around product mix in those couple of areas, and wanted to make sure we called it out, because we do see that carrying over into the second part of the year, it wasn't necessarily reimbursement related.
Rodney McMullen: And as we look longer term, three years or five years, we definitely think there'll be less capacity. And as you noted, there's a significant number of closures by the other three players in that space. And there's a lot of work that's being done from a governmental standpoint around PBMs. The thing that I get super excited about, our pharmacies and our Health & Wellness teams, they continue to do a great job of improving the experience. And I think it's amazing that a third of our customers don't even realize we have a pharmacy. And we're obviously working incredibly hard to make sure that third of our customers that don't even realize we have a custom that we have a pharmacy to get them to convert and become a patient of our pharmacy because our teams do an amazing job on service. We have incredibly quick lines and things like that and it's one less trip that somebody has to make. So thanks, John, for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.
Michael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Michael Lasser: Rodney, between some of the comments from other food -- morning -- before -- between some of the comments from other food retailers, as well as your own discussion around increased price investments, there is a perception that the industry is becoming more competitive and that is going to disrupt the profitability of food retail in the back half of the year. So could you compare where the overall promotional intensity that you're witnessing is today versus where it's been in the past, especially around disruptive times? And how much did your price investment contribute to the improvement that you saw in more price-sensitive customers, lower income consumers, in the quarter?
Rodney McMullen: In terms of overall, I would say, in terms of promotional activity looks very similar to pre-COVID and for the first time it finally starts looking and feeling more like pre-COVID times. As I mentioned a second ago, overall, we saw more prices go up than go down, when you look at the individual number of SKUs. I feel really good about where we are and I feel good about our teams and their ability to continue taking care of customers. In terms of the valued customer, I think, a lot of it is driven more from some of the things that we've done relative to our new brand in terms of Smart Way, helping that customer understand that they can come and shop with us and it's -- and you don't have to compromise relative to fresh and quality and some of those other aspects and experience -- the customer experience or associate experience that they give. So when you look at it overall, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. And part of it, I think, is just the moderating inflation, but we still continue to expect a little bit of inflation.
Michael Lasser: My follow-up question is that Kroger's financial formula works very well when its ID sales are above 3%. When is a realistic expectation that it could resume seeing ID sales back at that level?
Todd Foley: I think you're right. Our model is to drive 2% to 4% ID sales. And as you looked at -- we talked a lot last quarter around the dynamics of inflation and what we saw last year with the rapid disinflation throughout the year. And as we get back to this year, that more normal inflation environment that Rodney alluded to, and we start cycling those heavy disinflations. We talk about the -- getting towards the high end of our guidance range relative to sales by the second half of the year and I think that starts to get us back into that range that our long-term model is based on in the 2% to 4%.
Rodney McMullen: And the other thing, it's a great question. It's hard to give a specific data other than I can assure you that our team is working really hard to get there. We're also -- and this is something I would say we've always done, but you always try to get better. And if you look at capital investments, we would also be using capital investments to support that growth. And as you know, we're starting to increase the number of stores that we're opening. And the maturity of those stores and the remodel of those stores also help with identicals over time. And we would expect that to obviously be the case now. And as Todd mentioned, it's early in the slightly higher capital spending for new stores and expansions and stuff, but we're pleased with the early results. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore.
Michael Montani: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could discuss the ID sales cadence through the quarter and then in the month of June. How should we think about ID sales for 2Q? And then I had a follow-up.
Todd Foley: Yeah, the first quarter was a little choppy because we had a Easter mismatch relative to the calendar. But the general trend throughout the quarter was that we saw IDs increase steadily as we went through the quarter on average. And then as we look to Q2 to date, so far, we're right on plan relative to our expectations for Q2 results in the guidance that we've given.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, and as you know, we do expect IDs to improve throughout the year and we continue -- so far we're continuing to see that and would expect that to continue.
Michael Montani: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just wanted to try to better get the arms around some of the pharmacy pressures, is there anything that you could point to in the back half of the year, whether it be comparison-based or otherwise, that would help to alleviate some of those pressures or perhaps other sources of profit, whether it be media or fuel that could offset somewhat?
Rodney McMullen: I'll make a couple of comments, and Todd, feel free to add. One of the things as you get to the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter is vaccines. And as you know, last year our teams did an amazing job of increasing the number of vaccines we gave. And we have a ton of learnings that we think will be able to do that again this year. And the -- so when you look at just the pharmacy business, part of that will be that. And also on some of the supply issues, we would hope that and expect for those to get more normalized and like the one drug that Todd was talking about, the generics, as they come out and stuff, historically, that's always improved profitability. And we would expect at some point in this latter part of the year for those things to happen. Relative to the other pieces, Todd, I'll let you.
Todd Foley: You're right on with what I was going to say on pharmacy, Rodney, and just overall with the business. I alluded to earlier, the margin expansion efforts that we're seeing, and those are all factored into the guidance for the rest of the year. And even given those pharmacy headwinds, we expect the pharmacy or the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion initiatives that we have blended with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out should enable us to achieve gross profit results beyond what we saw in the first quarter.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Edward Kelly: I wanted to start two questions. The first question I had is just around -- good morning -- it's just around the second quarter guidance. So in Q1, you beat on lower fuel margins and lower pharmacy. Q2, the guidance is coming down. Is that just solely based on pharmacy and incentive comp? Is there something else happening within here? I'm just trying to figure out the level of conservatism that is sitting in the second quarter guidance given what you just did in Q2 against all of this.
Todd Foley: Yeah, no, you're right. And it is primarily based on pharmacy and incentive. You are correct. From a fuel perspective, that's so volatile. It's really week to week. It's part of what we keep our eye on as we go forward. So far it has been closer to our expectations for the quarter, but that's one that we truly monitor daily and weekly to understand the impact it's having on the business.
Edward Kelly: All right. Then I guess a quick follow-up is just on leverage. So you continue to reiterate your leverage target. You are well below that at this point. Taking a step back, are there any advantages that you see to the business to running below the target long-term? Is this a metric that you think you would reassess post the Albertsons decision? Just curious as to how you're thinking about that.
Todd Foley: I think long-term, our targets at 2.3 to 2.5 are in the right place. That is -- one of our key objectives is to maintain our investment grade rating and over time, it's proven that is the range that enables us to be able to do that. So I think we long-term continue to look to operate within that range, with or without the merger, frankly. And the beauty with where we're at here, you're right, we do have a lot of capacity there. Obviously, we're firmly focused on closing the merger and being able to use that capacity relative to the merger and come out the other end. But I think in any scenario, the capital allocation approach that we've taken over time, we've got a long track record on what that is and how we do it. And I would expect this to execute under that framework on a go-forward basis.
Rodney McMullen: We really view our lowest cost of capital is a BBB rating. And if you look at it historically, it's like 80% of the time that would be the lowest cost of capital. And as you look at the markets going forward, we don't see anything that would cause that to change. So that gives you the financial flexibility to do things like merging with Albertsons. It also creates the lowest cost of capital. And the reason we always reiterate that 2.3 to 2.5 is that really is the point that we believe creates a solid BBB rating. And the thing that, as Todd and I both mentioned, the business continues to be incredibly strong from a free cash flow standpoint and the anticipation going forward. So it gives us the opportunity to continue to invest in the business, continue to grow the business, and we can't wait to be able to merge with Albertsons, so we can do that at even a scale a little bit bigger. So thanks, Ed, for the questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO.
Kelly Bania: Hi. Good morning. This is Kelly Bania from BMO.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Kelly Bania: Just wanted to ask about the volume and the tonnage outlook. I think you mentioned some positive momentum with the budget consumers and maybe an increasing customer count there. But how are volumes and tonnage trending year-over-year within your different customer cohorts? And how is that impacting your outlook for the full year in terms of tonnage and volume overall?
Rodney McMullen: If you look, the tonnage trends are all trying to think if there's any exception to this, they're all in the right direction and they're improving. If you look at historically, part of that, we believe, is because of the moderating inflation, part of it is because of doing a better job on in-stock and the customer experience and connecting better with each customer segment. So we feel good about those trends for multiple of reasons. Was there a follow-up question or?
Kelly Bania: Oh, yeah, thank you. I wasn't sure if you're done. Just wanted to ask maybe another question on the promotional and the competitive environment. It sounds like you characterize it maybe back to normal, I guess. What's different today about Kroger's kind of gross margin profile being more stable? And it sounds like maybe up a little bit in the next couple of quarters here relative to a few years ago, how much of that just rests on the Alternative Profit and the magnitude of that and the growth -- continued growth there versus anything different that you see in the gross margin for the kind of the core business?
Todd Foley: Yeah, Kelly, I think it's -- you hit on part of it. I don't think it's just Alternative Profit. I think we have today more levers maybe than we've had in the past to be able to drive that value through margin expansion. So it's Alternative Profit and retail media. It's what our merchants do. We've already talked a little bit today about our brands and the value that our brand brings and the margin expansion there. And same with Fresh. I think it's all of those areas. And I think it's also the things that we continue to do with process improvement, whether it's in supply chain, whether it's continuing to drive down shrink, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's the variety of margin improvement initiatives that we have. It is -- it's what's a little different than maybe what we saw several years ago, because we have various sources of value to help fund those investments in our customers and in our associates frankly.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. And if you look at some of the things that's in margin, like, warehouse and transportation costs, our teams are making good progress there, reducing the number of empty miles, taking and managing more of the transportation. So there's a lot -- one of the things, as you know, we've done a ton of work over the last five years or 10 years on diversifying our business model and how we create value. And part of it is the traffic that our base business creates being able to monetize that in ways that the customer actually views and finds of value. Thanks, Kelly.
Operator: And our next question comes from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank.
Krisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the store execution plan that you implemented with the daily scoring system. Now you're really addressing some of the underperforming stores relative to the chain average. So one is what has been the biggest opportunity for some of the store-level improvements you're seeing? Just how much are they contributing to the traffic gains that you are also seeing? And just how best to think about further upside with both your budget-conscious customers but also the mainstream and the premium customers?
Rodney McMullen: When you look at upside, I think, our whole team feels incredibly good. If you were in one of our meetings, you would hear us talk about all the things that we can get better at, and it's things that matter to our associates and matter to our customers. So we're incredibly excited about the continued opportunity we have on getting better. On the store execution, obviously, they always say retail is detail and it literally is working with every single store. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, turnover continue to improve. When turnover is lower, when retention is better, it helps on the experience, it helps on the execution in the store, on in-stocks and other things. Our teams are doing a very good job on Fresh and that's everything from our supply chain to our folks ordering product to using AI to make sure the right stores get the right product, to the stores getting it out on the shelf and helping the customer have a couple more days of freshness at home. So it's really all of those things together that we think it's what's driving the increased traffic and increased in connection with our customers. So it's obviously super proud of the whole team and excited about the opportunities going in front of us.
Krisztina Katai: Great. And just a quick follow-up. I hate to beat this, but just on the promo backdrop, just how should we think about your promotional basket? How much of that is proactive versus reactive that you are doing in the current environment? And I think you said that it's pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. Is it fair to assume that your vendor funding is also in line with pre-COVID levels or do you anticipate that to continue to ramp as your vendors are focusing on driving volumes? Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look at vendor funding, we would expect it to continue to increase because you know that CPGs are trying to move tonnage. If you look at overall, we would, I think, feel like it's pretty much backed up pre-COVID but at a higher level. Some CPGs have increased their margins without, so they're just making flat-out more profit. So we think they actually have room to even further invest in trade dollars.
Todd Foley: To your comment on reactive versus proactive, when we put our plan together for the year and our guidance in the whole nine yards, we put together our pricing strategy for the year and we're executing on the strategy that we've put in place and we think clearly customers are responding to that very favorably. We're not deviating from the plan that we have -- that we've put into place. We're executing our playbook. Rodney mentioned it earlier. It's what we've done for 15 years or 20 years and we've stuck to our playbook and we think that's what's resonating with our customers.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, there isn't things that are going on out there that I would say that's causing us to be reactive. You always pay attention and I spend as much time getting to the competitors' store as I do our own stores. But when I look at overall, we're running our plan and we're using our data and insights to make sure that we're taking care of our customers and associates. So I feel really good about where we are overall on that. So thanks for the questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.
Chuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning, Chuck.
Chuck Cerankosky: I was cut off for a while, but it sounded like you said, Rodney, that your delivery sales doubled year-over-year in the first quarter. What's driving that? Is it just your execution or the customer demand? And when you look at customer demand for delivered groceries, how does it break down between budget-conscious customers and more affluent customers?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. If you look, sorry that you got cut off, but the delivery business almost doubled year-on-year. It's pretty broad based on all customer segments, but I think one of the things that's important to remember is that our technology allows us to do a better job now accepting SNAP and some of those things than what it did a year ago. So it's really across all customers. I think the thing that's driving it is our teams are doing a nice job on making sure the experience is good. I can tell you in Florida, people get ice cream that's still frozen and chocolate that's not melted because of our delivery, because of the delivery trucks. And it's really -- it's one of those things where all the things you feel good about, we still have a lot of work to make sure that we're satisfied with the profitability.
Chuck Cerankosky: Are there any CPG promotions or monies made available to help get that customer to make the first delivery order?
Rodney McMullen: Yes. The short answer is yes. And there's, as you know, online and with our data and personalization, there's all kinds of things that you're learning in terms of different customers find it attractive at different times. So the short answer is absolutely yes. The other thing is, obviously online really supports the Alternative Profit business as well from a media standpoint. Thanks, Chuck.
Chuck Cerankosky: Thanks, Rodney. Good luck for the rest of the year.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: The question-and-answer session is now finished. So I will hand back over to Rodney for any final remarks.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you for all the questions, as always. As you know, I always like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. Today I'd like to take a moment to celebrate Alex Spurlock. Alex is a store leader at QFC store 860 in Redmond, Washington, and recently was named the 2024 Food Industry Association Store Leader of the Year. Obviously, this is a huge honor and we are so impressed by the amazing work that Alex does at her store. With more than a decade in the grocery business, Alex understands the industry. She has a gentle spirit and a fierce attention to detail that clearly earned her this recognition. What's most impressive is Alex's passion for her associates. She is always ready to coach her team and celebrate their success in meaningful ways. Thank you and congratulations, Alex, for everything you do for our customers and your fellow associates. And congratulations on this amazing honor. And thank you to all of our teams for all the work they do every day to take care of each other and our associates and thank you for everyone for joining us today.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. Have a nice day. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-03-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Please note this event is being recorded.  
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. This morning, we released a presentation to accompany our call today, which can be found on our Investor Relations web page at ir.kroger.com. We encourage you to refer to these materials as Rodney and Gary will make references to the presentation throughout the call. During our prepared remarks, we will share our fourth quarter and full year results. We will update you on the progress  our team has made since our Investor Day last year on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. We look forward to returning to a full Investor Day in 2024, where we expect to share detailed plans for how we will achieve synergies and maximize shareholder value from our merger with Albertsons.  
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary.
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by sharing how incredibly optimistic I am about Kroger's future. Our performance last year demonstrates how Kroger is consistently delivering for our customers, our associates and our communities and by doing so, creating value for our shareholders. Since announcing our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, we have made tremendous progress against our commitments.  
 As you will see from the chart on Slide 6 of the presentation deck Rob mentioned, we are delivering a fresh, affordable and seamless shopping experience for our customers with 0 compromise on value, quality, selection or convenience. We are advancing our purpose to feed the human spirit by significantly increasing associate wages and uplifting our communities. And we are delivering on our financial commitments through our strong resilient value creation model. With this strategy, we exceeded our financial goals and delivered attractive total shareholder returns during the past 2 years.  
 In 2022, customer preferences shifted in response to inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers were looking for more ways to stretch their budget. The gap between food at home and food away from home spending grew in the fourth quarter as more customers gravitated toward affordable meal solutions that restaurants simply can't provide. Our research shows that cooking at home is 3 to 4x less expensive than dining out. And as Kroger was there for our customers, innovating quickly to meet their needs and wants, our nimble and customer-focused approach helped us deliver strong results in 2022, leading to total household growth and enhanced customer loyalty. We saw an especially strong response in our higher income households as this segment grew by 1.1 million households, further illustrating the resiliency in our model and strong value proposition we offer customers across all segments.  
 Gary will get into the specific details of our 2022 financial results and outlook for 2023 a little later. Before doing so, I'd like to spend some time reviewing how each pillar of our go-to-market strategy provided meaningful and measurable customer benefits last year and how we will accelerate those benefits in 2023. The foundation of our go-to-market strategy is fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless. By delivering on these 4 pillars, our customers win and Kroger attracts new and more loyal customers. At the center of our go-to-market strategy is a superior customer experience. We deliver that by consistently providing customers a full, fresh and friendly experience.  
 Kroger continued to demonstrate operational excellence in 2022 as we saw improvements in all 3 metrics. We believe our go-to-market strategy is creating a unique value -- customer value proposition designed to perform in many economic environments. We will continue to invest in our pillars and the customer experience to differentiate the value we offer.  
 First, leading with fresh. As an important influence on where customers shop, we are constantly improving how we bring even fresher food to our stores and e-commerce experience. Our end-to-end fresh initiative is changing the way our teams deliver on our commitment to freshness and we are incredibly pleased with this success. In 2022, more than 1,400 stores implemented the end-to-end produce solution, driving measurable increases in both fresh and total store sales. In 2023, we will continue innovating the fresh experience to drive customer satisfaction and improve our product mix. We continue to improve inventory management tools, strengthen our supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness and enhance our offerings to meet customer demand.  
 As a reminder, our merger with Home Chef brought significant capabilities in in-store and restaurant quality meal solutions. We will be expanding our home chef production facilities to meet this growing customer need.  
 Next, Our Brands. The Our Brands portfolio allows us to offer exciting products at great value while driving incremental sales and improving margins. Our Brand's quality and value proposition is especially important when inflation is affecting so many of our customers' lives. To meet the needs of customers on a budget, we launched a new opening price point product line called Smart Way. By consolidating and simplifying several brands into one, we are making it easier for customers while creating a point of differentiation across the full portfolio. We will continue expanding Our Brands to more categories with innovative product offerings. Our goal is to help every customer find high-quality, affordable products they love from pantry staples to fresh food to ready-to-heat restaurant quality meals.  
 Now I'll move to personalization. Our data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time and at the best value. Because we know our customers so well, we were able to provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money and making their lives easier. In return, our customers reward us with their trust and loyalty, consistently ranking us among the best at being able to offer personalized savings and solutions that meet their needs.  
 In 2022, we grew loyalty as our customers more deeply engaged with personalized coupons and fuel rewards. As customers look for more ways to save, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high during the year. Our combined paper and digital coupons helped save our customers more than $1.4 billion on products they need and want. That's on top of our everyday promotions and all the other value we offer.  
 To provide even more value, we launched Boost, the industry's most affordable membership nationwide in July. Early results are exceeding our expectations with incremental engagement and overall household spend. We are evolving Boost with new benefits to further broaden its appeal and create additional customer value. In 2023, we will make significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next 3 years.  
 Finally, turning to Seamless. Seamless is growing in importance among our customers, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver over the next several years. We have built a digital platform that offers a seamless shopping experience with 0 compromise, allowing customers to shift effortlessly between store, pickup and delivery solutions.  
 As you'll see on Slide 12, our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers positions Kroger to serve all customer trips from in-stock shopping to rapid delivery on needed now items to large stock up orders. Despite the easing of pandemic-related shopping behaviors that led to a significant increase in online shopping, more and more customers are incorporating e-commerce into their daily permanent routines, recognizing the value and convenience online shopping offers. We expect digital sales will continue to grow at a faster pace than overall food at home sales and believe Kroger is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in over the next 3 years.  
 As we work to become the most trusted online grocery destination, we are focused on 4 key areas that will position us to deliver that growth. We start by providing a compelling Kroger owned digital destination, where we offer customers exceptional value, personalization and freshness in a single, easy-to-use online experience. Second, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment, driving trust and loyalty by exceeding expectations for quality and freshness. Our delivery approach is unique in the fact that we have a large store network conveniently located close to our customers and large dedicated fulfillment centers designed efficiently to pick large orders. Our dedicated fulfillment centers provide the most reliable experience, the highest in-stock levels, best on-time delivery and one-of-a-kind white glove experience with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores.  
 Kroger delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with us more often. Looking ahead, we will continue to learn through our customer fulfillment network with a focus on driving profitability and efficiencies to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while delighting our customers.  
 Next, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Our delivery network allows us to offer enhanced service to new customers, and we will also grow our share of wallet by increasing the number of orders customers place with us. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores can connect customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes. This seamless ecosystem makes any shopping experience simple for our customers.  
 Finally, we are driving our profit flywheel and improving margins by reducing our digital cost to serve and growing our alternative profit streams. To accomplish this goal, we are lowering fulfillment costs, building the density of demand and last mile routing, engaging directly with our third-party vendors and growing digital retail media.  
 Now let me share how we are accelerating growth in our model through alternative profits. During the last several years, we invested heavily in technology to transform our business and enter new high-growth and high-return businesses. These businesses contribute meaningfully to our results with alternative profit businesses achieving $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. Kroger Precision Marketing is one of our fastest-growing businesses and is well positioned to win within the U.S. retail media landscape, which is projected to be a $55 billion industry by 2024. What makes our retail media business special is our ability to help brands achieve a greater return on their media investment.  
 For the fifth year in a row, KPM was recognized as a leader in the retail media space by the Path to Purchase Institute, which collects feedback from those closest to the retail media networks and accessing their effectiveness. KPM was recognized as a leader for many of its capabilities, including maintaining its leadership in targeting and measurement capabilities, a testament to the strength of our unique product offerings and the insights we bring to this emerging landscape. Our associates enable our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs.  
 To remain an employer of choice, we support our associates development and holistic well-being. We provide our associates with the tools they need to grow their careers that they want at all stages. In 2022, Kroger was named as a Best Place to Work in IT for the fifth consecutive year and a best place to work for disability inclusion for the third year. We also continue to support our associates through investments in wages and comprehensive benefits. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6% and has now invested an incremental $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018. Our average hourly rate is now more than $18 and more than $23 when you include comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing associate wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in associates in 2023. We value and respect our associates and investing in their success is just one way we demonstrate that.  
 We take seriously our role in helping to create a healthier and thriving neighborhoods across the country. The centerpiece of our efforts is Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan, an industry-leading commitment to build communities free from hunger and waste. Since launching Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, we have made continual progress toward our goals. We have directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, including donating more than 2.3 billion meals. We are making progress on our carbon emissions reduction plan and our brand's sustainable packaging goal. I'm especially proud of our incredible associates who helped us reach a key milestone this year with 100% execution of our surplus food rescue programs across each and every store across the company.  
 Looking ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on our ambitious goal of ending hunger in our communities and eliminating waste, especially food waste throughout the company.  In summary, our proven go-to-market strategy led to enhanced loyalty and household growth as we help customers manage the effect of inflation in 2022. We are well positioned to sustain our momentum into 2023.  
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our results and expectations for 2023. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into our 2022 results and sharing our outlook for 2023, I'd like to take a step back and remind you how Kroger's value creation model is enabling the company to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our value creation model has been a key to delivering consistently strong results over the past 4 years and is positioning Kroger for growth in years to come.  
 The go-to-market strategy that Rodney outlined earlier is the foundation of our model. Over recent years, we have invested significantly in our people, our customers and technology to create a leading omnichannel position in food retail. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we win customers in our core supermarket business, including health and fuel and drive significant customer traffic and data into our ecosystem. This, in turn, allows us to deploy our investments in technology and 84.51° to deliver even greater value for customers and create new high-growth, high-margin alternative profit businesses.  
 The value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our supermarkets and drive further store and digital traffic, creating a flywheel effect. We are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse food first business that we believe can deliver sustainable future growth and succeed in a variety of operating environments.  
 As a reminder, since introducing this model in 2019, we have achieved consistent returns for our shareholders that have significantly exceeded our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%.  As you can see in the table on Slide 19, over the past 3 years, Kroger has achieved more than 19% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted FIFO net operating profit and approximately 25% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Over this same time period, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $9.7 billion and have returned a total of nearly $5.8 billion to investors via dividends and buybacks.  
 Overall, we have delivered nearly 3x the expected return from our TSR model over this 3-year period. Importantly, at the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support future growth. This included improving our price position relative to key competitors since the start of the pandemic, increasing associate wages and benefits by 34% since 2018 and increasing the amount of capital investments allocated to technology and digital capabilities to enable top line growth and margin expansion.  
 Our strong performance and progress with our model in recent years also gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to announce our proposed merger with Albertsons. Upon closing, which is anticipated to be in early 2024, we believe the merger will significantly accelerate our go-to-market strategy and deliver TSR well above our stand-alone model during the first 4 years post close.  
 I'll now walk through our full year 2022 financial results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.23 per diluted share, an increase of 15%. We achieved identical sales, excluding fuel of 5.6%. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 9 basis points. This reflects the outstanding work of our merchandising and sourcing teams who are extremely effective in managing higher product cost inflation while maintaining competitive prices and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 19 basis points, reflecting sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by planned investments in associates. And I'm delighted to say for the fifth consecutive year, we delivered cost savings of $1 billion in 2022. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5.1 billion, an increase of 18% from last year. And the LIFO charge for the full year was $626 million compared to $197 million in 2021.  
 Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter, an increase of almost 9%. We saw continued momentum in our identical sales without fuel of 6.2%. Underlying growth would have been 6.7% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts. Our Brands contributed another strong quarter with identical sales of 10.1%, reflecting the growing importance to customers of these exclusive to Kroger products. And digital sales also accelerated during the quarter, up 12%, led by 22% growth in Delivery Solutions. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 1 basis point and the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 56 basis points.  
 Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Our loyalty program, which can save customers up to $1.25 per gallon has been one of the many ways we have helped customers stretch their dollars over the past year and contributed to our gallon sales outpacing the industry during the quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $3.39 compared to $3.30 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.51 compared to $0.44 in the same quarter last year.  
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.27 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. And the LIFO charge was $234 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery. This compares to a charge of only $20 million in Q4 last year.  
 Included in our fourth quarter results was a $164 million goodwill and fixed asset impairment charge related to Vitacost.com. The talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize Kroger store pickup and delivery capabilities, and this reprioritization resulted in the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform, providing great value, natural, organic and eco-friendly products for our customers.  
 Adjusted free cash flow for the year came in $800 million lower than anticipated. This was entirely due to movements in working capital towards the end of the year. The cause was a combination of factors including higher inflation affecting inventory, some forward buying to protect margins and timing of accounts payable and third-party receivable payments around the year-end. As shared last quarter, we feel comfortable with our overall level of mix of inventory, which is higher due to heightened levels of inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
 Looking over a 5-year time horizon and smoothing the volatility in working capital experience during the pandemic, we have seen an underlying benefit from working capital over this time period, and we would expect to see further improvement going forward. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. And as shared in our guidance this morning, expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2023.  
 Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We will continue to be disciplined with our capital investments, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. As you saw in our guidance this morning, we are anticipating capital investments of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year, which is consistent with our long-range TSR model. Our priorities for 2023 are aligned with our value creation model and are expected to drive future sales growth and margin expansion.  
 To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing our store and digital ecosystem. We apply a data-driven approach to make decisions on a store-by-store basis, prioritizing store formats and locations with the highest growth potential. Additionally, we are continually enhancing our seamless experience including investing in technology to improve the customer proposition and augmenting personalization, which will, in turn, create additional alternative profit opportunities. We continue to invest in areas of the business that will drive operating margin expansion, including enhancements to our supply chain capabilities. These investments help improve margins and differentiate our fresh offering.  
 And finally, an essential element of our value creation model has been our ability to take cost out of our business. We remain focused on eliminating waste in areas that did not affect the customer experience and we are making investments in technology to improve store productivity, lower digital fulfillment costs and reduce waste and shrink. These improvements will drive an incremental $1 billion of cost savings in 2023, which would mark our sixth year in a row of delivering $1 billion of savings.  
 In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our expectations for 2023. While there is still uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, our go-to-market strategy is resonating with customers, and we believe our successful value creation model positions us well to navigate evolving market conditions.  
 Before I go into the details of our 2023 guidance, there are a couple of unusual factors that I'd like to highlight. First, Kroger's decision to terminate our agreement with Express Groups in December of 2022 is expected to have a negative impact of 150 basis points on identical sales without fuel. This decision is not expected to have a material effect on profitability.  
 Second, 2023 will include a 53rd week. We expect the effect of this extra week at approximately $0.15 to our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year. With that important context, we expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 1% to 2% in 2023. Excluding the effect of Express Scripts, our underlying identical sales without fuel growth is expected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect to achieve adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $5 billion and $5.2 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of between $4.45 and $4.60, including the expected benefit of the 53rd week.  
 We expect to grow revenue by continuing to invest in our customers through competitive pricing and personalization and providing fresh products and a better shopping experience across our store and digital ecosystem. We will fund investments in gross margin in 2023 by improving our product mix as we accelerate momentum with our Fresh and Our Brands initiatives and by growing our alternative profit businesses.  
 As Rodney mentioned earlier, we will also continue to invest significantly in associate wages and this will be funded by our planned cost-saving initiatives. While we believe fuel margins will remain structurally higher than historical averages, fuel profitability is expected to be a headwind to our model in 2023 as we lap historic fuel margins from last year. Our 2023 guidance assumes a LIFO charge of between $300 million to $350 million as a result of lower product cost inflation compared to 2022. While this amount is well above historical levels, LIFO is expected to be a year-over-year tailwind and should more than offset lower fuel profitability.  
 In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be above the top end of our guidance range in the first half of the year as we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation. In the second half of the year, we expect identical sales without fuel to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our range as we expect inflation to taper later in the year. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share in quarter 1 will be slightly negative year-over-year as we cycle 22% growth in EPS from Q1 last year. Quarter 2 and quarter 3 are expected to be within our annual guidance range and quarter 4 is expected to be above our guidance range as we cycle the higher LIFO charge in '22 and benefit from the 53rd week.  
 As you know from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and the investments that we have made in our go-to-market strategy provide exciting opportunities for future growth. Our team is energized by these opportunities and we believe Kroger is well positioned to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders.  
 I'll now turn the call back over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. During the past few months, we've spent time getting to know Vivek and the Albertsons leadership team. We are incredibly impressed with their talent, culture and commitment to their customers and communities. We look forward to bringing together our 2 highly complementary organizations to provide customers with lower prices and more choices while realizing the long-term value we expect this merger will deliver.  
 We are working cooperatively with regulators responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request and in discussions about the transaction, while also working to identify potential buyers for the stores, we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We are pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders. We remain on track to close the transaction in early 2024.  
 During the quarter, we launched our integration planning efforts with the goal of preparing for a seamless cultural and operational integration. We expect to create customer benefits beginning day 1 post close. The integration team is developing work streams with clear objectives and milestones to deliver value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we have them.  
 We achieved exceptional results in 2022, building on our record years in 2020 and 2021, and we exceeded our commitments in our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy. Our folks strategy is focusing on our customers, our associates and our communities is working. Our customers are telling us that we're doing a better job serving their needs. We continue to improve our associate wages and comprehensive benefits with a 34% increase in the last 5 years. And we are helping to create healthier thriving communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste work. We believe our momentum is sustainable and will only accelerate upon the completion of our pending merger with Albertsons.  
 With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. 
John Heinbockel: Rodney, I wanted to start with since it's the beginning of a new year. As you guys think about your consumer deciles, quartiles, however you look at it, what's the wallet share opportunity right, maybe from the average consumer to your best, most loyal consumer. And where is the -- when you do sort of a gap analysis, where is the gap? Is it fresh? Where are the biggest pockets, right, where the average consumer is not spending as much as the most loyal. 
W. McMullen: And John, thanks. I love the question. And we always look at it slightly different because we look at the opportunity is all the business. And even in places where we over-index, there's still a lot of opportunity. Customers that are most loyal to us will still spend 30% to 50% of their spending somewhere other than Kroger. And that's an opportunity for us to improve our position. When you look at Fresh, we start off with a higher share of Fresh than we do in the other parts. But it's an area where we're meaningfully better than our competitors. So our ability and focus on growing our business is to really -- what we find is full Fresh and friendly resonates with all customer types, and we do it in a way where there's 0 compromise.  
 So a customer on a budget can get great value from Our Brands. They can save 7% to 10% by buying Our Brands versus national brand. If you look at our Home Chef and products related to that, a customer can get a meal for 1/3 to 1/4 of what it costs going out. So it's really all of those together. And our opportunity -- our sweet spot is always the customer that likes a good value for the money and Fresh is incredibly important and friendly is incredibly important. That's our sweet spot where we connect the best and that is a growing area across the U.S., and we operate in many markets that are growing as well. So for us, that's really our sweet spot and our opportunity and our strategy is oriented around that. And then technology just provides the support for that make it easier for the customer. 
John Heinbockel: Great. Maybe secondly, right, if you look at the Express Scripts impact, so how much of that is pharmacy versus none, right? And I know you guys have always said pharmacy customers among the most loyal customers. How do you think about losing trips, right, because of this and then maybe using right, your data, okay, we know who -- I think you know who the Express Scripts customers were. We can do incremental outreach to make sure we don't lose trips with those particular households. 
W. McMullen: If you look the numbers that Gary provided by far, the majority of that's pharmacy. Our teams are doing great work on using our discount cards to be able to help customers identify other alternatives. And in fact, in many cases, they're saving money. We're also going directly with some other companies to provide the benefit rather than going through a PBM. So by far, the majority of the estimate that Gary provided is pharmacy. And we're using the things that you said to make sure that we don't lose that customer connection and we don't lose the trip to the grocery store.  
 I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: I think you said it well, Rodney.  I think that John described it, but work the team has done around using our data and personalization to make sure we're protecting the customer. We think it's working. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Thanks for all the color. A question for you to start. Rodney, just kind of big picture. We're coming off of an inflationary cycle that really none of us have ever sort of seen before. And obviously, there are a lot of implications associated with that. But as you look forward into '23 and sort of thought about providing guidance, how do you think the industry is going to evolve off of the heels of that? Meaning what's the level of inflation that you've embedded within your ID guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% ex Express.
 How do you think about like the promotional backdrop and how that changes? Are you happy with your underlying tonnage for instance or volume given what's happened with pricing and what we've seen with comps at some like value players like Walmart, et cetera. Just kind of curious, is that how all of that played into the way you're thinking about guidance? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at inflation overall, we would expect inflation to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year and the quarterly insights that Gary provided really reflected that. If you look at the thing that we feel really good about, and I shared specifics on the prepared comments, the higher income customer is really resonating with our value proposition, and we're having meaningful increases there in terms of that customer.  
 And one of the things I always think it's important for people to realize is the profitability of that customer is higher as well because they shop for the full mix of our stores and they would be buying more produce in Fresh departments and Deli bakery, which is driving some of that profitability shift. So when you look at overall, we feel really good on how we're connecting with our customers. We feel really good at how we're improving on Fresh. And when you look at the share that we're getting with the customer that really focuses on that, we feel good about. When you look at it overall, we're always striving to do better. And I feel good about the progress we're making. We're excited about the opportunities we have in front of us, and we still think we can continue to do better.  In terms of specifics on inflation, Gary, I'll let you share the specific inflation assumption because it's pretty -- during the year, it's obviously pretty wide range. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Ed. From an inflation perspective, what we're seeing at the moment is that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, inflation has really sort of stabilized. And what we're starting to see is in the Fresh categories, sort of deceleration of inflation, but grocery is -- has remained pretty stubborn in terms of the levels there.  
 So we're assuming, as Rodney mentioned, in the first half of the year that a gradual decline, probably grocery remaining fairly stubborn where it is today, but some of the Fresh categories continuing to show some deceleration. And then we're expecting sort of towards the end of the year that we get to sort of between low and mid-single-digit inflation level rates about sort of 4% to 5% would be our assumption around where we think inflation starts to come down to in the way that we build our assumptions for the year. And obviously, Our Brand... 
Edward Kelly: Okay, just a quick followup... 
Gary Millerchip: Go ahead, Ed. 
Edward Kelly: Got you. Just a quick follow-up, Gary. The FIFO gross margin outlook for '23. I think there is a decent -- I mean, it seems like there's a decent impact associated with Express, given there's no P&L impact of losing the comp. Just how are you thinking about FIFO gross margin ex fuel in '23? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. As you know, we generally don't get into a ton of specific guidance. But I would say, in general, we're thinking and the way we built our model is very much in balance and consistent with what we delivered in 2022 in terms of -- when you think about gross margin, we'll be continuing to invest in the customer in key areas of value whatever important to them, whether that's pricing, promotions continuing to roll out Boost, which creates a short-term headwind as you build the loyalty of the customer and get the incremental value over a longer period of time.  
 We believe that there'll be some continued meaningful tailwinds in our gross margin rate as we continue to execute on our go-to-market strategy. So thinking about alternative profit streams. The work I mentioned in my prepared remarks about continuing to see improvement in Our Brands penetration, which is helpful to gross margin. And so we overall, think it's going to be a pretty balanced year. There's an awful lot going in there as we're investing in the customer, investing in the experience. But as our model is now kind of reaching more of a rhythm and maturity of delivering on those gross margin improvements that we're able to balance those things.  
 I would say from an Express Scripts point of view and some of the other work that we've done around Kroger Specialty Pharmacy are making sure that we're really focusing on profitable growth in our health and wellness business that those probably create a call it, a sort of 10 basis point tailwind in gross margin, but a 10 basis point headwind in OG&A. It's kind of net, net neutral in terms of the operating profit impact, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but it will change the optics a bit just because the sort of pulling those sales numbers out of our overall business model. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: My first question, it's a little similar to Ed's question. If you look at the FIFO EBIT guided for 2023, essentially, call it, flattish. I'm just rounding relative to '22. If you divide the business up into core, I don't know alternative and maybe gas as profit pools, and I don't know if those would be the right 3, the big ones to focus on. Can you give us a sense of the movement within getting to that flat -- roughly flat for EBIT year-over-year? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think what I'd probably say, Simeon, as I think about it, the sort of 3 bigger picture moving parts that I tried to sort of tee up the overall guidance with as well. So I think about it as the 53rd week adding, call it, $0.15 of earnings per share. So that's helping with -- think of $0.01 of about $9 million to $10 million. So I think if it's like $150 million tailwind from the 53rd week. I think of gas, so fuel being a headwind of -- in the sort of $200 million to $250 million range.  
 And then I would think of the sort of core supermarket business is really sort of continuing to grow year-over-year. So the gap is more than offsetting the impact of the 53rd week.  The core supermarket business sort of executing on our value creation model, as I mentioned. So underlying sales growth in that 2.5% to 3.5% growth because the Express Scripts business really hasn't contribute to the bottom line, continuing to invest in the customer, continuing to execute on our plans around driving cost out of the business and improving mix and those things net overall getting us to a slight improvement.  And I'll probably -- we won't get into the specifics obviously of breaking down the individual pieces, but we really categorize all profit as part of the overall ecosystem because we don't have media revenue unless we're driving the digital supermarket business. So we very much look at it as a total ecosystem. 
Simeon Gutman: Right. And then as a follow-up on the backdrop regarding pricing inflation, it seems like the backdrop is maybe more oligopolistic than one would have thought, not that it's not competitive out there, but in terms of price and wondering what that's a function of and maybe what could disrupt it? Is that a fair assessment? 
W. McMullen: We would certainly describe it and look at it different than that. And we've invested in pricing -- I'm trying to remember for the last 20 years or so every single year and would expect to continue to do that. And we fund that through process change, identifying other things to get costs out. And an awful lot of our promotions are much more directed personalized to the customer. So it's not what you see when you go to a store to look on a shelf because we provide a significant higher percentage of our value to our customers through fuel rewards and personalized offers that are connected one-on-one from -- in using technology and digital so that each person is individual. 
 So we would certainly not describe it that way. And we view it -- every year is incredibly competitive, and everybody is working hard to do a better job and the customer gets the benefit of that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Between the comments that you had indicated at the early start of the call, where you're working on the profitability of your digital business, along with what it sounds like a slowdown in the rollout of your Ocado shed this year, have you evolved your thinking on the long-term profitability of digital sales for Kroger because you had previously indicated that you expected the incremental margin on an incremental dollar of sales to be at or above an in-store dollar of incremental sales. 
W. McMullen: When you look at our digital business long term, we wouldn't see the profitability be any difference in this supermarket when you look at it over a longer period of time. And if you look, what we find is a customer when they move online, they actually after a year engage with us more in store than before. So what we're really focused on is having an ecosystem where the customer thinks food, they think Kroger. And what we're finding is the customer routinely moves back and forth between the different channels. 
 If you look at each piece of it, every single day, you're working to figure out ways to improve processes and take costs out. And then on top of it, obviously, retail media is an important part of the driver. So when you look at it long term, we really see no change in the opportunity and potential. We're incredibly excited and everything that we see, we think it will be more important in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years to have where the customer engage with us through multiple ways. And the digital channel is a critical part of that, and we find the customer engages with us digitally, even when they don't shop digitally. So for us, we see it as exciting as we did before. We don't see the long-term profitability being different. And we're working continually in terms of both internally and with our partners on how to improve processes. 
Gary Millerchip: Maybe just to add, Rodney -- Michael, to the sort of short-term answer to Rodney's long-term perspective, I would say that we are seeing the benefits flow through in the profitability that we talked about on prior investor meetings. So if you think about our existing digital business today, pick up through the store delivery, what we're seeing is the cost to serve. We had our best ever quarter for the cost to serve a digital order in the Q4 of 2022. 
 Rodney mentioned media, the amount of media revenue we generate per digital transaction continues to grow. So those are 2 of the big drivers that we expect to drive digital profitability, and we continue to see improvements in '22, and we expect improvements in '23 that were actually part of the tailwind in the financial model I described earlier. So we remain on that path and we are making good progress. 
Michael Lasser: And Gary, just to clarify that, then why slow the rollout of the Ocado sheds? And my second question just at this time. To get to the slightly below the low end of the range for ID sales by the end of the year with still low to mid-single-digit inflation, do you assume that there's going to be a unit erosion by the end of the year as -- I don't need to tell you guys, groceries are expensive and in a tough economic environment that may get worse by the end of the year. The consumer may be pulling back even further, and we just want to make sure that you factored in some conservatism into your outlook. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll try and be brief on those 2. So I think just to clarify on the first part of the question, I was describing the majority of our digital business today. So think about pickup through the stores, think about the work that we're doing in delivery to customers today. And when we share that doubling our digital profitability, that was based on those metrics. And so how do we improve the cost to serve, how do we improve digital media revenue. 
 On the customer fulfillment centers, we're very much in the middle of that journey right now of sort of 18 months or so into those first 2 facilities, really kind of fully understanding the scale of demand to how the customers behave and how you optimize that model. So I'd say more to come on that as we continue to understand that sort of key phase of those first 2 facilities really seeing the progress there on profitability. But from a customer demand, the customer experience, we're seeing all the sort of things we have hoped to have seen around customer engagement. 
W. McMullen: And we are actively looking for sites for some preannounced locations too on those and finding the sites ended up being a little bit more difficult than what we would have expected. 
Gary Millerchip: And I think just very brief on your second question, Michael. But for us, it's about maintaining flexibility. We believe we built our model to be able to adapt and to deliver value for our customers. We gave directional numbers just because I think it's helpful on inflation because of the LIFO calculation. But our expectation is our goal will be to continue to deliver more value for customers and over time grow our share and obviously make sure we meet the customer where they are and we expect the second half of the year to have some -- definitely some things that we don't know how to perfectly plan for. We need to make sure we're nimble and agile to be adapt to that because there's clearly going to be changed in the second half of the year. 
W. McMullen: And we feel good about our overall model being able to adapt in any situation in any market because we give a great value for the customer regardless. Thanks for the question, Michael. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: You mentioned that one of the reasons why working capital was higher than usual in the fourth quarter is that you were buying a little bit ahead to protect margins, I assume as inflation rises. Two underlying questions here. First, was this mainly in the grocery department. You talked about grocery being particularly tough in terms of inflation. And then maybe more importantly, I'm just curious, is there going to be an offset to this in the first quarter, maybe as you run through that higher-than-usual inventory, I guess I'm really just trying to ascertain if you're going to buy less than usual from some of your grocery vendors next quarter or this quarter. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. From our perspective, the main forward buying would be in pharmacy and some in grocery, that will be the 2 key areas that we looked at and felt there was a good opportunity to protect margins, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. From our perspective on working capital, certainly, some of the year-over-year variance would be things that we would expect to maintain because we are seeing continued higher inflation on inventory. And as we called out, we're expecting as we improve in-stock levels as we have that some of that will be sticky. 
 We would look at some of the payables and receivables timing impact and would expect that to be coming back. In fact, if we look at our cash at the end of the first period, the first month of the new year, it was actually up by $1 billion and back in line with the prior year, which obviously wasn't the case at the year-end. So we do think some of it was timing and will flow through. But obviously, we have strong plans for the year in terms of continuing to grow with our partners. And I would focus more on -- from our perspective, how we make sure we're continuing to drive free cash flow, and we feel good about our ability to do that. 
W. McMullen: And the forward buying is really driven by the economics at any given day in terms of what's available in the marketplace. If it's a good return, we'll invest the money there. If the return is not good, then you'll see the flow of benefiting working capital. 
Gary Millerchip: We didn't give exact numbers. I would also say, Ken, the forward buying would be a smaller part of the number, the timing of payments would be a bigger part of that than the actual forward buying. 
Kenneth Goldman: Got it. And then a quick follow-up.  Implied operating cash flow. It's one of the questions I'm getting from investors. You gave a CapEx number, so we can back into it, obviously. Just curious why given the strong EBIT growth this year, given some of the working capital reversals, why would it not be a little bit better than what guidance is suggesting. I know you talked a little bit about this. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on some of the underlying factors there if possible. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think I would say we try to guide to what we think is a more normalized year in 2023, Ken. Part of it, I would say we probably are being a little bit conservative because of -- we want to see how this unwind of COVID exactly plays out. A couple of examples would be if inflation does remain at high levels, obviously, that could impact inventory but also as we kind of unwind accruals on things like incentive payments, assuming we're more going to be more like an on-target incentive payment than significantly higher than on-target payout, those things can create some 1-year adjustments, too. 
 So there's a few areas that just kind of create a few wrinkles. And candidly, we're trying to be conservative to make sure we can see the flow-through of the catch-up from 2022 as well. So we feel we tried -- what we tried to do is take a conservative view of a normalized environment, but there is still some, I would say, unwinding that we wanted to make sure we understood as we reported out in 2023. 
W. McMullen: And our incentive plan is designed -- our long-term incentive plan is designed such that we are incentivized to do better than the guidance we've given. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, I think it'd be fair to say our internal goal would be higher than what we shared because we do believe it's one opportunity, but we thought it was appropriate to be conservative in the circumstances. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Also congrats on a great quarter. So I just want to touch on market share. Just curious if you look at  Kroger's performance in Q4, I'm not even sure if you have the full year data, just curious how your market share is performing versus your expectations? Because if I recall last quarter, you were starting to see improvement in the market share. 
W. McMullen: Yes. We're continuing to see improvement and if you look at internally, if you were at one of our meetings, you'd hear us continually focus on how to even continue to improve. Our objective and expectations of ourselves is to grow market share. And if you look at the higher-income shopper, in those customer segments, we did a great job gaining share in Fresh. We're doing a good job of gaining share. And I would say we're pleased with the progress, but we still are not satisfied. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. Just quarter-to-date. Any color you can provide in terms of what you're seeing just throughout the quarter? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we always get it. We always provide some insight. If you look so far, we're consistent with our expectations and Gary outlined a little bit about what we would expect quarterly between quarters to be. If you look at the first period, the first 4 weeks of the year, it's trending a little bit better than [indiscernible] but both of those were lower than the fourth quarter actual. And I want to remind you that ESI -- Express Scripts, I should say, is about 1.5%. And then I always hate to talk about weather, but weather was more friendly to us a year ago than it is this year and I don't ever want to use weather as an excuse, but it is an insight if you look at the current trends,  but the key point is we are trending where we expect it to be. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Spencer Hanus: On Our Brands, you saw that outperform the overall comp again this quarter. Are you seeing CPGs get more willing to offer trade spend just given the share losses that they're seeing? And do you think the trade down that we've seen over the last few quarters accelerate as we move through '23? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at a 5-year trend or a 10-year trend, Our Brands has picked up share on almost every year. And the only exception to that was a little bit of time during COVID where people had much more money in their pocket. If you look, I would say, all short statements and economics are wrong, but we still have several CPGs that are passed or trying to pass through costs more than probably their inflation. We would still see that they're more focused on profit and tonnage. And when that is true, that's when Our Brand continues to gain share. And that's the reason why Our Brand is performing so strongly. And if you look at historical cycles, eventually, that what you outlined will happen, but it hasn't started happening yet. 
Spencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then on fuel margins, you called out $0.51 during the prepared remarks, which is up more than 50% versus what it was in 2019. So  just curious how you're thinking about the sustainability of fuel margins and where those will ultimately be baseline as it just becomes a bigger part of your overall operating profit today? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Spencer. So I think as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do believe that fuel margins will be sustained at a higher level than the historical averages. We think there's been some structural changes in that industry as you look at the last 5 years that would cause us to think that margins will be maintained at a higher level than historical levels. All that being said though, we do think -- I think I mentioned it in one of the questions earlier that we would think that fuel profitability somewhere between $200 million to $250 million headwind in 2023, largely not because we don't think that there's a continued sort of sustainability in fuel margins. But if you remember last year, when the war in Ukraine was announced, there were some real volatility in prices. And we think some of those shocks that happened around those times generally don't get repeated and cycle. So it's really allowing some of those sort of onetime unusual spikes in pricing or changes in pricing. But fundamentally, we believe fuel will be sustained at high levels. 
W. McMullen: The other thing just to add to Gary's point. When retail fuel prices are high, customers engage in our fuel rewards a lot more and we provide significant discounts to customers through our fuel rewards. If prices come down, usually our reward costs will go down there as well. So you have to look at all the pieces together. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Leah Jordan: This is Leah Jordan. You called out sourcing again as a tailwind this quarter. How are you managing that differently today? How much of an opportunity do you still see there? And is there anything assumed within the cost savings guidance as well? 
W. McMullen: I'll let Gary get into the details. But in sourcing, it's an area where several years ago, we really didn't have a separate department and didn't have professionals that manage that organization. And a couple of leaders and now reports to Gary, they've done a great job of finding talent that understands how to source product, understands the cost of the ingredients and all the pieces. And it's really turned it into a professional organization, and it's under the leadership of Mike Donnelly and Erin Sharp and a few people that have retired and now it's under Gary's leadership. And I just think that team has done a great job of bringing professionalism to the area. In terms of the specifics, now I'll let Gary get into the details. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, [ Kate ]. Yes, we certainly believe that we -- it's a bit like our overall approach to taking cost out of the business. We started out saying, how do we make sure we're as efficient as we can be and then really become, I think, part of the culture and part of the capability in the organization and the team is working together, I'd say it's across merchandising, operations, supply chain and sourcing, all kind of collaborating on how do we design for value. 
 So whether that be, as Rodney mentioned, continuing to make sure we understand the cost that makes the product and build the product and get the product to our stores in a way that we're able to make sure we're being dynamic in negotiating and managing those costs effectively where they change, but it's also about optimizing product design. It's looking at product end-to-end and improving, whether it's packaging or product design and optimizing with customer demand alongside how we can then really match the customer expectations with how we're actually designing the products to really drive the maximum value. And I'd say a bit like the productivity savings, one of those things where every year, we see a road map to additional savings, additional opportunities. And I think that will continue to be the case based on our experience so far. 
Leah Jordan: Great. And I have one quick follow-up on SNAP. Just giving any -- the potential changes there. How did you think about that with your guidance. And also, given you have such a diverse footprint, is there any color you could provide on the stores where states they've already had that extra allotment roll off? 
W. McMullen: If you look at SNAP, we've assumed that it's a meaningful headwind for the balance of the year. We're hopeful that everybody will work together to continue or find additional money because, as you know, because of inflation, there's a lot of people whose budget is under strain, but we have assumed that, that was a meaningful headwind both in the quarter and for the balance of the year. 
 I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: No, I think it ties to the point about there is still uncertainty, so we're making sure that we're allowing for that in our guidance for the year. I would say historically, and you probably or say this before that it's actually very difficult to find a correlation between SNAP in the market and spend on food at home because typically, it tends to impact more discretionary spend. But I think our view was that we've never really had a point in time where we've had so much SNAP dollars in the market. So we believe most of the models that we've looked at for the last 30 years are kind of difficult to say, well, they hold true in this environment. So we felt it was important to be conservative given that we are in a unique time. 
Operator: Our final question for today comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Kelly Bania: Rodney and Gary. I wanted to ask just about what your guidance assumes regarding the broader promotional environment. And I guess particularly thinking about the back half when maybe inflation is at a little bit of a lower level, do you expect competition and promotional activity to heat up? This seems to be one of the key investor concerns as we head into next year. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kelly. I think from our perspective, we feel that we have to be agile, and we're certainly shooting in our guidance that we'll be continuing to invest in value for the customer. I think one of the things that we believe has changed somewhat during the COVID environment is the situation of how the customer shops and engages with you is different. And what I mean by that is many more customers are engaged digitally, which gives us the ability to truly be able to personalize and bring together all the different pieces. So it's less about just what you see when you enter the store, it's about the fuel rewards that we can target for that customer. It's the personalized digital coupons. 
 It's the Our Brands offers that, as Rodney mentioned earlier, can save the customer 10% on an equivalent basket if they decide to shift to some of those products. So we believe we've learned a lot through the pandemic of how do you really channel those dollars in the most effective way, and that's what gives us the confidence that as we think about the rest of the year. We'll continue to invest in value for the customer, but that we can do that even more effectively than the past to make sure that we stretch those dollars further to deliver value for our customers. 
W. McMullen: And one of the things that I think is always important to make sure a lot customers also decide where to shop based on how the freshness of product and the friendliness of associates, and that's part of the overall value equation. So when you look at how we go to market, we have personalized offers, we have promotions, we have fuel rewards. And the customer will engage in those to manage their budget and then they win by having incredibly fresh product and incredibly friendly associates. And that's how somebody decides where to shop. So I really think it's important for you to look at all those together. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. Great. And just to follow up on the discussion of units and inflation. I think as we look at this year comps, 5% to 6% range with inflation, I believe, in the double-digit range. So maybe would imply units or tonnage down high single digit. And for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% maybe seems to assume a pretty meaningful acceleration in units. So just maybe correct me where I'm wrong on that math? Or just help us understand what would maybe drive a better unit or tonnage backdrop for Kroger in '23? 
W. McMullen: The unit change wouldn't be as much as you said because remember also, people are switching to Our Brands and other things, where the ring per item is less, but we sell more units. So when you look at overall, and if you look overall, we also look at share and if when you look at units in total, they're declining as well. So we would expect to continue to make progress in improving our share and the flow-through of units would come from that. I don't know, Gary, anything... 
Gary Millerchip: No... 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Kelly, for the question. With that, obviously, thanks to everyone for all your questions. And as always, before we close, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. We invite our associates to come to Kroger for a job and discover a career. And I can't think of a better example of this than an associate at our Cincinnati, Dayton division, [indiscernible] came to the United States from Togo. After a few weeks as a bagger, his store manager, Brian asked him if he'd be interested in leading the dairy department in his store. Because of the dedication, determination and great job that he's done, [indiscernible] is now the center store specialist, and I can't wait to see what's next for this amazing young man. 
 I'm inspired every day by the amazing work each of you do and could not be more humbled to be part of this world-class team as we enter the next year. Thank you for making Kroger the incredible place that it is. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. That concludes today's call. 
Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2022-12-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Kroger Co. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nadia, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. 
 The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary.
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. powered by our strategy of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. Our associates continue to create a seamless customer experience, delivering fresh and affordable food anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience.
 Our associates' incredible dedication means we have momentum entering the fourth quarter and we are continuing to consistently deliver a full fresh and friendly experience for our customers throughout the busy holiday season. It is clear that inflation remains top of mind for our customers and for our company. We are laser focused on helping our customers by providing fresh and affordable food.
 Research shows cooking at home is still 3x to 4x less expensive than dining out. And we are seeing more customers engage with our brands as a way to stretch their food budgets without compromising on quality. During the quarter, we continue to see many of the same shopping trends we observed throughout the year.
 In addition to higher engagement with our brands products, Customers are downloading and redeeming digital coupons and continuing to showcase their cooking at home skills learned during the pandemic. Our breadth of choices, quality of fresh products and the value of our personalized promotions are helping customers navigate the current environment, and our customer-focused approach is working.
 We continue to see overall household growth and significant loyal household growth, which drives a meaningful portion of our sales volume. We are proud to serve as America's grocer, especially during the holiday season. As friends and family come together, we look forward to providing our customers the perfect ingredients to create cherished memories. At a time when 48% of customers have told us they plan to cut back on their Thanksgiving celebration due to inflation. We took action and made sure Thanksgiving was enjoyable and memorable for everyone. To do that, we introduced an easy guide for customers to build an affordable meal of our brand's products with all of the Thanksgiving favorites that a family could enjoy for as little as $5 a person. This is just one example of how we create amazing quality at a great price when it matters most to our customers.
 We empower our customers to create lasting food memories by consistently executing against our go-to-market strategy, focused on Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and our seamless ecosystem. Fresh remains important in today's environment, and we are committed to bringing the freshest products to our customers' tables. Our Fresh for Everyone strategy is grounded in keeping products fresher, longer. Our end-to-end Fresh initiative is transforming these efforts. At the end of quarter 3, we have a total of 1,252 certified stores. At these locations, we see higher fresh sales and identical store sales. With these impressive results, we continue to roll out the initiative nationwide. As part of our end-to-end fresh initiative is our supply chain, where we continue to invest and enhance operations. We are improving productivity and maximizing our fleet by controlling more product movement across our network. Most importantly, we are using our data and science to maximize freshness for our customers.
 Beyond our end-to-end Fresh program, we are bringing more Fresh products to our customers. During the quarter, Home Chef launched new plant-based ready-to-cook meals. They also collaborated with Kroger's in-house dieticians to launch our new simple and nutritious healthy meal kits. Home Chef continues to be an exceptional example of how Kroger's history of mergers help bring new and exciting capabilities to meet our customers' changing needs across the country.
 Turning to Our Brands. We delivered another strong quarter in Our Brands with identical sales growth that outpaced overall identical sales. This was led by our Kroger and Private Selection brands. Customers continue to engage with the Our Brands portfolio, which offers high-quality products at affordable prices. Our Brands products are loved by every member of the family, including the pets. This quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our pet food brands as families continue to treat their dogs and their cats. As you know, they're like a member of the family. We continue to expand and diversify Our Brands portfolio at every price point. After launching Smart Way as our opening price point brand last quarter, we introduced several new Smart Way products this quarter and plan to roll out additional products next quarter. These products are meeting the needs of our customers on a budget, and we've already seen 2 million households to purchase Smart Way products.
 In regard to personalization, our customers are looking for opportunities to save on the products they love. Our loyalty programs and personalized promotions allow them to do just that. We continue to use our leading data science capabilities to develop unique customer insights and offer targeted promotions on the products we know they love. This strategy is driving digital engagement with digital coupon downloads, 32% higher than last year. We anticipate these interactions will continue through the holidays with customers expected to realize more than $200 million in savings from our highly personalized digital offers.
 Moving on to Seamless. We're improving our Seamless experience that brings our customers fresh products anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. We saw back-to-back quarters of strong digital growth led by our delivery solutions. This quarter, we introduced app enhancements that make it easier for customers to engage with our savings and promotion. We launched our first in-app flash sales and enabled our customers to clip digital offers directly from their cart.
 Improving the customer experience is always top of mind for us, and Kroger Pickup now offers 3-hour pickup lead times at all stores in our network, with as little as 1 hour lead time in some areas. We're investing in digital growth initiatives, including expanding our Kroger delivery network in new and existing geographies. We are also growing Boost, our one-of-the-kind membership program. This is the industry's most affordable membership program, and it is foundational to growing our delivery service. We are incredibly pleased with our customer response to Boost as we rolled out the program nationwide earlier this year.
 We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy. In addition to investing in average hourly rates this quarter, we enhanced the benefits available to our associates. We expanded the eligibility for our 401(k) plan participants to encourage earlier commitments to lifelong savings, and we took steps to continue supporting working parents by increasing family lead time and our company-sponsored benefit plans. We are excited to celebrate amazing associates this quarter, who were recognized for their outstanding work and commitment to our customers. We were the most recognized employer for Progressive Grocer's GenNext honorees, with 28 of our young leaders recognized for driving change and innovation, both within the organizations and communities they serve.
 Additionally, our KEPASA Hispanic and Latino Associate Resource Group was honored by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the Employee Resource Group of the Year.
 In summary, we are building momentum as we close out the year. We are excited to surprise and delight our customers this holiday season with high-quality fresh products at affordable prices. allowing customers to serve on the items that matter most.
 And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to cover our financial results. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on delivering value for our customers was the foundation of our strong results in quarter 3. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy is resonating the shoppers and driving increased customer loyalty. We were especially pleased with the balance achieved in our results this quarter as we continue to invest in our customers and associates, while also effectively managing costs to achieve solid earnings growth.
 These results provide yet another proof point of the strength of our value creation model and our ability to operate successfully in different environments.
 I'll now provide additional color on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.88 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by top line revenue and our disciplined approach to balancing investments with effective cost management.
 Identical sales without fuel grew 6.9%. Our Brands continue to resonate deeply with customers as sales grew 10.4%. The outstanding quality and value offered by these exclusive Kroger products is an important differentiator in our go-to-market strategy, and this is especially true during periods of high inflation. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, Our Brands products are margin accretive and represent a key pillar in our strategy to grow profitability while also delivering greater value for customers.
 Digital sales grew 10% during the quarter with delivery solutions leading the way, up 34% year-over-year. Delivery solutions includes the Kroger delivery network powered by Ocado delivery from our stores via Kroger and third-party platforms and our convenience offering, Kroger Delivery Now. Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores in Kroger Delivery are driving new customer engagement and best-in-class retention rates.
 Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 5 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our team's ability to effectively manage higher product cost inflation and shrink through strong sourcing practices while also helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.
 During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $152 million compared to $93 million in the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation in grocery. We still expect to see some moderation in inflation during our fourth quarter as we cycle higher inflation from a year ago.
 Kroger's operating general and administrative rates decreased 3 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. The decrease in OG&A rate was driven by sales leverage and execution of cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by investments in our associates. We continue to identify opportunities to remove cost from our business without affecting the customer experience and are on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.
 Kroger Health had another successful quarter, delivering higher-than-expected sales and profitability despite cycling the impact of higher COVID vaccine revenue from a year ago. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in health care, and our Kroger Health team remains committed to ensuring our customers obtain medically necessary prescriptions.
 Recently, we announced that we are terminating our Express Scripts agreement for commercial customers as of December 31. The Express Scripts contract would have required Kroger to fill our customers' prescriptions below our cost of operation, something we could not accept as we aim to keep our prices low for customers during this inflationary period. We expect this contract termination will reduce sales by about $100 million in Kroger's fiscal fourth quarter, impacting identical sales without fuel for the quarter by approximately 35 basis points. This decision is not expected to have an impact on operating profit or EPS.
 Included in our results for the quarter is an $85 million pretax charge related to the settlement of all opioid litigation claims with the State of New Mexico. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and we will continue to vigorously defend against other claims and lawsuits related to opioids.
 This settlement is based on a unique set of circumstances and facts related to New Mexico, and Kroger does not believe that the settlement amount or any other terms of our agreement with New Mexico can or should be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases pending against Kroger. It is our view that this settlement is not a reliable proxy for the outcome of any other cases or the overall level of Kroger's exposure.
 Currently, Kroger has 2 active matters pending in West Virginia and Texas scheduled for trial in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Kroger continues to believe that the claims are without merit, and that it has strong defenses to these claims. Kroger is also differently situated from many of the other defendants in these cases. Our pharmacy operations have a much smaller footprint, both in terms of the size of the business, and market share with respect to opioids, and we are proud of the outstanding work performed by our associates in delivering critical care and services to our pharmacy customers.
 Turning now to alternative profit businesses, which are a fast-growing and key part of our value creation model. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continues to create a flywheel effect for alternative profits and growth this quarter was again led by retail media. CPG brands are finding significant value in our unique ability to build custom audiences that draw on our data to deliver precisely measured return on investment.
 Last month, KPM added a new channel to its suite of retail media solutions, welcoming Snapchat into the portfolio. Advertisers are now able to use Kroger's proprietary capabilities to optimize Snapchat's immersive ad formats. We are constantly innovating to expand our reach, and KPM recently increased its programmatic advertising marketplace capabilities to include video and one of the fastest-growing digital media sectors, connected TV. These new frontiers will provide exciting future growth opportunities for KPN.
 Fuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program remains a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars during a period of high inflation. Fuel rewards engagement remained high during the third quarter and led to gallon sales, which outpaced the market. The average retail fuel price was $3.84 this quarter, versus $3.24 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.50 compared to $0.42 in the same quarter in 2021.
 The results we reported today would not have been possible without our incredible associates who continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for our customers. We have a long track record of investing in our associates and are committed to continuing these investments to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. Building on $1.2 billion of incremental investments since 2018 we have raised our average hourly rates by over 5% so far in 2022.
 During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Chicago, Fort Wayne and pharmacists in Southern California, covering more than 28,000 associates. During the fourth quarter, we have also ratified new labor agreements for associates in Toledo and Nashville, as well as the Teamsters master agreement.
 Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. During the quarter, cash flow was affected by increased inventory balances. This was predominantly due to higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery, in stocks improving to pre-pandemic levels and forward buying of inventory in pharmacy. We are comfortable that our current level and mix of inventory is appropriate to support our future sales expectations and would expect to see an improvement in working capital during the fourth quarter.
 Regarding capital expenditures, we are committed to investing in the business to support our go-to-market strategy and continue to see many opportunities to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints, and we now expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2022.
 The net effect of higher inventory and lower capital expenditures for the year is that we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2022. 
 In closing, I'd like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy continues to build momentum in our business and gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 5.1% to 5.3%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.15, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2021.
 This guidance assumes a LIFO charge of approximately $500 million for the full year, which represents a $300 million headwind over the 2021 LIFO charge. Our third quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength of Kroger's value creation model, which has proven to be resilient in different operating environments. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, and we look forward to sharing detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in March.
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. The results we've shared with you today are a testament to our business model strength and agility to support our customers in all economic environments. This is made possible because of the hard work and dedication of our incredible associates. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons. As you may know, I had the opportunity and Vivek did as well to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights this week. I shared with the senators that our merger will lower prices for customers starting day 1, continued investments in our associates and stores and customer experience and do even more in our communities than either company can do alone. We believe this merger will allow us to fulfill these commitments to our customers, our associates and our communities well into the future.
 We are making early progress on our integration planning as expected and we continue to engage with all of our stakeholders and regulators. We are advancing our road map to close the transaction in early 2024. We look forward to working with the regulators as they review the transaction and do not have a substantial update at this time. We would ask that you focus your questions on our quarterly performance and our progress on our strategy.
 With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question today go to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. 
Michael Montani: Just wanted to follow up on 2 fronts. One was into the fourth quarter guide, it appears that ID sales could be up around 4%. I just wanted to understand the deceleration there. Was that predominantly inflation and/or the Express Scripts? Or is there anything else to note? Can you share any start to the quarter information? And then I had a follow-up. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary finish it. Part of it is just cycling inflation from a year ago. We are beginning to now cycle the higher inflation a year ago. Gary, with that, I'll let you get into a little bit more asset specific. 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney. And maybe just to confirm, so the trend in the early part of the fourth quarter has continued consistent with how we're performing in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, is continued consistent with outperformance in the third quarter. Michael, as to one part of your question there. 
 I think the other piece is, Michael, yes, I think you captured them well is, as Rodney mentioned, we do believe this recycle higher inflation in the final quarter of 2021. We expect that to have some impact on the overall year-over-year growth in food at home during the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll all see how that plays out.
 And then secondly, we have factored in the impact of the ESI, the Express Scripts contract termination as well for January. So overall, I think if you kind of take our full year guidance, we'd be guiding between 4% and 5% IDs for the final quarter of the year. 
Michael Montani: Got it. And then just a follow-up on the margin implications. It looks like those could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. So I just want to understand how do you see the competitive environment evolving? And then any cost initiatives that you could share with us there? 
W. McMullen: Relative to the competitive environment, we continue to see it pretty similar to how it's been throughout the year. all retailers are doing everything they can to minimize the impact on inflation to customers the best you can do. And we obviously would use our personalized and promotions that are directly focused on individual households because of things we know they love to try to help people stretch their budget. We're also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing customers continuing to move to our brands. And in the past, what we find is when customers move to Our Brands, that's very, very sticky because the high quality of the product and the satisfaction there. So what we find is even when things are getting normalized, Our Brands come out of that at a higher penetration level than going in, which is long term good for our business as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you get into. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of bits of extra color, Michael, on the fourth quarter for you. As you probably gathered from the guidance, it would be a lowest quarter for year-over-year growth in what we shared for EPS. I think a few things to bear in mind there. First of all, we'll be cycling the strongest quarter from last year. Last year's EPS growth in Q4 '21 was the highest growth that we had during the year. So we're cycling higher growth from prior year. We'd assume fuel margins will be flat during the fourth quarter. So no real headwind or tailwind there, where, as you know, fuel has been a tailwind for us in the last couple of quarters.
 And of course, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, year-over-year, LIFO will be around $100 million headwind in the fourth quarter of EPS because you may recall again that LIFO was only $20 million last fourth quarter. when we finalize the calculations. So that would be factors to bear in mind when you think about our EPS guidance. The only other thing I might mention is that you've heard me talk about on this call in previous quarters that when you look at our rolling 4 quarter sort of gross margin investment, somewhere between 10 and 20 basis points and OG&A leverage of 10, 20 basis points similarly to keep the business in balance. I would say that because we're cycling Q4 last year gross margin was relatively flat, and OG&A was relatively flat. So I would say you should probably expect our gross margin investment will be a little bit north of the 10 to 20 basis points in Q4, but our OG&A leverage should also be north of that 10 to 20 basis points as well. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Nice quarter. If you could talk a little bit about which categories did worse than inflation in terms of unit growth in which we're stronger on managing a lot of that was in the general merchandise. And also, Gary, could you comment on why identical sales growth, ex fuel was better than total sales growth ex-fuel? 
W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of the categories, the one you identified definitely would be the weaker category in terms of general merchandise. And that would be true at the Fred Meyer division, it would also be true across the rest of the organization as well. We continue to do well in those categories relative to the market. Our teams have done a great job of making sure they've been managing inventories relative to where the expectations themselves.
 The other categories that would be weaker than the total would be categories where we continue to have supply chain disruptions. Gary and I both mentioned, overall supply chain is getting better, but we still have categories like cat food, dog food, baby formula some of those types of cold remedies, some of those areas continue to have some supply chain issues as well. With the identicals, Gary, go on. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Yes, the biggest part of that, in fact, pretty much all of it, Chuck, would be -- you may recall at the start of the year, we shared that we've made the decision to stop dispensing certain drugs in our specialty pharmacy business because it didn't really tie to overall customer loyalty in our broader business, and it isn't profitable business for us. So we made that decision at the start of the year, and we adjust that out of our ID. So it's a like-for-like comparison, but it does create a disconnect between total sales and identical sales.
 One of those examples is actually helping gross margin as well as we're making those decisions to make sure we're optimizing the balance of the business. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Gary, I'd like to ask you about the dynamic between the LIFO charge and the FIFO gross margin going forward. There's -- the FIFO gross margin have been good. And this year, there's probably $0.50 a share or more, I guess, in the LIFO charge in terms of the headwind. I mean assuming inflation eases, you get much of that LIFO charge back.
 Do we just add that back to earnings? Or is there a dynamic to consider when we think about the FIFO gross margin? Presumably, some of this probably still needs to be priced. I'm just kind of curious, is the FIFO gross margin performance that we've seen, can you sustain that when the LIFO charge eases next year? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think as you heard as mentioned on the call, we probably won't get into a lot of detail around 2023 guidance because we'd rather put it into context of the full picture for next year. As you might imagine, there'll be a lot of moving parts as we sort of bridge to share that color with you when we get to March next year.
 I think overall, though, certainly, some of the elements that you talked about are going to be key factors when you think about what will be at play as you think about 2023, if I kind of talk more in general themes. I think overall, I would say we feel good to answer your question about gross margin that we are very focused on -- and I think are proven for our model, but there are levers that we can pull to manage costs and sourcing effectively to improve mix over time with some of the momentum in our brands and the opportunities continue to accelerate fresh performance and innovation.
 So there are a number of areas when we look at the balancing gross margin that we believe we would expect there to be longer-term stability and our ability to manage that. I think when you look specifically at the moving parts for next year, I think there's going to be a lot of factors that will come into play as you think about next year.
 You're right in terms of if inflation normalizes and your numbers certainly correct around the $500 million impact this year, which would be a $300 million year-over-year headwind because last year's LIFO was also inflated as inflation started to rise in quarter 4 last year. If you remember, our LIFO charge is calculated at a very specific week of the year, even though we try and estimate it throughout the year.
 So we would believe that as we'll get into guidance next year, obviously, when we share our earnings, and we're still sort of forming views around what we think will happen with inflation, but we're probably looking at most of the external views that you are and most of the analysts' reports that we can look at in the USDA, et cetera, would be in that sort of more of that 2.5% to 3-or-so percent inflation for next year. We'll obviously provide more color on what we believe, but that's sort of where most of the data that we see tend to be pointing towards. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Fuel margins have been really strong. I mean there's been -- some of your peers in the industry have talked about that moderating next year? I'm just kind of curious as to whether you share that view and how we should be thinking about modeling that going forward? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think again, I'll maybe just broaden it because again, I think it's a little bit dangerous to pick on one element of the model for next year. I do think that fuel margins have had obviously a very good run. And generally, I think margins are improving over time, but there is -- there has been in the last 2 years, some major volatility in shocks in the market. I think it's hard to see those being cycled. So you look at margins earlier in this year, and I think that's likely to be a headwind next year in looking at the fuel profitability.
 But again, I think you mentioned LIFO, another example for us would be -- as you look at our incentive plan, obviously, we're having a very strong year versus our expectations, having raised our guidance every quarter. So you get to more of a normalized incentive plan next year, assuming the budgets kind of your expected payout.
 We continue to take costs out of our business and find new ways to improve leverage in the model. It has been 5 years, as you know, journey for us. We believe supply chain and alternative profits are potential tailwinds next year as we continue to improve efficiency in supply chain and all profit continues to grow.
 So I think there's a lot of moving parts. And again, rather than sort of trying to bridge you to how all those play out. I think that's going to be a balance of puts and takes. And obviously, we're looking forward to sharing a lot more color when we get to March next year. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I think when you look at Gary's points overall, it's one of the things that's so important about our overall business model because we do have a lot of moving parts, and we've invested a ton of work and effort our whole team has over the last several years to reinvent the business model and make sure the business model can be successful in every economic environment. And to me, Gary's point that he was sharing really highlight that as we look forward. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. 
Scott Mushkin: So the first thing I wanted to -- so the first thing I wanted to get some answers to a little bit is the market share, you guys market share. It seems to have stabilized, maybe even growing a little bit. Do you agree? And what do you think is leading to that? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share, the trends continue to improve, and we feel good about where we are, but we're not satisfied with where we are. We believe the work that we're doing on Fresh is a key part of driving that.
 And obviously, just the continued personalization and making sure that we have a customer experience for its household to household type relationship. And then Our Brands always shines when an economic environment gets a little tougher. So it's really those things working together.
 And then our store teams continuing to do a good job of improving on friendliness. And I make that comment based on what customers tell us how we're doing, not just my opinion of how we're doing. 
Scott Mushkin: Great. And then my second question is a little bit more short term. I mean we've heard some retailers, not necessarily in the food industry, but some retailers that the consumers behave or kind of changed somewhat abruptly as we work through the fall. I mean, is that something you guys have seen? And if yes, do you think it's started to leak into the competitive environment? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It's a great question, Scott. And when we talk to our customers, they're telling us they're changing. But so far, they're changing on purchases other than food. So it's -- they are still prioritizing food. It gets a little bit back to one of the comments I made. It's still 3x or 4x cheaper to eat at home versus going out to a restaurant and so many more people have learned how to cook.
 So if you look at the behavior changes other than the movement to our brands and being much more aggressive on downloading digital coupons and engaging with some of our promotional offers. That's really the only behavior we've seen in our business outside of the comment I made earlier on our general business, but that's a much smaller part of our business than many of our competitors. 
Scott Mushkin: And the competitive environment, has it changed? 
W. McMullen: No. It's all -- as you know, it's any place you look across the country, you'll see it in different stages. And -- but overall, what we see is pretty similar to what -- how it's been. 
Operator: And the next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with a big picture here. When do you guys think about -- because you've got the data, if you think about growth in households, right? So if you're going to comp, let's say, I don't know, 3% or 4% longer term, household growth would be what of that and comp growth with comp households would be what? How do you think about that? And then when you -- is there any way for you to dive into your penetration, right, with your deciles and where the biggest opportunity is? 
W. McMullen: I will start and then Gary, please add any color you want. But if you look long term, we always build our business model around 1% to 2% inflation. And if you -- as you know, any given year will be different than that. But longer term, we've always felt that, that's kind of where fundamental inflation will be. Obviously, over the last couple of years, it's been completely different than that.
 As I shared in my prepared remarks, our oil household growth was very strong this quarter, and it's been moving in the right direction. When customers first become a loyal household, what we find is, over time, we get a higher share of that household growth. And we really are seeing that what we define as our seamless experience where a customer can engage with us where we deliver, where they pick up in store and shop in store, it's that combination together that earns us the right.
 So as our loyal household grows, we get a higher share and that should be a tailwind to our identical sales growth over time. And that was the reason that we talked about it, and it's something, internally, we spend a lot of energy on it. And I know, Gary, is there any other color that you think would be helpful for people to understand. 
Gary Millerchip: I think you covered it well, Rodney. I guess the only couple of extra points, John, I would maybe add, I do think, as you know, our core strategy is to grow existing loyal customers and what was really pleasing in the quarter as we saw 2.5% growth in loyal customers. So we're seeing customers move through the loyalty curve, and that's always been carry the strategy to really deeply reward customers and grow that relationship.
 I think what we're also seeing though is that as Rodney mentioned, we're building that Seamless capability with digital, we are starting to now attract a larger number of households too and the investments we're making in digital are creating that capacity to grow households as well.
 I think the one thing on the loyal house, as I would say, too, is what we saw during the quarter have seen the last couple of quarters is that maybe that more affluent customer that has shopped maybe a larger number of retailers before that's consolidated more of their trips and total basket with Kroger as they may not need to adjust their budget because of inflation, but they feel it's the sensible and responsible thing to do, and they see Kroger as a great place to get the right quality at a great value as well, and we're seeing that consolidation happen. 
John Heinbockel: And just one more quick thing. Just conceptually, I know you don't want to talk about anything beyond this year, but right? You've raised the EBIT guide quite a bit right now you're up in the high 4s. When you look at '22, what was in there, maybe the good guys and the bad guys that kind of work against each other. I'm sort of wondering how sustainable is that new level of profitability? Again granted, the margin is not up as much as the dollars are. How do you think about that in terms of how representative of that performance is and what goes and comes next year off the P&L from this year? 
W. McMullen: John, as you know, we manage our business on dollars. And for us, growing dollars is what creates a sustainable business model long term. And we always view that the better offer that we can be able to afford to give to our customers the more sustainable that is, and the only way we can do that is by managing our costs and continuing to find and identify areas of waste so that we can reduce that and fund that.
 Fundamentally, as you look at Kroger, we still would have that same strategy and we'd still expect that over time because what we find is that really connects well with the customers. We -- that allows us the capacity to continue to invest in our associates and support our communities. And when we do those 3 things right, the shareholders benefit.
 So I know broad picture, that's what we would do, the way we look at things. And obviously, with everything we do, we try to make sure we're doing it in a way that's sustainable long periods of time. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Kenneth B. Goldman of JP Morgan Chase. 
Kenneth Goldman: It's important to list my little initial [indiscernible] I'm just curious, the -- it's the second quarter in a row that you've lowered your CapEx guidance. I understand why you've been clear about that. And as Rob Moskow pointed out last quarter, you're not the only company to feel that pressure. I'm curious though, at what point is it reasonable for us to not be concerned, but sort of be aware of the potential impact on your growth from not being able to expand in a way that you'd like. I'm just curious how it affects anything in the near term, if at all? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Ken. For us, I don't think it's really something that we're concerned about. We obviously did have very ambitious plans for CapEx this year, playing some catch-up from last year. And we still believe the projects that we have on the horizon are going to be generating significant value for the company in the future and support our growth plans.
 But when we looked at the expectations for the rest of the year, there are a number of large projects, whether it's in supply chain or some of the stores, just where it's just taking longer to get them completed or there are some costs where it just makes sense to pause for a period of time and reintroduce when we believe that those costs will be more rational.
 So from our perspective, we don't look at it as having a major impact on our growth model. As you know, we kind of historically were at sort of that $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion of CapEx spend a year. We've moved it up to $3.5 billion, being our sort of target range. And I would still say that's probably directionally where we'd want to be long term, to be pushing to the top end of our TSR model.
 So we do believe it's important to be investing in the business, and we can still see plenty of opportunities to support that growth, but we just thought it was based on how long it's taking with certain things to get projects completed with supply availability that we think it's going to be a -- some of those projects will now blend into 2023, but we don't have a concern today about it impacting our growth algorithm. 
Kenneth Goldman: Got it. And then Rodney, I very much respect your request for us not to ask about the transaction. I won't ask about it. But I am curious, is there a plan ahead to sort of have give updates to investors on a separate kind of form just because it's obviously such a big part of the story from here. I think people don't want a black hole or a vacuum of news. So I'm just curious what the plan is to kind of update investors on progress? Is it just you'll let us know during each quarter what's new and that's kind of it. And then we won't have any Q&A around that. I'm just trying to get a sense of that kind of news flow from here. 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's something that we're going to obviously manage in a very transparent way. And we wanted to go ahead and include it in this quarter, just the context of what is new, and that's what we've shared.
 If there was something material, we would share it between quarters. But in all likelihood in the foreseeable future updates would be on a quarterly basis. But if it was something material -- what we try to do on disclosure is if our roles were reversed, what is it that we think it would be helpful for someone to know, and that's what we always try to do. So -- and obviously, feel free to give us feedback when that doesn't feel right to you because we appreciate the feedback. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Rodney, why wouldn't the grocery sector being more competitive and see more price competition in 2023 given that the consumer is going to be under pressure there's going to be your competitors who are going to want to try and gain some share given the potential distraction from the uncertainty of the merger with Albertsons? Many consumable retailers will have this LIFO gross margin benefit into '23, and there's going to be disinflation where at times, it could be easier to make price investments in an environment of disinflation than it is when there is an inflation. 
W. McMullen: Yes. It really gets back to overall. I think it's incredibly important to understand that we connect with the customer in multiple ways, and Fresh is a critical component of that. We fundamentally assume over time, the market is going to get more competitive. We've done that for 25 years. We'll continue to do that. And that's the reason why we put so much investment energy on personalizing experiences, supporting our associates in ways -- any way we can, pay, continue in education, even additional support on mental health and especially in today's environment.
 And what we have found in every environment by supporting and connecting with the customer from a full fresh and friendly experience and then having good prices and very aggressive promotion and then personalizing the experience, we're able to support the customer.
 One of the things that also supports gross margin as we continue to expect larger growth in our Fresh departments, which have higher margins in center store. And then when you look at our alternative profit businesses and some of those businesses have margins better than what the center store would be. So for us, it's -- you really have to look at all of those things together and look at those things over time, and we feel really good about the business model that we continue to develop and grow at our company. 
Michael Lasser: Understood. And my follow-up question is on the outlook for inflation. What are you hearing right now from your vendor can be about their desire to raise prices into 2023. Gary, you said previously that there will be -- or some of the prognostications are for 2.5% to 3% food at home inflation next year.
 If you were to not raise another price from here, how much inflation benefit would Kroger experienced in 2023 just from the wraparound effect of what you've already raised this year? And then when you meant to 2.5% to 3%, would it be another 2.5% to 3% on top of that? 
W. McMullen: Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and Gary, you can think about some of the specifics. If you look at in our fresh departments, clearly, inflation is slowing down in many categories. Chicken would be an example. You're starting to see that in some of the other categories as well. And I always make the comment high inflation solves high inflation because farmers produce more when their margins improve.
 If you look at on CPG companies themselves, right now, it's kind of mixed. Some CPG companies are willing -- much willing to have higher prices and give up growth. And what we find is when CPGs do that, our brand is so strong, we really gained share. And that helps the customers budget and it also improves the stickiness and the loyalty of that customer as well. So it's -- what do they always say, all short statements and economics are wrong. And I really think you have to look at all the moving parts. I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to Michael's inflation? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think Michael, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that Fresh is certainly starting to see some change in trajectory on inflation. So I think it is the grocery category that's the most stubborn if you like, in terms of where it's holding in inflation at the moment. And as Rodney said, I think from -- as we look forward from our perspective, if that were to continue without being sort of supported by true cost increases, then that creates an opportunity for us with our brands to improve margin and grow share over time. So I think that's the way we think about it in general. 
Operator: And the next question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. 
Kelly Bania: Kelly Bania from BMO. Just a couple of simple questions. I guess, as we think about the comp here or the IDs in the back half, can you just help us understand how much inflation drove the upside there versus tonnage or -- you talked quite a bit about your fresh initiative. Is it those stores? Just helping us understand where the upside is coming from?
 And then on top of that, we often talk on the food service side of the industry about volume and tonnage, I guess, is the way you talk about it relative to 2019. And I'm just curious if you can help us understand where you are in terms of volume or tonnage, however you think about that relative to 2019 levels at this point? 
W. McMullen: Gary, I'll let you talk about the -- a little color on the IDs and then on the foodservice after you finish Health. I share some things there. 
Gary Millerchip: Okay. Great. Kelly, I think overall, we mentioned it in their prepared remarks somewhat as well. We've seen inflation starting to level. It's still obviously at very heightened levels. But if you look at the trend quarter-over-quarter, it really narrowed down to less than 1% increase in inflation in our Q3 versus our Q2.
 So what we were pleased about was in that context, the continued momentum in our overall ID sales when we look at our Q3 performance versus our Q2, and I think a lot of that ties to some of the prepared remarks that Rodney also shared around household growth that we're seeing and really some of the defying more share of wallet from loyal customers and seeing lower customer growth. So that's the piece that I think we've been the most pleased around.
 And we continue to perform really well with winning that first large basket with customers. We continue to see strong momentum there. And even as customers have continued to adjust their behavior as they kind of wrestle with inflation and decide how to balance budgets, we've been really pleased with how our overall pinning that first basket has continued to maintain strong momentum. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On foodservice, volume would actually be above where we would have been in 2019. For us, when we look at foodservice or food -- we are always -- I never know quite what to call it other than it's a great meal, easy to cook, easy to heat up, easy to assemble. It was the reason why strategically we merged with Home Chef because we thought Home Chef on its own had great trends and could continue to grow.
 We also felt like their capabilities we could leverage back into Kroger to further improve our mill pit and a great restaurant quality meals would be an example. If you look at sushi, we're the largest sushi restaurant in the United States as an example. Obviously, we partner with a lot of third parties and local entrepreneurs on that, sandwiches and all those things.
 So we see food service as an important component of our growth, not so much relative to 2023. But as you start looking out at, say, 2025 and beyond, and being -- having an amazing quality meal that's easy and leveraging our delivery network or pickup network is an important part of the growth as you look longer term. 
Operator: Next question is Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: I just had one question just on OG&A leverage. So this quarter, there was minimal leverage on a very strong comp, and that appears to be driven by wage pressures. So as you look forward to next year, just any insight in terms of how you guys are thinking about wage crushers at this juncture and whether you think the OG&A leverage point could be lower? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Rupesh, thanks for the question. Maybe just a little bit more color on Q3 and Q4 as well because I think there's a little bit more to the story there as well that's worth understanding. I would say that certainly, you're right, the -- we saw a lot of benefit from sales leverage and productivity improvements during the quarter.
 The team did a great job in really managing costs, considering the inflation that we're facing in some of those cost areas. We would have also had higher incentive plan costs year-over-year in quarter higher technology costs. We're investing in a number of areas that we're seeing growth in year-over-year. And some of that is maybe flipping from capital to operating expense because as you move more to cloud-based activity.
 It just -- it does change the mix there as well. And we also invested, as we did in Q2 in some consultants and some advisory work to help build future momentum in the growth. So I would say the underlying improvement in productivity was stronger than the quarter would have suggested, and we feel good about the ability to leverage OG&A and fund the average hourly rate increases that we're seeing.
 In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the Q4 number as we're cycling a fairly flat OG&A rate in Q4, we would expect to be north of 20 basis points of leverage in the fourth quarter this year as we head into next year. 
Operator: And the next question is our final question to Robert S. Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Kendall Toscano: This is Kendall Toscano on for Robbie. I just wanted to see if you could give any more color on how traffic looked during the quarter. What kind of trends you're seeing with items in the basket and number of trips to the store? And then, I guess, as you're expecting inflation to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, what you would expect on those items going forward? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the overall trends in traffic, it continues to be improving. Obviously, the overall basket itself is heavily driven by inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, our trends on market share are moving in the right direction and continue to go in the right direction. In terms of the last part, I don't know, Gary, on inflation? 
Gary Millerchip: I think probably similar to what we shared earlier, I think overall, as we're looking at the way the customer is changing behavior, as Rodney mentioned, trips improving, generally fairly consistent, I would say, over the year, but we are seeing higher trips from those loyal shoppers that have traditionally shopped in many different retailers for different categories and now seeing that trip consolidate to Kroger. I think is an important trend that we've seen throughout the year and continue to accelerate in the third quarter. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Gary, I think that's a great point, and thanks for the questions. And for everyone, thank you for joining us today. As always, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in because so many of our associates take the time to do that, which we appreciate. This is the time of year we truly shine.
 Our special holiday film made clear. We create the opportunity for our customers to transform today's holiday moments into tomorrow's memories. We've had the pleasure to hear from countless associates former associates and customers about just how touching this film has been. I know I can't watch it without getting a tear in my eye. And just reminding all of us how special it is to share favorite meals with those we love most.
 Thank you to our teams who put this together. Thank you for our teams who make the memories happen. It's a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season. As we all prepare together with our loved ones, I am so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger family of companies. We have accomplished so much this year. Thank you for the many ways you serve our communities and uplift our customers and each other. This concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2022-09-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
 The Kroger team delivered another strong performance during the quarter, fueled by our strategy Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. These consistent results underscore the resiliency and flexibility of our business model, along with our associates' passion to deliver a fresh, convenient customer experience with 0 compromise on quality, selection and affordability.  
 Customers continue to adjust their shopping habits in response to ongoing inflation. We are doing everything we can to help our customers stretch their dollars with high-quality fresh products at everyday low prices and industry-leading fuel rewards program and personalized savings on the items that matter most to them. Our customers are looking for ways to save and we are there for them.  
 During the quarter, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high with 750 million digital offers downloaded, totaling almost $1 billion in savings. Our fuel rewards program continues to resonate with customers as more than 600,000 incremental households engaged with our fuel rewards program this quarter compared to last year. And our fuel reward redemption rates were also up significantly.  
 We continue to see more customers cooking from scratch and eating out less often. Our broad assortment of products is meeting the need for customers to buy what they want on their terms. For example, some customers are continuing to buy more of their favorite fresh products like apples, tomatoes and grapes. While other customers are choosing products like frozen fruit and vegetables, allowing products to last longer in their homes. Overall, customers are looking to save money and make healthier choices by cooking more meals at home rather than eating out. Kroger's strong value proposition drove positive household growth and meaningful [indiscernible] household growth both online and in-store.  
 Digital sales also returned to positive growth, driven by our one-of-a-kind boost membership program and expansion of our Kroger delivery network. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is connecting with customers, and we continue to build long-term customer loyalty through Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and our Seamless ecosystem.  
 Leading with Fresh, we are dedicated to serving our customers the freshest products so when they think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing technology and deploying fresh innovation to deliver products faster, which stay fresher longer for our customers to enjoy. And it's working. In our 864 fresh certified stores, customers are purchasing more fresh products and overall store sales are growing faster than the rest of the business. Supply chain remains an important part of our fresh strategy as well. In order to maximize freshness, we are utilizing our data science and collaborating with our partners to minimize [ dwell ] time in our distribution network and maintain the integrity of the cold chain. We are also improving productivity in our supply chain. 
 During the quarter, we reduced fuel cost headwinds through technology and process efficiencies, such as controlling more product movement across the value chain and maximizing our trucking capacity. While some categories remain challenging, supplier in-stocks are improving, and we are cautiously optimistic this will continue in the back half of the year.  
 Turning to Our Brands. We saw incredible engagement in Our Brands during the quarter with identical sales growth of 10.2% compared to last year. This increase was led by our Kroger and Home Chef brands. Convenience remains a priority and Home Chef is meeting that need by providing high-quality family meals as a budget-friendly alternative to eating out at restaurants.  
 For other customers who are enjoying cooking from scratch, Our Brands are delivering innovative products at a great value. So Our Brands' product strategy is rooted in quality, providing customers with memorable meal experiences they crave. And these products continue to earn world-class recognition. Most recently, Murray's Cheese varieties won five awards at the highly regarded 2022 American Cheese Society Competition. We were also recognized by Store Brands Magazine with 12 Editors' Picks awards for best new products, the most of any retailer. This recognition focused specifically on food that met customer needs for healthier products.  
 As we continue to look for ways to help our customers stretch their budgets, this quarter, we launched a new portfolio strategy for our opening price point brands. We consolidated 17 legacy brands into 2. Heritage Farm for our fresh and dairy product lines; and our newest brand, Smart Way for our nonperishable items. These brands are competitively priced and meet the needs of customers on a [indiscernible] budget. We launched with 150 SKUs and expect to roll out additional products by the end of the year.  
 Now moving to digital. We achieved positive sales growth, as I mentioned before, led by our strong delivery results. Early in the second quarter, we introduced our Boost membership nationwide, and it's already showing promising results including an increase in overall household spend among members. We remain focused on adding new members and are encouraged that enrollment is in line with our internal expectations and projections.  
 During the quarter, we opened a new Customer Fulfillment Center powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform in Romulus, Michigan. Additionally, we are excited to expand the Kroger delivery network to more customers in four new geographies during the quarter through spoke facilities in Austin, Birmingham, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. This brings our total CFC and spoke count to 18.  
 We also continue to invest in our pickup business, where demand remains strong. During the quarter, we increased capacity and shortened wait times to improve our customer experience. We also invested in technology and implemented process efficiencies, which helped lower our cost to serve.  
 Our customers are telling us they love our Seamless experience. We continue to see customers effortlessly shift between store, pickup and delivery, which is building loyalty. We continue to improve the experience. And we'll always encourage our customers to shop with us how they want to and with 0 compromises.  
 Our associate dedication and passion continue to fuel Kroger's consistently strong results, and we are proud to invest in our teams and improve the associate experience. We saw more people apply to work at Kroger this quarter as we continue to attract talented associates.  
 Our current associates, we are making progress on retention. We've rolled out improved onboarding guidelines and implemented career planning tools. In addition, as part of our commitment to associate wellness, we recently introduced a new financial coaching service tool for hourly associates. This unique benefit offers free financial planning assistance to our associates. We are launching the tool in three pilot divisions and look forward to expanding the service across the company by January of 2023.  
 It is always exciting to see our associates' commitment to creating an outstanding work environment recognized. For the third consecutive year, Kroger was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equity Index. Additionally, the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm, honored Kroger for our training programs and the ways in which our teams promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Each team member is involved in creating our culture where associates come for a job and discover a career.  
 Our Purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit inspires our team every day. One important way we bring our purpose to life is through Kroger's comprehensive ESG strategy. Our aim is to achieve lasting positive change for people and our planet. Our newly published 2022 ESG report called Nurturing Shared Values, outlines the entire Kroger family strong progress against dozens of environmental sustainability, social impact and governance goals and commitments.  
 We continued working to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business. Nowhere is this more evident than through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This month marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. And while we still have much -- so much more work to do to achieve our moonshot goal of achieving a world free from hunger and food waste, we also have so much to celebrate. Over the past 5 years, our team donated 2.3 billion meals to our neighbors in need, which included $1 billion in giving to fight food and security, 500 million pounds of surplus food donated to our food bank partners and nearly $45 million in grants to support food recovery and system change from our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. And I'm very proud to share for the first time ever, our store teams achieved 100% execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue, which is the strongest proof point yet of the value of operationalizing ESG. It took all of our teams working cross-functionally to achieve this important milestone. A huge congratulations and thank you to all involved.  
 In summary, Kroger delivered another strong second quarter. We continue to delight our customers, strengthen our business model and execute on our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. We remain focused on delivering for our associates, customers and communities. And when we do that well, deliver value for our shareholders.  
 With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our second quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. 
 The Kroger team is laser-focused on executing our go-to-market strategy, which we outlined at our Investor Day in March. Our balanced business model has proven to be resilient in a variety of operating and economic environments, and our second quarter performance provided another proof point of this as we delivered significant year-over-year growth.
 I'll now provide additional color on our second quarter results. We achieved strong identical sales growth without fuel of 5.8% and saw momentum build throughout the quarter. Our Brands led the way with identical sales growing 10.2%. We believe the unmatched combination of innovation, quality and value provided by Our Brands is a clear competitive advantage as inflation remains front of mind for many of our customers.  
 Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year and ahead of our internal expectations. These results were driven by increased sales of our fuel, disciplined margin management and strong fuel profitability.  
 Our seamless digital ecosystem is critical to building deeper customer loyalty and accelerating market share growth. During the quarter, digital sales grew 8%, led by strength in delivery solutions, which grew by 34%. We continue to invest in digital growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Kroger Delivery network in new and existing geographies, investments in the customer value proposition via Kroger Boost membership and the expansion of customer trip missions, including meal solutions and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our positive momentum in digital sales will continue in the second half of the year.  
 Kroger Health also contributed meaningfully to our second quarter results as we grew the profitability of our core pharmacy business. This allowed us to cycle the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine revenue from a year ago, which is especially impressive given the number of [ vaccinations ] administered last year.  
 Gross margin was 20.9% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost inflation through strong sourcing practices while helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive.  
 Our team is doing an outstanding job navigating the current inflationary environment. We are experiencing the benefits of a multiyear journey in enterprise sourcing that is delivering significant and sustainable savings for Kroger and our customers. Our personalized pricing strategy is enabling us to maximize the reach and effectiveness of our promotional investments to drive loyalty and deliver value for our customers in ways they value most. Together, this has enabled Kroger to improve our price position relative to our key competitors.  
 Due to continued heightened levels of product cost inflation, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $148 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. We expect inflation will remain at heightened levels in the second half of the year but moderate on a year-over-year basis as we start to cycle the higher inflation, which began in the third quarter last year.  
 Kroger's OG&A rate increased 36 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in associates, higher incentive plan costs and strategic investments in various margin expansion initiatives, partly offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost savings.  
 We continue to identify opportunities to remove costs from our business without affecting the customer experience and they're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.  
 As I mentioned a moment ago, the increase in our OG&A rate during the quarter was unusual as it included an accrual catch-up for higher projected incentive costs covering the first half of the year, as well as strategic investments in a number of margin expansion initiatives that will drive future growth. We would expect to achieve year-over-year improvements in our OG&A rate in the second half of the year and for the full year.  
 Turning now to alternative profits. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to increase its relevance with our CPG partners. During the quarter, we saw an increase in brand reinvestment rates as CPGs experienced strong returns on their marketing spend with KPM. Kroger Personal Finance products and services are also connecting well with customers in the current environment, providing even more ways to save. This includes our KPF credit card featuring an introductory $0.55 off per gallon of fuel and our gift card program, which promotionally offers 4x fuel rewards.  
 Fuel remains an important part of our business model and delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our fuel rewards program is a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers engage with our fuel rewards program at the highest rate since the start of the pandemic during the second quarter, and this helped to ensure our gallon sales outpace the market.  
 The average retail fuel price was $4.62 this quarter compared to $3.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.62 compared to $0.39 in the same quarter in 2021. The strength of our fuel results is a great example of the flexibility that exists within our business model as higher fuel profit fully offset the higher LIFO charge in the quarter and allowed us to reinvest strategically in a number of margin expansion initiatives.  
 Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers, and we are investing in hourly wages to ensure Kroger remains an employee of choice. We're also committed to continuing to invest in our associates and sustainably growing hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our long-term financial model.  
 During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Houston, Memphis, Lake Charles, Shreveport, Las Vegas Clarkson and Meat, Southern California [ Clarkson Meats ] and Indianapolis, covering more than 40,000 associates. In the second half, we plan to complete contract negotiations for Chicago, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Toledo, South Bend and Southern California pharmacists.  
 Turning now to our financial strategy and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. As a result of our operating performance and working capital improvements over recent years, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Underlying initiatives to improve working capital also helped offset higher inventory balances during the quarter, which were a function of higher product cost inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
 We continue to prioritize capital investments that support our go-to-market strategy and see many opportunities to drive future growth. As we updated in our guidance today, we now expect our range for capital investments for 2022 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion as various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints. 
 Earlier this quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 24%, reflecting our confidence in our long-range plans and our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow. The quarterly dividend has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006. And this marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases.  
 During the quarter, we also repurchased $309 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $975 million of shares. Earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.  
 I'd now like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution in our go-to-market strategy is building momentum in our business, which combined with sustained food-at-home trends gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 4% to 4.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.05, representing growth of 7% to 10% over 2021. This outlook includes a year-over-year headwind from LIFO of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2022.  
 In closing, we have the right go-to-market strategy and are operating from a position of strength. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. 
 The Kroger team successfully navigated another quarter in a dynamic operating environment with strong results. As our customers continue to deal with high inflation, our value proposition is resonating with them. And this reflects the balance we've built into our model. We have demonstrated the ability to offer customers fresh, affordable food and the value they need to help them manage their budgets while we continue to invest in our associates, reinvest in our business and consistently generate strong results. Our performance gives us the confidence that we have the right plan in place to build on our momentum and continue delivering value for all stakeholders.  
 So with that, Alex, we'll turn it over for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. 
John Heinbockel: I want to start a little quick with the improvement you saw in IDs, can you break that out into traffic and ticket? And then maybe within ticket, right, AUR versus items per basket? And is -- I know nonfood has been a big drag. Is that still a drag? Did that get better at all? 
W. McMullen: I'll start on that and let Gary add some more of the details. The biggest part of the drive in improving trends is continued improvement in our loyal household growth and total household of people coming to our stores. We continue to see average transaction size smaller as people come into the store more often and more frequent. We would continue with some headwinds from the nonfood products as well. 
 Gary, any additional insights you want to provide? 
Gary Millerchip: I think you covered most of it, Rodney. As Rodney mentioned, John, we're certainly seeing for our most low shoppers continuing to win that first basket, and we're definitely seeing, as we look at our trends, that's holding up very well compared to what we're seeing overall within the market. And for our most loyal customers, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that number grow overall and trips also growing with our customer that most loyal shoppers starting to increase the number of trips into the store as well. So I think they are the key points that I would call out. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The only other thing that might be helpful insight, John, is it's pretty consistent across the country as well. 
John Heinbockel: Real quick follow-up then, right? Your nonfuel gross is the best we've seen, or one of the best we've seen in a while despite the inflation. So maybe is that mix -- role of mix versus -- I'm curious if there's a lot of forward bought product that you're benefiting from? Or is that still hard to get? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, one of the things that our teams have done a nice job is on procurement. The other piece would be, as you mentioned, mix. The fresh departments continue to help on mix. And we continue to see a lot of customers continue to add value-added products as well. 
 I don't know Gary, any additional comments? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, I think you picked up the biggest drivers with sourcing and the benefits. It's not so much forward buying but continuing to be really disciplined, John, with how we look at the designer product and how we're managing relationships with our supply partners as well. 
 One of the areas I would say, specifically in that, that was a tailwind this quarter versus last quarter is the sourcing team and supply chains working really well together to offset the pressure on fuel costs and making sure that we're improving efficiency in the supply chain and operating at optimum levels to really offset that. And naturally, whereas in the last couple of quarters, supply chain would have been a headwind to gross margin, it was essentially flat this quarter. And that wasn't because fuel costs were not a headwind year-over-year. It was really how we applied our approach to the challenge across sourcing the supply chain to make our operation more efficient. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. 
Kelly Bania: Just wanted -- if you could help us understand how fuel is impacting that. I think your prior plan was for a $50 million headwind. I think you just talked about LIFO, which sounds like is going to be about $150 million higher for the year. Just trying to think about those puts and takes as it relates to kind of the core flow-through of the higher [ IEs ] and how that impacts the back half? 
W. McMullen: Gary, go ahead. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, absolutely. Kelly, thanks for the question. Yes, I think you've actually picked on many of the key points. We would be expecting many of the levers that we've been pulling in managing to grow sales and grow customer loyalty and manage the margin performance in the business will be consistent in the back half of the year. The key elements that we called out are what would optically make our EPS growth look less meaningful in the second half. 
 First of all, as you mentioned, our total LIFO charge for the year is about a $250 million headwind for the whole year, which translates to about $100 million, so about $0.10 of EPS impact in the back half of the year. 
 On fuel, we haven't changed our view. [ Fuel's ] been very difficult to predict, and we don't want to kind of rely on potential upside in fuel when it really isn't something that we -- while the team does a great job of managing the best in the conditions, we don't lead, obviously, on fuel pricing. Our reward program, which really what drives our strategy in fuel. So we're assuming, as we cycle $0.43 to $0.44 of CPG profit from the back half of last year, but if fuel rates more sort of return to normalized levels, then that would be a $50 million to $60 million headwind in the back half of the year. 
 So there's about $0.16 of EPS headwinds that we have built in today for LIFO. Were it not for those two, then essentially our EPS would be sort of in the 6% to 8% growth range very much in line with our TSR. So we do still expect the underlying profitability of our supermarket business to improve in the back half of the year as we exclude LIFO and fuel. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. And Gary mentioned one of these in his prepared remarks, but the organization still has incredibly strong cost control, and this will be the fifth year in a row that we've been able to get over $1 billion of cost out. Obviously, that's an important part of that. And we do expect alternative profit to continue to be a little strong, a little bit stronger in the second half of the year as the first half of the year as well. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up with digital. So growth of 8%. I think that brings it about flat in the first half. Just wondering if you could help us understand how that compares to your expectation and how -- really, how Ocado is ramping within that? I see here this 34% growth in delivery sales. But just are you on pace with the ramp of Ocado? And just about your goal in terms of doubling digital sales, how do you feel about that today? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, the thing that I think is always important is Ocado is one part of our overall digital strategy. And the thing that we're wanting to make sure that we have is a seamless ecosystem where customers can easily go between delivery, pickup and shopping in stores. And what we find is, by far, the majority of the people that -- customers that stop engaging with us on pickup come back into store and we capture that in-store versus delivery. So when you look at the overall seamless system, we're really focused on how do we -- and that's one of the reasons we introduced Boost, is how do we have that total loyalty across all the engagements with the customer. 
 If you look at -- the thing that I'm super proud of our teams on the sheds that as we open them in the spokes is our Net Promoter Score from those continue to be world-class and incredibly strong. And that business -- and the customer continues to engage more frequently with us there. And overall, I'm pleased with the results, but we still obviously have plenty of work to do. 
 I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to the question? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of things. Overall, I would say, Kelly, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the quarter. As you heard me mention in my prepared comments, we're certainly starting to see some traction on some of the key initiatives that we've been investing in, whether it's the Customer Fulfillment Centers that are powered by Ocado in both new and existing markets, the launch of Boost and as Boost continues to ramp up and we see about 25% of customers that sign up for Boost are completely new to digital. So that's a really good driver of the digital business as well. 
 And then we're still in the early infancy stages of some of those convenience trip missions that I mentioned, whether it's Kroger Delivery Now with our partnership with Instacart, where products can be delivered, smaller baskets, within 30 minutes, and also the meal solutions, things like sushi and [indiscernible]. So a lot of really exciting developments and activities that we're focused on, and we saw some good momentum in those areas coming through, which is why we also shared in my prepared comments that we'd expect the momentum to continue in the back half of the year. 
 I think the only other comment I would make is that we are taking a step back certainly to figure out what is the overall market digital growth is likely to look like this year because Rodney mentioned during his prepared comments that we're building a seamless ecosystem for the customer and what we're seeing and customers are moving between the channels and making the decisions of where they shop. And ultimately, we want to make sure the customer will go to Kroger and they're choosing to shop through the store or pickup or delivery, whatever works for them. And we certainly have certain assumptions around how we thought the digital market will grow this year, and we've sort of taken a step back as we look at the back half of the year and really sort of assess how we think the market overall is growing. But our focus is really on making sure that seamless ecosystem is winning the customers' loyalty overall, whichever channel they choose to shop through. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: I just wanted to talk about the price gaps for a minute. Could you talk about how comfortable you are with where you're trending today? And have you noticed any change in your ability to pass through price increases as some of your peers have been a bit more rational on that front? 
W. McMullen: Yes, if you look overall, we continue to be satisfied with inflation and the pass-through. As Gary and I both mentioned, we're doing everything we can to minimize those increases and do it in a way that helps the customer in any way we can. And when you look at the total value proposition, we feel very good. When you look at fuel rewards, as I mentioned, we had 600,000 incremental households engaging in fuel rewards and record redemption from customers as well. 
 So overall, we're doing -- I feel very good about the ability to balance all the pieces and minimize the impact on the customer as much as we can. We feel very comfortable with our price gaps. And price gaps is with a multiple of different competitors is something that we track on an ongoing basis. And we feel good about the everyday price gap. And as you know, we get great feedback from customers on our promotional approach and customers really appreciate the promotional values that we offer as well to allow customers to stock up on items they use the most. 
 And we are very focused on using our data to make sure our offers are personalized for each household individually and discounts that just apply to them. And that's probably part of what's driving the fact that we had 750 million coupons downloaded as well. 
Spencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then just to go back to Ocado for a minute. What are you seeing from the facilities that are located in the new geographies versus your existing markets? And as we think about the profitability of these sheds, any updated view on when we'll get to breakeven EBITDA there? 
W. McMullen: Yes, I'll answer the first part of that and let Gary answer the second part of your question, Spencer. We continue to ramp up and the ramp in new markets would be among some of the best [indiscernible] sheds across the Ocado network. And as I mentioned before, the NPS scores are outstanding, a world-class or whatever positive you want to assign to them. And as customers engage with us with our Boost membership or our membership programs, that's causing them to even be more loyal as well. 
 In terms of the financial side, Gary, I'll let... 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. I wouldn't say, Spencer, if there's anything dramatically changed in our view that we shared previously around how we think about the CFCs powered by Ocado maturing over time. I think, as Rodney mentioned, we've certainly been pleased with what we're seeing with customer connection and sales trends. And when we think about the Net Promoter Scores and the value that we're offering, we're seeing that the gross margin profile, if you like, of that customer and also the growth that we have expected is very much in line with what we have originally envisaged. 
 As you know, I think one of the key things for us with the big facilities is it is a 4 to 5-year journey as you're building to maturity and building to scale. And so there are some elements of that, that until you kind of understand what the customer density looks like at scale, we're still figuring out some of that operational efficiency in the model. So there's nothing really new I would call out, but we continue to work on building that full picture. And as you know, in the first two facilities, we're only 18 months really in that journey of a 4-year journey overall to get to capacity. But generally, I'd say still consistent with what we shared previously. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: There was about a 50-basis point acceleration in your 3-year geometric stack. Was that all driven by an acceleration in inflation from the first to the second quarter? And it looks like your guidance implies that you're expecting your IDs to go back to that kind of high 5% run rate in the second half of the year on the same 3-year geometric stack basis. So would that also imply that you're expecting the lower contribution from inflation in the back half of the year? 
W. McMullen: Part of it, Michael, is we're starting to cycle higher inflation a year ago. So it's really -- we do not expect inflation on inflation to be as high. So it's really driven by the cycling of where we were a year ago. And as you would recall, as we get later in the year, inflation ramped up very aggressively in the back half of last year. We expect the business to continue to stay strong and continue to make strong progress. We just don't expect the inflation to be quite as high as it was. 
 The first part of your question, Gary, you may have been able to just -- yes, you're kind of working in and out. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Michael, I think we tend not to look at it specifically in the way that you're describing at that 3-year view. But I would say that overall, we think about our progress in the second quarter, we believe we were able to accelerate our growth relative to Q1 compared to the market. So we felt that from everything you could see, we were able to win customers and to change trajectory versus how the market was moving from Q1 to Q2. So we feel very positive about the momentum that we saw in the business in Q2. 
 And as Rodney mentioned, we believe that momentum will continue in the back half of the year, but we are expecting while inflation will remain at heightened levels, we think it will start to taper out because with the cycling, call it, 4% higher inflation in the back half of last year compared to the first half of last year. So even if inflation does continue to grow, you're cycling about 4% higher inflation rate from the prior year. 
 And we are starting to see a little bit of data that would say it's really hard to predict, and none of us had our perfect crystal ball. But if you look at the growth in cost inflation from Q1 to Q2, it would be less than the growth that we saw in Q4 last year to Q1 this year. And some of the forward-looking futures data on some of the key commodities are starting to show a little bit of signs that things may be leveling off somewhat. So obviously, there's been plenty of shocks in the last 12 months that can change that very quickly. But the data points that we can see right now, we think it's appropriate to forecast and provide guidance that it seems slightly tapering to the inflation rate in the back half of the year. 
Michael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is Kroger's been pretty nimble in managing its FIFO gross margin, as was evidenced by this quarter. Was some of that due to the ability to pass along price increases a little faster than you're getting the price increases passed along to you from your vendor community? And it does seem like some consumable retailers are announcing that they're going to make sizable price investments in the back half of the year. So how does that influence your view of the ability to sustain this FIFO gross margin performance over the next couple of quarters? 
W. McMullen: Well, obviously, all -- everything that you asked would have been reflected in our guidance for the balance of the year. We would -- most CPGs, you know well in advance of cost increases. So you're balancing the actual getting the cost increase along with what you pass through to customers. Obviously, you are -- on a weekly basis, you're looking at what pricing, where you are on spreads, better or worse than your competitors. 
 And the other thing that I think it's always important to remember for a customer that shops at Kroger, there's personalized rewards that are individualized for each household that the market would never see. And that's something that's incredibly valuable for our customers in addition to our fuel rewards and other pieces. So I think you really have to look at the total value proposition. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe just to add, Rodney, I think, Michael, from the perspective of how we manage gross margin, I think of it much more of a -- we're not trying to manage to a number every quarter. Obviously, we're managing it more long term and there's lots of moving parts that we manage. The tailwinds would be the work we do in sourcing, the mix improvements through fresh growing and Our Brands growing and new innovation products. And of course, things like alternative profit streams adding to that model as well. So we're still investing in the customer. And from our perspective, we feel very good about our ability to manage the model through the evolving environment. 
 And overall, again, if you look at our rolling 12 months of gross margin, it's probably in that sort of 10 to 20 basis points of investment. And I think that's what we shared at the beginning of the year where we expect it to be. So we are delivering, we believe, on the plan that we shared. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: My question is on the consumer to diagnose some of the changes we're seeing. It looks like there was some trade down brewing across all of consumer. And you mentioned that your business picked up from June throughout the quarter. So can you talk about if you're seeing a level of either trading down or movement to private brands you heard, is the level, is it stabilizing? Did it [indiscernible] inside with gasoline prices leveling off and [indiscernible] getting stronger now? Or would this [indiscernible]? 
W. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, they're telling us they're modifying behavior more so outside of the grocery store than with us. Now the movement to Our Brands, what we always find is customers do it initially to save a little bit of money, but they fall in love with the product. So part of the continued acceleration of growth in Our Brands is driven by the value, but part of it is just the quality of the product. And that's been something that's been a long-term trend, not just a current trend. 
 The customers -- it's one of the reasons why we're so proud of our overall offering is customers can move between different types of product. But we still see customers engaging in things that are fresh, and are healthy, those aspects as well. So we're going to be there forever how the customer wants and needs us to be, and we're going to be very agile as well. 
Simeon Gutman: Abbreviated follow-up is inflation. It sounds like we're not quantifying what the absolute level is. You all know we're going to see a moderation in the second half. Let's just say you're running in line with CPI for food and home. Could that actually get cut in half in the back half of the year? Is it going to be more moderate? And then in terms of elasticity, does it actually behave that quickly where you're seeing units for volume actually respond and go back up, so we're in the same place anyway? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I mean I think from what we see, we wouldn't expect it to be that dramatic a change. As I mentioned, I think we would expect there to be some flattening out of inflation in the back half of the year, but there's nothing that we see right now that would cause us to believe there's going to be a dramatic change in the level of inflation in the back half of the year. 
 And from our perspective, I think it probably ties back to Rodney's earlier comment, we feel that we're monitoring and using our data very closely to adapt as to how customers change behavior. And we believe through the combination of fuel rewards, through the Our Brands portfolio of products that we offer and through the pricing and promotional offers that we have, we've got a very strong sort of portfolio of plans to be able to adapt to the customer with us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan Chase. 
Kenneth Goldman: I was curious, you mentioned Home Chef. Were there any other categories or broader departments where your brands were maybe surprisingly strong this quarter? I would assume the usual suspect milk and soy were healthy. But were there others where the -- I guess the share shift was bigger than you might typically see in this kind of environment? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's really broad-based. And the banner brand, I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but the banner brand continues to gain solid share. But even if you look at like private selection, which has a lot of unique and new products, the growth there continued to be strong as well. So it was very broad-based across really the whole store. 
Kenneth Goldman: Got it. And then on the higher OG&A this quarter, you called out a few reasons for -- and thank you for that. One of them was a onetime accrual catch-up. Can you give us a sense -- I don't think I heard how big that catch-up was? And then on the margin expansion initiatives, I recognize it's an ongoing process. But just in light of where the OG&A came in, were there any new initiatives launched? Is there anything that we should think about that may be unique that we haven't necessarily heard about yet? Or just is more of the ongoing process that you have? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think what I would say is overall, if you think about there's probably three pieces that impacted OG&A materially during the quarter. The one you mentioned, which was the true-up for the first half of the year on our incentive calculation based on our improved performance, we calculate what the [indiscernible] would be for the year. And so we have to catch up for the first 2 quarters in the year. 
 Secondly, as you mentioned, we invested in some strategic initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth as we look into '23 and beyond in particular, and I'll come back to that in a second. The third would be, we were cycling 1 or 2 items that were -- as of the timing were particularly strong in Q2 last year. So when you add those three things together and sort of remove them from the number, we would have achieved an improvement in the OG&A rate during the quarter, which is why we kind of guided you to when we take out those three factors, which wouldn't repeat in our view for the rest of the year, but we would expect overall for the rest of the year to see OG&A rate improvement. It's probably fairly flat in Q3, but likely to be meaningfully better than that in Q4 is how we would think about it. And I wouldn't want to get into maybe breaking down the digital because we typically don't do that. But I would just say that all three of those together will really what caused the increase in the rates. 
 As regards to the new initiatives, I think it is more of what you've seen before. It's more just that as we look at how the customer is changing and our business model continues to evolve. We identified 2 or 3 areas where we think there are opportunity to accelerate. And an example would be in shrink and investing in some new capabilities to be able to continue to improve shrink performance as we look out for the forecast for our model on shrink and that, of course, helps gross margin as well. 
 And then I mentioned earlier, but we're really pleased with the progress that we made in health and wellness during the quarter, and we made some strategic investments in the health and wellness space where we believe there's an opportunity for us to continue to drive profitable growth, not only in the second half of this year as we cycle the vaccines for last year but also beyond in 2022 and 2024. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. 
Robert Moskow: I wonder if you could give a little more color on the Smart brands initiative. Is it providing anything new to the consumer in terms of opening price points, like lower price points than before? Or you're really just consolidating several of your sub-brands to make it a little easier to shop? And then I just had a quick follow-up. 
W. McMullen: The majority is consolidating the sub-brands, just making it easier to shop. Those items are always great value for the money. The other thing that there would be incremental items introduced under the Smart Way brand in terms of just the absolute number of SKUs. So it's really a combination of introducing some new items and consolidating several sub-brands and making it easier for customers to shop. 
Robert Moskow: Okay. And then a follow-up on CapEx. You're not the first to lower CapEx guidance among consumer goods companies. And it all -- it usually seems to be because of project delays. But I imagine volume is less than what you had expected this year because the pricing is so high. So is there any correlation here between like a lower volume environment in an inflationary cycle and what your CapEx plans might be for the next couple of years? 
Gary Millerchip: I wouldn't say, Robert, really changes our view of the opportunity ahead of us. As you know, we've laid out a clear plan at our Investor Day in March, and we still feel really confident in both the growth model that we outlined and where we believe the strategic investments will make sense across the supply chain, across our store portfolio and obviously continue to invest in digital. So I wouldn't read into it that we're any less excited or have less confidence in those plans. It's far more the former point that you made. But when we look at some of the short-term supply challenges, when we look at some of the costs in the market in the short term, it just made more sense in our view to balance that plan and to adjust the schedule. So it would be far more in that camp than the other. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Brandon Cheatham ] on for Paul. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit on the fuel margin cents per gallon were very strong in the quarter, but it sounds like you expect fuel to be a headwind in the second half. So can you help us, how much of the fuel margin was driven kind of by internal initiatives or external market forces that I guess you're not expecting to repeat in the second half? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Overall, our team did a fantastic job in managing fuel margins. And as I think you probably know, we -- our goal is to make sure we're very competitive on price, and then we give significant value back to our customers via our fuel rewards program that flows through our supermarket gross margin, not through that fuel P&L that we share -- the metrics that we shared on the call. So overall, last quarter would certainly have been some great work by our team in capturing value wherever they go through sourcing of fuel and how we promoted and drove engagement with customers. But a lot of it is also just to do with the volatility in the market and as prices were changing in the fuel market, which I think has been seen across the industry. 
 So as we look forward, we believe we have a clear strategy around delivering great value for the customer, making sure we're sourcing the product really effectively, optimizing the reward program. Our view at some point is that fuel margins sort of normalize, and we don't think it's prudent for us to predict these extremely high unusual levels of profitability. So I wouldn't say we have perfect insight into what will happen to fuel margins in the back half of the year. We think it's prudent to bring them back to more of what we thought would be a normal rate at the beginning of the year. If it turns out that there is significantly greater margins on fuel then, of course, that would impact our outcome for the rest of the year, but we think it would be not prudent for us to be forecasting that. That's really how we think about the rest of the year. 
Unknown Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could break out price inflation, how much that drove ID sales in the quarter? And how much of that was offset by units? I assume, declined slightly in the quarter. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think just a bit of color maybe to the last comment, we mentioned on this one would be that our sales growth was higher than the increase that we saw from Q1 to Q2, was higher than the increase we saw in cost inflation. So overall, we're pleased with the trajectory in our growth. And we believe compared to the market, we were able to improve our trajectory, Q2 versus Q1 compared to how the market overall performed. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, [ Brandon ], for the question. The other thing I think is important that I mentioned earlier is that we had household growth overall and loyal household growth as well, which is always important for the future. 
Rob Quast: Alex, we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So maybe just a follow-up to the prior question. Just any perspective just on market share? It sounds like your GAAP versus [ peers ] may have narrowed this quarter, but just any thoughts on the performance this quarter and then how you're looking at that for the balance of the year? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The gap has continued to narrow and it's narrowed during the quarter as well. And if you look at it for the balance of the year, our teams would expect to continue to make progress and really proud of where we are. And we think the overall value for the customer and the overall seamless experience and focus on fresh continues to accelerate, and the customer continues to reward us for that as well. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And one follow-up question, just on CapEx as well. So this year, CapEx is pretty significantly below your prior plan. Do you believe we could be in a period of just lower sustained CapEx spend just given some of the headwinds out there? 
Gary Millerchip: I think, Rupesh, like I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the plans we have to achieve our long-term -- or our overall TSR model around the growth that we've shared around growing earnings at 3% to 5% and our TSR at 8% to 11%. And we've got, I think, some very clear capital expenditure plans that we believe will allow us to drive that sustained growth. 
 So I think we are being deliberate in the short term about making sure the -- if the pricing of certain supplies and products just would change their return materially then we're adjusting our timing there, and there are some challenges just around labor and raw materials and getting the plans executed in the time scale that we'd originally envisaged. But I don't think for us, we look at the announcements that we made this morning on our latest forecast of CapEx as being less excited about the prospects of investing in the business for growth. I think it's more of a function of just some of the short-term headwinds for us. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 
 And as you know, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in as well. We are so proud of everything that everyone's achieved in this half of the year. Our outstanding associates continue to provide a world-class customer experience. And thank you directly on behalf of everyone for everything that you do for our community, our customers and each other every day. 
 I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our Louisville and Delta divisions and our manufacturing and distribution teams who responded immediately to help in the aftermath of a devastating flood in Eastern Kentucky and a water shortage in Jackson, Mississippi. Our store, manufacturing and distribution teams went to work to offer company and customer donations of supplies and funds and delivered more than 55,000 gallons of freshwater to both communities when they needed it. A huge thank you for stepping up to support our neighbors when they needed it the most. 
 I also want to congratulate our stores once again on achieving 100% execution of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue. Your efforts provide healthy food directly to our neighbors who need it the most. Thank you for your commitment to creating and supporting communities free from hunger and waste. 
 And thanks to everyone again for joining us today. That concludes our second quarter earnings call. 
Operator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes the Q2 earnings call. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-06-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Kroger Co. First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Alex, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]  
 I will now hand over to your host, Rob Quast, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Rob. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rodney McMullen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information.  
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] In response to your feedback on allowing more participants during Q&A, we may provide abbreviated responses to your follow-up questions to hear from as many of you as we can.  
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2022, delivering strong performance by successfully executing our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. Our associates' relentless focus on providing fresh, affordable food to our customers is driving our strong results.  
 During the quarter, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model led by strong top line sales ahead of internal expectations. In addition, our team navigated a challenging operating environment characterized by continued inflationary cost pressures and supply chain headwinds, which included higher diesel fuel costs. Through our strategic cost savings execution and sustained food-at-home trends, our team delivered 16% growth in adjusted FIFO operating profit, providing once again the strength of our financial model in a variety of operating environments.  
 Our teams are focused on delivering a great customer experience with 0 compromise. Rising inflation, as consumers rethinking their shopping and eating habits, while customers continue to cook more, we are seeing different shopping behaviors based on how individual customers are experiencing the current inflationary environment.  
 Many customers continue to shop premium products throughout the store, including Private Selection, Murray's Cheese and deluxe meal solutions. For other customers whose budget are more directly impacted by food and fuel inflation, they are actively looking for ways to save. We're doing everything we can to help this customer stretch their budgets.  
 I'd like to share more about the work we're doing for our customers and how our competitive moats uniquely position us to meet these challenging and changing customer needs.  
 First, we are leading with fresh. Our customers continue to prioritize fresh as the #1 determinant of where to shop. We are meeting their needs with operational efficiencies and new technologies that extend days of freshness and grow our selection of quality fresh products.  
 In the first quarter, we achieved 5.2% identical sales growth in our fresh categories. These gains were led by the expansion of our End-to-End Fresh Produce program, which elevates standards and improves our ability to maintain freshness throughout the supply chain.  
 We certified 355 stores this quarter, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also continue to increase our use of forecasting and analytical tools, specifically leveraging 84.51° to improve our ability to maintain fresh products in stock, both in store and online.  
 Our recent floral results are a great example of how we are leading with fresh. As the nation's largest florist, the first quarter was our time to shine for holiday celebrations and our floral team stepped up, achieving record sales. In fact, we set an overall single-day floral sales record on Valentine's Day and a Mother's Day sales record with strong double-digit growth.  
 Second is Our Brands. During the quarter, we saw tremendous growth in Our Brands, which had identical sales of 6.3% and outpaced all national brands. With 92% of households purchasing at least one of these products, we launched 239 new and innovative products during the quarter, reflecting many of the top food trend predictions we made at the beginning of the year. All of our new products continue to be tested and validated to ensure that they are as good or better than the comparable national brand. We continue to invest heavily in the quality of Our Brands, which preserves our strong price position and drives higher profitability.  
 Next area is personalization. Our data science platform provides unique insights that creates personalized customer experiences. In this dynamic environment where customer behaviors are changing rapidly, we use our data and insights to be nimble and react quickly to ever-changing needs. Our broad-based data science approach helps us determine how to best implement price, promotion and display.  
 We are focused on delivering incredible value to our customers through relevant personalized offers and fuel rewards. Our loyal customers are using our fuel rewards program now more than ever and, in fact, more than 600,000 incremental households engaged for the first time this quarter.  
 Finally, our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime, anywhere and with 0 compromise.  
 During the first quarter, more customers returned to in-store shopping. And as a result, we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup, we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery, we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality, affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community.  
 During the quarter, we opened 2 new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, bringing our total CFC count to 5.  We also opened 3 new spoke locations for a total of 6 spokes.  
 As we head into summer, our end-to-end cold solutions, including the custom-built refrigerated van, will ensure customers get the freshest product delivered directly to their doorstep.  
 Finally, our Boost membership is delivering promising results. Our one-of-a-kind membership program offers incredible value where customers can get unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more, double the fuel points on every dollar spent at Kroger and other exclusive member benefits.  
 We are encouraged by the number of new members in the 4 current pilot divisions. Importantly, delivery sales increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points.  
 Because of this early success, we are proud to announce today that Kroger Boost is launching nationwide beginning in the next few weeks. This next-generation loyalty program is deepening our relationships with customers as they continue to look for value and convenience.  
 Turning to supply chain. Our 2022 business plan anticipated ongoing supply chain challenges. By planning ahead and focusing on staffing, technology and process efficiencies, we manage our costs effectively. By owning and operating a portion of our fleet, we better control and manage transportation costs  despite diesel fuel cost headwinds. 
 We were also proactive about forward buying and securing capacity for goods, resulting in better vendor rates. Through our supplier relationships, we saw sequential improvement in product availability. We are well positioned to adapt to the evolving environment, and we are cautiously optimistic in a broader supply chain recovery throughout the year.  
 We also continue to invest in our associates and an associate experience that facilitates an amazing customer experience. We firmly believe that exceptional financial and operating performance connects directly to the ways we support and invest in our associates.  
 During the quarter, we took numerous steps to meet our associates' needs while they delivered for our customers. We continue to invest in associate wages and we expect hourly wages to grow throughout the year.  
 We launched new initiatives to simplify day-to-day work, including the modernized scheduling tool, MyTime. We took steps to improve communication across all of our teams and bring meaningful training to all of our associates no matter where they work. One example of this commitment is the addition of Microsoft Teams Rooms across most of our store locations. This technology improvement will facilitate deeper connections and improve the associate experiences.  
 As an employer of choice, more people are applying to work for Kroger and more associates are choosing to stay with us. While we still have work to do, we experienced a meaningful improvement in both hiring and retention in the months after the Omicron surge. We are also seeing more boomerangs. These are associates who left to work elsewhere and ultimately came back to us. Kroger's strong culture invites associates to come for a job and discover a career. And we're glad that so many value and appreciate our work environment, our culture and the people they work with every day.  
 Our winning culture is rooted in living our purpose to feed the human spirit. During the past last year, our teams took significant steps to support our customers and communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We introduced a new Kroger and USO co-branded mobile unit to nourish active duty military service members and their families at military bases and USO centers across the country as well as provide community disaster relief. The first of 4 units hit the road in May.  
 In summary, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. We are widening our competitive moats, creating a shopping experience with 0 compromise, investing where it matters most to our customers and associates and strengthening our purpose in large and small ways every day. When we do all of this well, our teams, our customers and our shareholders all win.  
 Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another quarter of strong results as our team did an outstanding job executing our go-to-market strategy while navigating a dynamic operating environment. Our results again highlight the strength and resilience of Kroger's financial model, which allowed us to continue to invest in our associates, deliver fresh, affordable food for our customers and create value for our shareholders.  
 I'll now provide more detail on our results in the quarter. Led by our competitive moats, we achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 4.1%. Fresh categories and Our Brands identical sales both outpaced overall company results.  
 Adjusted EPS was $1.45, up 22% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased sales and exceptional cost management during the quarter.  
 Digital sales declined 6% in the first quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to ramp the digital growth initiatives shared at our Investor Day, including enhanced personalization capabilities, Boost membership, customer fulfillment centers and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we grew digitally engaged households during the quarter, and we would expect digital sales to accelerate as the year progresses.  
 Gross margin was 21.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 26 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs, offset by sourcing benefits and the cycling of a write-down related to a donation of personal protective equipment inventory in the prior year.  
 Our team continues to do an excellent job managing higher product cost inflation. We are leveraging our data and sourcing expertise and working closely with our suppliers to help minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers and are using our proprietary data to deliver additional value through personalization.  
 Our Brands are also proving to be an important differentiator for our customers in this environment, providing an unmatched combination of great quality and great value.  
 We will continue to leverage these proven and unique capabilities to help our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and maintain a strong value proposition relative to our competitors as we believe inflation will remain front of mind for many of our customers for the remainder of 2022.  
 In recognition of current product cost inflation and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.06 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2021.  
 Our OG&A rate decreased 46 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We were successful in offsetting inflation headwinds in many parts of our business and continued investments in our associate wages by reducing costs in areas that do not impact the customer experience. As an example, this quarter, we introduced a new bakery forecasting tool, which is improving product freshness, reducing waste and, at the same time, simplifying the associate ordering process. We have a strong pipeline of process improvement initiatives and innovative technology-driven solutions that will lower digital fulfillment costs, increase store productivity and reduce waste and shrink.  
 For the fifth consecutive year, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings in 2022. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continue to create a strong flywheel effect for alternative profits. Led by retail media and Kroger Personal Finance, alternative profits are on track to contribute meaningful growth in 2022.  
 During the quarter, Kroger Precision Marketing added more than 100 new brand partners. We continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities and have entered into new agreements with 3 leading advertising management platforms, allowing our CPG partners to manage their on-site ad campaigns more effectively.  
 Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. We continue to deliver significant value through our loyalty program, which saves customers up to $1.25 per gallon. As Rodney shared earlier, more customers engaged with fuel rewards this quarter, and our gallons grew at a faster rate than the market.  
 The average retail price of fuel was $4 this quarter versus $2.79 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year.  
 Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers. we introduced a number of new initiatives to support associates this quarter as well as continuing to invest in hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our guidance and long-term financial model.  
 During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW in Denver, Southern California, Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Seattle, covering more than 67,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW in Las Vegas, Southern California for Ralphs pharmacies, Indianapolis, Roanoke, Chicago and Columbus.  
 Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.68 compared to 1.79 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5.  
 Consistent with our financial strategy, we are investing in the business to drive sustainable future earnings growth and continue to expect capital expenditures of between $3.8 billion and $4 billion in 2022.  
 During quarter 1, we were disciplined in returning cash to shareholders. In total, Kroger returned $819 million via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  
 We are operating from a position of financial strength and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess cash to accelerate our growth model and deliver sustainable total shareholder returns.  
 In closing, let me share additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. While there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook for the remainder of 2022, Kroger is laser-focused on executing the plans outlined at our Investor Day, and we believe our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in navigating the current environment.  
 Based on the strength of our quarter 1 results and sustained food-at-home trends, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 2.5% to 3.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.  
 Our updated guidance assumes inflation will remain at tightened levels for the remainder of the year, although we would expect the year-over-year rate to moderate in the second half of the year as we cycle higher inflation from quarter 3 and quarter 4 2021.  
 Due to this higher outlook for inflation, we now expect our LIFO full year charge will be in the range of $300 million compared to $197 million last year. As a reminder, while the actual LIFO charge is calculated at a point in time at the end of our fourth quarter, we recognize the projected charge evenly throughout the year.  
 Our guidance also assumes retail fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2022 as we cycle higher CPG margins from 2021.  
 Our full year projected tax rate has been lowered from 23% to 22%, primarily due to higher-than-expected tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises.  
 Overall, we are extremely pleased with our start to the year, which provides another proof point of the strength of our financial model. And looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth and total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.  
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I would like to once again acknowledge and thank our outstanding associates. Their hard work and dedication fuel our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy and our obsession for our customers. We continue finding new ways to help customers stretch their dollars through everyday prices, data-driven promotions, personalized experiences, trusted Our Brand products and a seamless e-commerce platform. We believe this relentless focus on delivering for customers will help us maintain robust sales and drive growth.  
 Moving ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  
 Now we'll turn to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Robby Ohmes of BofA Global Research. 
Robert Ohmes: Guys, great quarter. My question is, I was wondering if we could get a little more color on the ID sales. So maybe thoughts on what your -- the traffic component of that, what you're seeing in traffic, the ticket component and maybe specifically the inflation component in the ID sales.  
 And then sort of along with that, some of your competitors that sell groceries and food and beverage are seeing very strong sort of double-digit same-store sales. Is the price spread versus your competitors widening because of the price investments you're making? 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby, and good morning. If you look at -- in terms of traffic, the 2 areas that we felt really good about is if you look at the number of loyal shoppers we have and our household count, both improved. Now a typical basket size for a customer coming in continues to decline. Part of that is just driven because of the economic environment some customers are having.  
 If you look at identicals during the quarter, toward the end of the quarter, they finished a little stronger than where we were during the quarter, and that's continued so far early in the second quarter. Obviously, we're extremely early in the quarter.  
 Obviously, we do have a reasonable-sized general merchandise business that affect it as well. And the comment that I made in the prepared comments, if you look at our fresh departments, they were up over 5%.  
 So overall, we think the customers are doing a lot of work on balancing their total budget, and we continue to balance it as well with promotions. And then customers are aggressively starting to buy our brands and what they're finding is the quality of that product, and there's no compromise with that versus some of the other products. And if you look at our price spreads, we check pricing, obviously, every week. We look at pricing spreads for different types of customers. And those spreads continue to be where they've been or improving slightly has been the case over the last couple of years.  
 I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only other point you mentioned around total households and loyal households growing, we also saw visits improving during the quarter as well, Robby, which was -- we were really pleased with that trend as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. 
John Heinbockel: Yes. So let me start with our own brand, right? So it looks like own brand is probably growing 2x the rate of national brand. I'm curious, price spreads there, so maybe, Rodney, talk about that. Where you think own brand momentum goes from here? And I know historically, right, you guys have always said that own brand strength leads to increased CPG promotions. Do you think that will be true this time? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I love the question, John. And as you know, we're super proud of our brands and super proud of Private Selection, the banner brand and Simple Truth and then Home Chef is our most recent owned brand. 
 The -- that growth has been strong across all components. The only exception of that is Simple Truth was a little soft earlier in the quarter because we did have supply issues with one of the chicken suppliers. But other than that, growth is nice as well. 
 As you know, what we've always found is over time, our brands gain share, and that's been true for over 25 years. And when the economy is tight, our brands always gain share. And then once the economy is good, we may lose a little or maintain, but that's been the case all throughout. Because what customers find is once they try it, they love it. 
 We -- if you look at our leadership team, our -- we've gone and really upgraded our leadership team in terms of our focus on our brands. And for us, it really is -- we look at it the same as a national brand. Our customers do. And as I mentioned, over 90% of our customers include it in their basket. So feel really good. 
 Your second part of your question about the national brand change. I think there's still a lot of capacity constraints among some of the national brands. So I would expect if it's a national brand with capacity, you'll see a typical trend where they get more aggressive in promoting as their tonnage goes down. But if they're supply constrained, I would be surprised. And part of that is just because all of us are exiting COVID at a level of volume higher than what we had going in, which has put different people at different points on supply constraints. 
John Heinbockel: A quick follow-up to that. Forward buying, right? Normally, a big P&L benefit in inflationary times. It sounds like today, it's limited, right, because of their capacity constraints? 
W. McMullen: Yes. We do -- the excess warehouse space that we took on as part of COVID, a lot of that space, we've continued to keep. And I would say we're using that space to be able to get product when we can get it. So I think a lot of the CPGs are using it to level out production. So when they have excess production, we're taking that. And it, in essence, becomes forward buy, but I don't think it will be as big as it's been in past situations. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I'll ask my question and follow-up, one shot here. 
 First, Rodney, I want to ask about the competitive environment. It feels like it's pretty rational out there, and it seems like the consumer has been price taking for the last, call it, number of months. And even Walmart mentioned 1.5 weeks ago they're not getting in too aggressive on price. I want to ask you, now that the consumer basket or consumer behavior is starting to change, might this environment change? Do we think -- do you think we're at a new normal in terms of promotional activity? Or do you think this is -- yes, I don't want to put it like a house of cards, but it feels like everyone's kind of playing nice and something can break. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Well, it's a good question. And obviously, we always spend a lot of time focused on it. 
 Your first comment, we are seeing the competitive environment pretty similar to what it's been. As you know, our go-to-market strategy really is Leading With Fresh. And what we find is it's the most important reason why somebody decides where to shop. And our teams are really working hard to take our fresh experience to the next level, and our customers are telling us they appreciate what they're doing and they're seeing that improvement. 
 So when you look at it, we think price is just one component. We're going to make sure that we always maintain a reasonable spread in the things that we're good at with our rewards program, our fuel rewards and our fresh go-to-market strategy. Those things matter, and that's where we're going to win in the marketplace. And we expect that to continue to be important in every imaginable environment going forward. 
 So to me, it's one of those things where it's important, we continually check. But we always think it's important to remember it's the total customer experience that we're focused on rather than price alone. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus of Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: Can you provide some more color on the FIFO adjusted gross margins in the quarter? Because it looks like that slowed sequentially. And then you said your price gaps are well positioned, but do you think you're going to need to invest further in price in the second half as we just see sort of inflation pick up and that consumer gets under more pressure? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I'll cover that, and Rodney can add any additional color he'd like to. 
 Generally, our gross margin rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter. As you heard us share, we had 2 major investments during the quarter, which was investing in value for the customer and also the supply chain headwinds that we -- as Rodney mentioned in his prepared comments, we fully expected during the year. 
 Overall, we feel like we were right in line with what we expect it to be. I know we called out in our comments around the PPE inventory write-off, that really wasn't material enough to sort of be something that I think investors should be thinking about is going to be a factor in our expectations for the rest of the year. I think we shared in our original guidance for the year that we believe gross margin would be a headwind during the year as we made the investments in price and supply chain. The first quarter played out largely as we expected. 
 We don't call out all the puts and takes in the quarter. And things like COVID vaccines would have been a tailwind last year, that wouldn't have been a tailwind this year. 
 So I think there's a lot of extra moving parts in there. And what we try and do is call out the pieces that we've communicated previously so we're consistent and also give you a flavor for the major moving parts. But overall, we felt the quarter was very much in line with strategy, and we wouldn't be pointing to a change in that for the rest of the year. 
 I'll maybe just add one piece of additional color because I know it's kind of something I've seen as a sort of question floating around before the call started was, certainly, the gross margin outlook hasn't changed. That's not a factor in how we think our guidance looks for the rest of the year. We're very confident with how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year. 
 I think that some of the factors to bear in mind when you think about the second half, I mentioned it in my prepared comments, but LIFO for the year is going to be about $150 million higher than budget and about $100 million higher than prior year spread across the 4 quarters. We do expect fuel margins will be a headwind for the rest of the year and directionally think of that as maybe a $50 million or so headwind as well. 
 So I think about it more of the underlying trends that we shared during the quarter is something that we feel is right on track with our plan. But there are some unique factors that will influence the second half of the year. And from our perspective, those are generally going to be things that you won't have to cycle in 2023, but there are obviously headwinds in the rest of this year in terms of our overall financial outlook. 
W. McMullen: The other thing I think it's always important to remember is we always look at gross margin in light of our OG&A cost as well. And obviously, our teams did an incredible job of managing OG&A costs. And we always will invest some of those OG&A savings in trying to extend the customer's budget, especially in an environment like this where it's important. And I think some of those reasons are the reasons why our customer counts have improved as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: I have a couple of questions. I just -- and they can all kind of tie into one. But the first is on your actual volume versus your comp. So as you look at your guidance, we know where CPI is and we know what your implied 2Q to 4Q guidance is. So it certainly implies demand destruction from a volume and tonnage perspective. So wondering if you could talk about that. 
 And then specifically on your full guide, obviously, we came back into the FIFO guide for operating profit for 2Q to 4Q. It looks like you'll be down about 6% on that operating profit number versus where you were at this quarter which is up around 16%. So wondering if you could triangulate those 2. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Karen. Yes, I think the first part of the question would be, as I mentioned it a moment ago, around we look at the guidance for the rest of the year. Our overall outlook for inflation is that we do expect inflation is going to be higher for the rest of the year than we originally expected when we sort of entered 2022 and provided our original guidance. 
 Having said that, it's important, I think, to remember that we don't have a perfect crystal ball, of course, like all of us are trying to figure out there are multiple scenarios that could play out. I think our central scenario though is that we think inflation will remain higher. But as we cycle about a 4% increase in inflation in the second half of last year compared to the first half of last year, absolute annual inflation, we may well actually start to see a more moderated number in the second half of the year. So we're currently assuming inflation in the second half as a headline rate maybe a couple of percentage points or so lower than the first half of the year. 
 So we're actually -- if you think about our sales guidance, we are assuming that we see some momentum in our units because of the way we're thinking about inflation. Now of course, that outcome could be different and that will impact the outcome of the results that we report, but our overall assumption is based on that kind of high-level view, which we think takes into account all the different data points that we've been able to look at both internally and externally. 
 And then from an operating profit perspective, as I mentioned a few moments ago, from really the way we think about the rest of the year, our overall EPS guidance, if you kind of look at the midpoint of our new range for the rest of the year, it would be flat to slightly down. I think the really key messages in that would be think about the, as I mentioned a moment ago, the LIFO charge will be having a major impact on that, both versus budget and versus prior year. And as I mentioned, whereas fuel would have been a tailwind in the first quarter, it will actually be a headwind for the rest of the year. So we think of the sort of supermarket business as being robust and relatively on track in terms of what we would have expected and continuing to build momentum. It's really around those other factors that are driving the lack of sort of carryforward of the momentum on year-over-year growth in the first quarter when you look at that relative to the rest of the year. 
Karen Short: As well as the vaccine headwind, correct? 
Gary Millerchip: Vaccine headwind would have been in the first quarter probably a factor, and then it would also be a factor in Q2 and Q3. But again, I wouldn't think of that as being a major headwind on what -- so that was probably a bigger factor in Q1 as any quarter. So I wouldn't think of the gross margin performance that we saw in the first quarter of the year as being dramatically different expectation in the remaining quarters based on the impact of vaccine and other factors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just want to go back to grocery market share. Just want to get a sense of how your markets are held up in the grocery category. And I guess related to that, it sounds like the general merchandise category had some headwinds. So just wondering if that contributed maybe to the weaker ID performance. 
W. McMullen: If you look at grocery market share for the -- overall, it's pretty much close to where we thought it would be. We would expect continued improvement throughout the year, which was reflected in the original guidance. 
 Your comment on general merchandise is correct. Our general -- if you look at our identicals in total, without general merchandise, it would be pretty similar to where the fresh IDs were. 
 And the general merchandise, obviously, households are starting to change their behavior on shopping and it shows up there. And obviously, some of the savings and things that customers had from not being able to spend money on service as well is showing up there. 
 So we are making progress on market share overall and would expect to continue to make marked improvements as we go along in the year. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one quick housekeeping question. I know last quarter, you gave quarterly cadence guidance. Is that still intact on the comp and EPS line? Or I don't know if there's any updated views there. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Just briefly, I would say, on the EPS side of things, I mentioned a moment ago, Rupesh, that I think if you look at the guidance for the back -- the last 3 quarters of the year, it would sort of predominantly be around the sort of flat to slightly down. I would think of that, if you look at the cadence last year, it would be relatively consistent if you think about the next 3 quarters. So I wouldn't call out any dramatic year-over-year variance to that overall. 
 And then I think on a sales perspective, as we mentioned, we would expect the first half to be a little bit better than the second half in terms of sales. That's predicated on this belief though that inflation continues at heightened levels. But on a year-over-year basis, the back half would be potentially a few basis points lower because we're cycling 4% higher inflation in the second half of last year than the first half of last year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: I wanted to go back to the question on -- I want to go back to the question just on tonnage and underlying unit volume. Rodney, I think when we were sort of all looking at this quarter, I think we would all, on the investor side, agree that we probably thought your ID would be better given the trends that we saw in inflation. And I'm kind of curious as to what you are seeing in underlying tonnage. And then you talked about, I think I heard you right when you said that basket is down despite that backdrop. So I'm just kind of curious as to what you're seeing on like that side. And do you think any -- are you seeing anything that is being caused by changes in consumer behavior, right, whether that's sort of like channel shifting, seeking value, that type of stuff? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look on the basket size, that's driven by units per basket. And what we're finding is customers are coming in more frequently before but they're not buying as many items on each shop. And that's what we're seeing. 
 We're also seeing customers, especially customers that aren't as sensitive to their budget, upscaling with or buying bigger packs, especially earlier in the month when -- depending on when people were getting money. So we continue to see both of those dynamics. If you look at the fresh departments, the trends there would be better than the overall. 
 The -- if you look at overall units, we -- for most of the CPG partners, we would be tracking pretty similar to where their unit changes are overall in the marketplace in -- if you look at our top 25. 
 I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? And I know you're pulling up some... 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Well, I think just to clarify maybe the comment we made, the total basket size is actually up. It's the number of units in the basket that are down. So if we look at our overall metrics, households are up, loyal households are up, visits have turned positive, basket size is up. But the number of items in the basket, as Rodney mentioned, is the item that I think customers are adapting behavior as they start to manage the inflationary environment. And that's obviously a focus area for us to use data personalization and different tools around rewards to really aim to continue to drive that up. 
 And as I mentioned, if you look at our second half guidance as we expect in our current assumption, inflation would be, on a year-over-year basis, maybe not as quite as high even though remaining at sustained levels, then our guidance reflects the expectation that we continue to make progress on that front. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think that you said that you sort of expected the gross margin trend for the rest of the year to be similar to Q1. Did you mean the year-over-year decline? Or did you mean multiyear? Just kind of curious as to what you were talking about there. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I wouldn't want to get into specific guidance because of the comment that Rodney mentioned around we do try and manage the business dynamically. I think what I was really saying, Ed, was it was specific to the current year. I'm really saying that when you think about Q1, I think there was some concern that the PPE write-down was somehow need to be reversed out and that would be the trend that we're seeing in terms of gross margin rate. So I think the guidance that we shared at the beginning of the year was we expected gross margin to be a headwind. We didn't expect the volatility to be as significant as we've seen in the past. And as I mentioned, the PPE is really one of a number of puts and takes. But because we called it out last year in the first quarter, we didn't want to not clearly mention it again in the current quarter, but I wouldn't see it as a major factor. And so it was related to Q1 was the -- that's the kind of directional shape of gross margin, which is, I think, consistent with what we shared when we gave our guidance for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. 
Michael Montani: Just wanted to ask, first off, looking at food-at-home inflation, it looks like it was up just about double digits for your quarter calendarized. And if we adjusted that, given your gen merch mix a little bit, maybe it's a point or 2 below. But just wanted to see, is that kind of the right way to think about what you might have been able to pass through to the consumer given that PPI is so much ahead of those levels? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I always think it's important to look at CPI and PPI together. And it's also the reason why we shared a little bit more details about Our Brands than normal because you have -- customers are doing their own behavior in terms of changing the way they shop. 
 So if you think about, in some cases, a national brand item may cost $3 and Our Brand might be $1 or $2. So that would show up and would cause our inflation rate not to be as high as what's in the marketplace. 
 I also think it's important to remind people that on -- when you look at Our Brands overall, our gross margin's about 600 basis points better than the national brand. And if you look at profit per item, it's similar or, in many cases, actually higher. 
 So to me, I would look at those numbers as general directional things but not specifics to be able to compare directly just because customers' behavior is changing.  And if you look at like in pork, as an example, customers aggressively moved to pork during the quarter. And some of that movement was at the expense of people not buying as much beef because it's a great value for the money, as an example. 
 So you have -- within all the data, you have a lot of customer behavior changes. But I think it's helpful directionally, but not exactly. 
Michael Montani: Okay. And then for a follow-up, if I could, was just around the $1 billion plus of gross cost savings. I was just wondering if that would be kind of metered out evenly throughout the course of the year and how it might compare to kind of inflationary pressures you might be seeing in wages and/or transportation with diesel at record highs. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. The $1 billion of savings would certainly be sort of an ongoing flow of initiatives. So certainly think about it as being consistently sort of building from -- so we've got a certain number of benefits from last year that flow through, and then we're introducing new initiatives this year. So because we're on this 5-year journey, $1 billion of savings, it's very much a continual flow of new initiatives that are being implemented in the business to drive those efficiencies and savings. 
 So I'd certainly think of it in general terms as being fairly consistently throughout the year. Now of course, there are a number of puts and takes in lines and we continue to invest in average hourly rates. I think we mentioned in the first quarter, there was a benefit from lower pension contributions during the first quarter. So I wouldn't think of the OG&A rate improvement that we saw in Q1 as being typical for the year. But we do expect to continue to see OG&A rate in the year being an improvement and a tailwind for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: In light of the perception that your food categories were up, call it, 5% in the quarter and Nielsen was up 6%, the mass merchants were comping and improving leverage up high single, double digits. There's a perception out there, Rodney, that Kroger lost market share during the period. Why would that have been the case? And you made a comment that you expect your market share trends to improve in the next couple of quarters. What do you expect will drive that improvement? 
W. McMullen: If you look, all of us, our quarters end at a little different time. So it's always difficult to be exactly comparison. And I know some of the competitors don't break out specific by category. And I know for us, obviously, general merchandise is a bigger part of our business than some of our traditional competitors, not as much as some of the big-box competitors. 
 If you look at during the quarter, our trends improved as we went along during the quarter. As Gary mentioned, our household count went up, increased. Our loyal household count went up. And our visits in total also increased. And our trends improved as well. So those are the things that give us confidence in terms of the things that we're doing and the direction we're headed is continuing to move in the right direction. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. The only other thing maybe I would add, Rodney, is that the comments we made, Michael, about digital growth and the expectation that with the investments we're making in customer fulfillment centers, the announcement -- the exciting announcement that Rodney shared this morning around Boost membership launching across the whole of the company, we feel that the momentum that we're seeing starting to build in digital will also be an important component of that growth in the future as well. 
Michael Lasser: And if I could add a quick clarifying question on that. The perception is also that over the next couple of quarters, economic pressure across a broader swath of consumers, not just those at the lowest income demographic, that pressure is going to increase. And that might push people to shop more at the dollar stores, might push them to shop more at the warehouse clubs, where the perception is that they may be able to stretch their budget a little further. So in response to that, what is Kroger going to need to do, invest more in price, change pack sizes and other actions that could impact its profitability to prevent customers from going elsewhere? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Michael. Yes, I think briefly, we see that as an opportunity actually for Kroger because what we tend to see in those more economically challenged times is that the customer that's less stressed, as you described them, actually views Kroger as a high-quality place to get more value compared to maybe shopping a larger number of stores, and we even see it with some of our own brand performance. Rodney mentioned the strong value and ingredients for cooking at home, but we also saw strength during the quarter in Private Selection and Meal Solutions. So we see that as an opportunity for us to really connect with that customer as they start to maybe determine the best place to shop for quality and value combined. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. 
Katharine McShane: I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how conversations are going with your vendor partners currently, especially in light of the ongoing inflation to the second half. Have you been able to push back with regards to some of the cost inflation? And will you be getting more aggressive in those conversations like some of your competitors have suggested? 
W. McMullen: It's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, overall, we try to make sure that we have a partnership relationship. It's also one of the values in having Our Brands so it's such a strong component. So we understand true cost increases versus somebody just wanting to raise margins. 
 In many cases, with the CPG partners, we're identifying areas where we can work together to take costs out so that we can reduce it. And like on backhauls is an area that we're making great progress on by using technology, both of our technologies and databases, to understand how to change. 
 I would say that we're going to always push back on any type of cost increase that's not justified. And we're going to also try to work together to figure out a way to reduce our combined costs whenever we can. 
 I think it's a difficult answer to say how are we doing versus competition or competitors. I'm super proud of our procurement team. As Gary mentioned earlier, one of the big component on the cost saves is renegotiating both things not for resell and resell [ both ]. So we feel good about where we are, but it's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, it's a little more difficult dialogue when you have such high inflation. 
Katharine McShane: And if I could just ask an unrelated follow-up. Just with regards to the Boost rollout, are there any more details with regards to the timing of that? And I know there was higher retention and other metrics you cited, but was there also a comp lift impact from Boost during the quarter in those 3 test regions? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the test regions, it would positively affect our identicals. And the thing that's most important to us is it causes that customer to be stickier to our overall ecosystem, not just on delivery. So -- and our strategy is that if a customer thinks food, we want them to think Kroger. So we feel good about where we are and it's continued in the right direction. 
Operator: Our final question for today comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Rodney, if you talk about your e-commerce sales, they were down 6% overall. Can you shed some light on the components of that because I don't think it reflects what's going on with the new CFCs and spokes. So where is the negative numbers coming from? And how are the -- how is the Ocado-based facilities performing? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at -- pickup would be the area where we would have the biggest decline. And what -- as I mentioned, what we're finding is that customer, as they get comfortable, they move back into stores. And the retention rate is better than the overall retention rate. 
 If you look at the sheds, the NPS scores continue to be outstanding. The retention rate and repeat purchase rate on the sheds is very strong. And they're continuing to move in the right direction. 
 And if you look toward the end of the quarter in the recent few weeks, our performance on year-on-year for online has actually turned to positive. 
 So the first quarter was pretty similar to where we thought it would be because we were cycling some strong numbers early in the quarter, and the trend has moved back into the positive neighborhood. So thanks, Chuck. 
Charles Cerankosky: And then on the increase in working capital dollars spent during the quarter, does a lot of that simply reflect inflation? Or are you -- is Kroger, in fact, getting more aggressive on forward buying or just trying to grab stuff when it's available? 
Gary Millerchip: Chuck, yes, I think there's a couple of different factors just briefly in there. Overall, we've been on a plan for a number of years to continue to optimize working capital. So I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change in strategy. We're very focused on continuing to drive improvements there and have seen good tailwinds in our cash flow because of that. 
 This quarter, we would have seen an increase in inventory. Part of that would be to do with sort of starting to get back towards pre-COVID levels as the in-stock and supply chain improves. Nothing that would be concerning to us from a sell-through perspective, but we do think it's important to make sure we continue to improve the supply chain. And of course, inflation would have also impacted that number as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
W. McMullen: Thank you for -- to everyone for joining us today. I am incredibly proud of the way we are beginning in 2022, with a continued focus on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. 
 As always, I'd like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. First, obviously, thank you. The past several years have been challenging and weighed on all of us differently. While each of us react in a unique way, no one should have to struggle alone. That's why we offer a variety of resources, from in-person and virtual counseling sessions through our well-being assistant, to tools to help leaders of others foster a supportive environment. I would encourage each of us to take time to ensure we have the support systems we need in place. And if we don't, please ask for help. We are all our best advocates and know what truly we need. Thank you for everything you do for each other. Thank you for what you do for our customers every day. And thank you for what you do for our communities every day. I'm inspired every single day of the week by your amazing work that you do. 
 Thanks again for joining us today, and that concludes our first quarter earnings call. 
Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-03-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information.  
 We are excited to see that many of you will also be attending, either virtually or in person, our 2022 Business Update tomorrow in Florida when we will share additional details and answer questions about our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. More information about virtual registration for this event can be found at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, we would ask that you focus today's questions on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as our 2022 guidance. Now I will turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital propelled Kroger to record performance in 2021 on top of record results in 2020. We are incredibly proud of our associates who continued to deliver for our customers through the pandemic. During 2021, our team delivered for all stakeholders by, first of all, achieving positive year-over-year identicals without fuel against very strong identicals last year and a 2-year stack of 14.3%.  
 Also by connecting with customers through expanding our seamless ecosystem and remarkable, consistent delivery of full fresh and friendly customer experience for everyone, plus investing more than ever before in our associates to raise our average hourly rate to $17 and our average hourly rate to over $22 when you include [ compensation ] and benefits as well. We balance all of these investments by achieving cost savings of greater than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year, and alternative profits contributed an incremental $150 million of operating profit as well. 
 As we look to 2022, we expect the momentum in our business to continue, and we have confidence in our ability to navigate a rapidly changing operating environment. We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to build lasting competitive advantages. Our balanced model is allowing us to deliver for shareholders, invest in our associates, continue to provide fresh, affordable food for our customers and support for our communities.  
 We remain confident in our growth model and our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. Kroger is leading with fresh. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales, excluding fuel, during the fourth quarter. Kroger remains the #1 retailer in many exciting areas such as specialty cheese, sushi and floral. As the world's largest florist, we sold over 76 million floral stems for Valentine's Day alone. And the smiles that came along with that for our customers and associates were free.  
 We advanced our fresh strategy and strengthened our fresh offerings in 2021 by launching our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, supporting our commitment to small businesses. As a result of the launch, we have brought a number of new products to customers, and the initial results have exceeded our expectations. We are still early in the program, and we will continue to partner with small businesses to expand our pipeline of new products. We also remain a leader in innovation through exciting partnerships with companies like Kitchen United and Kipster. We've completed the initial test phase of our End-to-End Fresh initiatives focused on bringing more days of freshness to our customers and are confident in its scalability and with plans to expand to targeted stores across the country.  
 Our brands continue to resonate strongly with customers and maintains a culture of innovation, launching over 660 new items during the year. More than half of those new items were within our Simple Truth and Private Selection portfolios. We accelerated Home Chef's incredible milestone of becoming a billion-dollar brand, our fourth greater-than-$1 billion brand, which is pretty special. As a reminder for everyone, we merged with Home Chef in 2018. At the time, we knew our customers were looking for ways to make meal time easier without compromising on taste or freshness.  
 While Home Chef originated as a pure-play e-commerce offering, we saw immense potential to integrate and leverage it across our seamless ecosystem, scaling it within our stores and continuing to grow online. The success of this integration demonstrates our ability to integrate and scale solutions that provide value to our customers and grow our competitive moats.  
 Kroger is focused on delivering a seamless experience that requires 0 compromise by customers, and I think that's a really important point, 0 compromise required by customers. And what that means is the freshest products at competitive prices and flexible lead times. Yael will go into a lot more detail tomorrow on what 0 compromise means for our customers at our business update.  
 The strength in our top line sales in 2021 demonstrates our ability to meet our customers no matter how they choose to engage with us, whether it's in-store or online. At the same time, we are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger within all modalities.  
 We continue to attract new customers to our digital platforms. During the quarter, we saw new seamless pickup and delivery to household acquisitions increased 25% compared to the third quarter. We remain committed to doubling digital sales and profitability by 2023, which was announced in 2021. We look forward to sharing our glide path to this goal with you tomorrow. We do not expect digital growth will be linear, especially as we cycle the sales spike in 2020 and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again.  
 We are incredibly proud of the new digital modalities we launched during 2021, including Kroger Delivery Now, our Boost membership program and the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, all of which we expect to contribute meaningfully to our long-term goals. Yesterday, we announced a new customer fulfillment center for the Cleveland region, following on heels of our announcement of a cross-dock spoke facility that will serve Oklahoma City. And just a few weeks ago, we opened our third customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia and are leveraging learnings from Monroe and Groveland to drive efficiencies and scale in the new facility. Customers are loving this new offering, and we continue to be pleased with the initial rollout of our facilities in Groveland and Monroe, and we look forward to sharing additional insights tomorrow.  
 Now turning to the supply chain. Our teams across our stores, warehouses, plants and offices have been incredible in working together to supply fresh food and necessities for our customers while addressing the rapidly changing environment. During the quarter, industry challenges continued within the supply chain, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. Within our supply chain, we continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet. We are also partnering with our suppliers to improve product availability using the strength of our data science teams to provide insights that shorten lead times and optimize inventory flow across the extended supply chain.  
 We continue to focus on expanding our transportation contracts and attracting carriers from outside our industry, which has kept product flowing predictably across our network. The teams are doing a great job managing the increased costs, and the trends within our costs are improving sequentially. We are using our data and supplier data plus leveraging technology to support future growth. We expect the supply chain to continue to improve throughout the year as a result of our actions.  
 When I visit our stores, I often hear from our associates that what they love most about their job is that they can positively impact the lives of our customers, communities and each other every day. And it's also what I love about our business too. And it's what makes our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit, so vital for our people. One way we live our purpose is through progress toward our ESG goals and our commitments. As part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, last year, Kroger donated 499 million meals, that's right, 499 million meals, to feed hungry families across America. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 waste.  
 As part of our commitments to helping people live healthier lives, we've administrated almost 11 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine through Kroger Health. For our more than 450,000 associates, we strive to create a culture of opportunity, and we take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers.  
 As we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing more than ever before in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness as well as the continued investment in wages that I mentioned earlier. This is enabling us to navigate current labor conditions while continuing to provide America with the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem.  
 We are cultivating an environment where all associates are able to thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Kroger earned top score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's benchmark in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Last year alone, we provided more than $5 million to support associates through unexpected hardships through our Helping Hands Fund. This includes providing critical funds for disaster relief for nearly 1,300 associates.  
 2021 was an incredible year for Kroger, and we are committed to continued growth. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our relentless focus on learning and improving every day. I believe this has been a key on navigating our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And now I'd like to turn it over to Gary. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger continues to execute at a high level and is delivering exceptional results while navigating a rapidly changing environment. Before I get into our results in more detail, I would like to start by echoing Rodney's appreciation to our fantastic associates. Their dedication to serve our customers and support each other throughout the pandemic has been nothing short of incredible.  
 Our performance last year clearly highlights the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy as we achieved positive identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS growth on top of record results in 2020. We also continued to invest in our customers and associates to ensure Kroger is well positioned for future success. These investments were balanced with over $1 billion in cost savings and $150 million of incremental operating profit from alternative profit streams.  
 I will now provide additional color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.68 per diluted share, up 6% compared to last year. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were positive 0.2% and digital sales on a 2-year stacked basis grew by 113%. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.3 billion, up 6% over 2020. Gross margin was 22% of sales for 2021. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 43 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and strategic price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in alternative profits.  
 The OG&A rate decreased 61 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting a reduction in COVID-related costs and cost saving initiatives, partially offset by significant investments in our associates.  
 Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 4%, our strongest quarter of the year, with fresh departments leading the way. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same period last year. The stability in our gross margin rate reflects effective management of cost inflation and sourcing benefits, offset by strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 7 basis points. This was driven by significant investments in our associates, including a year-end associate thank you reward and various asset impairments, offset by decreased COVID-related costs, sales leverage and cost saving initiatives.  
 The LIFO charge for the fourth quarter was $20 million compared to an $84 million credit in the same period last year and represented an $0.11 headwind to EPS in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher inflation in most categories, with grocery and meat being the largest contributors. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to successfully navigate many different operating environments, and our team is doing an excellent job managing the current higher inflationary environment. We continue to leverage our data and work closely with our suppliers to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization.  
 Our brands is also an important differentiator for Kroger in this environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. Our strategic approach is helping our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and is allowing Kroger to maintain a strong price position relative to our key competitors.  
 Fuel also remains an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers, and we continue to invest in our fuel program in 2021. Customers that redeem fuel points spend, on average, 4x more at Kroger and visit 4x more frequently. Our investment in fuel rewards, which is reflected in our supermarket gross margin, also helps customers stretch their dollars further and allowed us to achieve gallon growth of 5% in the fourth quarter, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.30 this quarter versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.44 compared to $0.33 in the same quarter in 2020.  
 Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Our operating results generated exceptional free cash flow in 2021, which resulted in a further strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. We were also disciplined in accelerating the return of cash to shareholders in 2021. In total, Kroger returned $2.2 billion to investors via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  
 I'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our continued commitment to investing in our associates and our deep experience with collective bargaining. Wages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. As you know, we committed to significant associate wage investments when we launched our Restock Kroger program at the end of 2017. Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate wages and training over the last 4 years. In addition, we have committed to invest over $1.8 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates.  
 Wage, health care and pensions are included in all of the more than 350 collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 66% of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by our professional labor relations team. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable health care for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities that we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business. If negotiations do become contentious, we have contingency plans in place to continue to support our communities.  
 During the fourth quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Fred Meyer, King Soopers and our Michigan division, covering more than 20,500 associates. For 2022, we have contract negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Las Vegas, Southern California, Seattle, Indianapolis, Portland, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Chicago and Toledo, in addition to continued negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock and Memphis. We are actively proposing generous wage increases over the life of the various contracts we are negotiating, and these increases are included in our financial model and our guidance for 2022.  
 We are also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with unrealistic proposals, proposals that do not balance associate investments with keeping groceries affordable for our customers is untenable and undermines our shared goal of growing the company to create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates.  
 In closing, let me now provide additional color on the 2022 guidance that we released this morning. While we recognize there remain a number of uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical outlook, we believe the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy and our ability to manage multiple levers within our financial model will allow us to continue to build momentum within our business in 2022. We have shared previously that we expect to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and our guidance for 2022 creates a new baseline for FIFO net operating profit that is some $900 million higher than the midpoint of our TSR model would have projected when we announced it in 2019.  
 Our plans contemplate meaningful investments in associate hourly rates as well as investments in delivering greater value for our customers and enhancing our digital capabilities. We expect these investments and the impact of cycling COVID-19 vaccine revenue will be fully offset by tailwinds in our model and allow us to grow adjusted net earnings per diluted share to between $3.75 and $3.85.  
 The tailwinds in our 2022 plan includes sales leverage from growing identical sales without fuel between 2% and 3%. We also expect to deliver cost savings of $1 billion, incremental alternative profit growth largely in line with 2021 and underlying improvement in Kroger Health profitability, excluding vaccine income. Fuel profitability is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as gallon growth is offset by slightly lower fuel margins.  
 In terms of quarterly cadence for identical sales of our fuel and EPS growth, we expect identical sales without fuel in quarter 1 and quarter 2 will be above the midpoint of our 2% to 3% range as we expect heightened inflation will continue in the first half of the year. We would expect our second half identical sales without fuel to be below the midpoint of our range as we expect the inflation to moderate later in the year as we cycle higher inflation from the second half of 2021. Regarding adjusted EPS, we would expect quarter 1 to be above the annual growth rate range of 2% to 5%, quarter 2 to be below the range and the second half of the year to be within the range.  
 Turning briefly to our capital priorities. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation. As you heard this morning, we are increasing capital investments to $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2022. This reflects some catch-up from the last 2 years, where spend was below original guidance due to COVID-related constraints as well as an acceleration of our strategic initiatives that will drive longer-term earnings growth. At the same time, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And consistent with our TSR model, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by the acceleration in share buybacks over the last 6 months.  
 And finally, we are looking forward to spending more time with you at our business update tomorrow when you will hear from key members of our leadership team about our strategic priorities and our path to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we have a variety of levers and growth opportunities to continue to build on this strength. As we reflect on 2021, we are incredibly proud of our ability to navigate both a rapidly changing operating environment and evolving customer behaviors.  
 We are obviously in an inflationary environment. Our teams are managing it well. And as Gary talked about, we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for customers, including our award-winning customer rewards program, which includes fuel rewards, our amazing and high-quality Our Brands products and personalized offers and savings for each customer individualized.  
 As we look to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves, serve our customers in new and exciting ways and continue to change the definition of what it means to be a grocery retailer while never losing sight of what's most important to our customers. And when we do this, we have a clear path to delivering on our commitment of 8% to 11% total shareholder returns over time for our shareholders.  
 Now we look forward to your questions. As Rob shared at the top of the call, we would like to focus all questions on our quarter 4 and full year 2021 results as well as 2022 guidance. We look forward to sharing additional details about our long-term strategy tomorrow at our 2022 Business Update. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Congrats on a really strong quarter. So I guess just starting out, just on the gross margin line, pretty significant improvement in gross margins on a 1- and 2-year basis. What are the key changes? Maybe some more color in terms of what drove that improvement versus what we saw in Q2 and Q3. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and Rodney covered in a moment ago, really proud of the team in the way that we managed the business in Q4 and some of the changes that were happening. From I think what the team did, we're obviously laser-focused on how can we continue to be effective in managing the sourcing approach to how we are leveraging the relationships with our suppliers and using our data.  
 We've been very effective in using our personalization and promotional activities to really sort of target the offers to the customer to make sure that they're seeing the value but that we're also then able to manage those cost increases effectively in the business. 
 I think mix is also another important trend that the team is really focused on is how do we ensure that we're upselling customers to better quality products and premiumized products and whether it's adding the cedar plank to the salmon or the seasoning to the shrimp. And some of those opportunities are really important in how the merchandising team are really focused on recognizing some consumer trends in how many of our customers are moving to more meal solutions as well as continuing to look value -- look for value.  
 So overall, we feel really good around the way the team managed our gross margin during the quarter. As we think about going forward into 2022, we continue to focus on, of course, the same elements and continue to manage those pieces tightly while also wanting to make sure we're continuing to deliver value for our customers. And I think to us, really, we look at it more of how do we manage the model overall across gross margin, OG&A and pulling the different levers.  
 And certainly, I think we look at 2022 and think that we'll continue to invest in the customer. We'll continue to manage those different levers. I would suspect that we'll see continued investment in gross margin in 2022 and continued operating leverage in OG&A. But I think the fourth quarter is a good example of where we wouldn't expect to see some of the major volatility or the gap in gross margin and OG&A that we saw across the whole year, for example, in 2021. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. During COVID, as we've mentioned several times, people have learned how to cook again. And what they're finding is that they can have restaurant-quality food that they prepare at home. And in numerous categories like the specialty cheese that I mentioned, but there's numerous categories where customers have traded up to higher-quality product. And everything that we're seeing, they continue with that. And the other thing, I think, that's always important to remind all of us is that our fresh departments grew faster than the center store departments. And our fresh departments have a higher gross rate as well versus the center store. So just a couple of additional things. Thanks, Rupesh. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe just one follow-up. So with a lot of inflation out there in the marketplace, how do your price gaps look today versus maybe where they were a few quarters ago? 
W. McMullen: If you look at overall, it's pretty close to the cost increases we've incurred. If you look at -- in a couple of departments strategically, it's not -- the retail price hasn't increased as much as cost, and we've been able to balance all of those pieces. But we really are using our data to make sure that we understand the elasticity of everything. 
 We are starting to see customers engaging in coupons a little bit more aggressive than before and doing other things in terms of starting to move to our brands where they don't have to compromise on quality and they can save money as well. So we are starting to see the beginning of some behavior changes as well, but really early. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe the only thing to add, Rodney. Certainly, as you know, Rupesh, the customer, as we look at our data, defines value in multiple ways. So part of it is the everyday price, part of it is the promotions. It includes our fuel rewards and all the personalization that we offer. And I would say, if we look at our position as we end the year from where we started, we feel very good about the way in which we've been able to deliver value for the customer. And when we look at our price position, we feel we've been able to maintain a very strong position with the customer in terms of how they would perceive the value of the Kroger basket and the value that Kroger's delivering. 
Operator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: A nice quarter and guide. My question is the comp guide is solid for next year. And we're a little surprised at how good the EBIT flow-through or the margin still looks, given all the cost pressures on the wage side. You mentioned some things on the gross margin. You mentioned tailwinds, but I wanted to put it to you holistically and hear your reaction to this question. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary get into some more of the details. I think one of the things that's -- to me, your question is great. But the thing that I think is really important to remember is the things that we continue to do to take costs out of our system all across everything. And we would expect to be able to take another $1 billion of cost out. And as you know, last year, we took over $1 billion out and that was the fourth consecutive year. 
 So through process change and really, it's becoming a capability that the organization has, that's really critical to be able to afford to do some of the things that we're doing. The other thing is alternative profit and some of the other things related to that continues to change the fundamental business model in a positive way, that inflation doesn't affect the same way and the profitability of that part of the business is significantly higher than the traditional grocery store would be as well. Gary, any additional stuff? 
Gary Millerchip: Well, I think you summarized it well, Rodney. I think, Simeon, we feel about it as you look at our 2021 results and then you think about our guidance '22, it really demonstrates the strength in that, the overall diversity of our model now and the different levers that we're able to pull to make sure that we're investing in our associates, investing in our customers and still able to deliver a strong return for our shareholders. 
 And we would agree with you that 2022 is a year where we do expect to make significant investments, whether it's around continuing to support the customer and drive growth in our business, investing in our associates, investing in digital. And of course, we will be cycling some COVID vaccine revenue that will be lower in 2022 than '21. But Rodney mentioned the cost savings and alternative profit benefits that we see within the model. We do continue to expect, obviously, to generate sales leverage in our model as well. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, health and wellness will certainly have some headwinds from COVID vaccines, but we believe there's continued opportunity to improve the underlying profitability in health and wellness as well in 2022. 
Simeon Gutman: And maybe related, the value-conscious customer, are you seeing any signs of trade down? Are you seeing customers trade out? Are you seeing any decisions in the store that lead you to see that the customer is feeling a little more pinched? 
W. McMullen: Yes. What the customers are telling us is that they're changing their spend behavior outside of food more than food, which obviously makes sense. They also have found that eating at home is a lot more affordable than going out to restaurants. They're able to stretch their budget this way -- that way as well.
 And as I mentioned a second ago, we are seeing people starting to engage in coupons and some of those things a little more than before. But nothing substantial so far, and we really feel good about the way we're positioned with the customer. And if you look at our connection to that customer segment, it actually improved in the fourth quarter versus prior year. And what customers are finding is our fresh departments are a huge strength, and then they're able to get personalized rewards and engage with us on promotional items and things like that. 
Operator: The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with, if you look at the $1 billion of cost takeout, right, how does that roughly break out between COGS and O&A? And how has that changed over the last 3 or 4 years? Has it shifted more to O&A or it stayed relatively consistent? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- if you look at overall, it would be more cost-driven. Now goods not for resale, do you put it in cost or do you put in COGS because you can argue either one. But it's more driven by process change and eliminating work. Obviously, sourcing is an important component of it. Goods not for resale is incredibly important as well. If you look at the mix, the mix has been pretty consistent over the last 4 years. If you look at our expectations for 2022, Gary, it would be pretty similar to 2021. I mean, it might be 5% difference but not much, right? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. No, I think the only thing, John, that's really accelerated over the last couple of years, I completely agree with Rodney around the sourcing benefits and the taking cost out of the operation. The one thing that, as you know, we've talked about is we invested in digital to ensure that we're winning the customer to build that $10 billion business that we talked about. And we did that sometimes, recognizing that there'll be some inefficiency in our model. 
 And so I think one of the areas that we've been able to accelerate is taking cost out of the digital sort of cost to serve a customer, if you like, as we can leverage more efficiency in that scale. And that's become a tailwind this year and will be -- or was last year and will be in 2022 as part of the cost structure. That's probably the one area that's maybe changed a little bit over the last couple of years, but I completely agree with Rodney. On the balance, it's pretty consistent. 
W. McMullen: John, Gary's last point to me is incredibly important. And everybody on the call, you've all heard us talk about job 1 is don't lose the customer as they switch to being a combination of digital and in-store. And then over time, we'll figure out a way to make that customer just as profitable as a customer that traditionally shopped in the store. So I think Gary's last point is really important. 
John Heinbockel: And then maybe talk about the how fuel rewards performs in an environment where price per gallon may be approaching $4, right? How it performs? And then do you do anything differently? I don't think the plan -- the program construct would change. But does it -- or does your marketing change? Because you would think in this environment, fuel rewards is way more important than it was a year or 2 ago? 
W. McMullen: Your belief and comment is correct. What we find is customers find it very helpful and as fuel prices go up, they engage in the fuel rewards more. Obviously, we continue to leverage fuel rewards in ways that make sense for different customer segments because different segments engage differently in fuel rewards. Obviously, we would prefer for fuel not to be at $3 or $4 a gallon, but we're going to do everything we can to help the customer stretch their budget as much as we can. 
Operator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just want to follow up on the FIFO adjusted gross margins for a minute. Did you see any change in the competitive environment that allowed you to pass through more costs? We know that Walmart's U.S. gross margins were up 54 basis points last quarter. So curious if that provided an opening for you guys. And then should we look at the 4Q performance as a good run rate for 2022? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The first part of that, I wouldn't say that we saw it really change any differently. Obviously, Walmart is one competitor but there's numerous competitors out there. And what we're trying to do is to make sure that we're balancing inflation and helping the customers stretch their budget as much as we can. And we've continued to invest in pricing in areas that matter most to customers. So we really are -- we wouldn't consider it easier or harder. It's just part of the overall managing the business. In terms of looking forward, Gary, I'll let you answer that part. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Spencer, as you know, we don't tend to give detailed guidance on the puts and takes in gross margin rate and OG&A rate because we much more view it as how do we manage the business as a whole to drive sustainable earnings growth. I would say that I mentioned it in one of the earlier responses, that we would expect to continue to invest in the customer in 2022. And we'd also actually expect to see some accelerated advertising costs too because we're going to obviously continue to grow the business and we'll talk about it tomorrow, some of the digital growth opportunities that we're focused on as well. 
 So I think as we look at the total year, we still expect some investment in gross margin in 2022, but we'd also continue to expect to see significant OG&A leverage as well in many areas through the cost savings that Rodney mentioned. And certainly, we wouldn't expect the gap between those 2 to be anywhere near as wide as it was when you look at the full year results in 2021. So I wouldn't take the fourth quarter as the sort of the number to use, but I would certainly expect us to be tightly managing those. And we do believe, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all the work the team has done around sourcing, connecting with customers, driving our strategy to deliver value for customers gives us confidence in the overall guidance that we shared for next year. 
Spencer Hanus: Got it, that's helpful. And then fuel profitability is up significantly versus 2019 despite the rising prices, which is typically a headwind to that -- to profitability. So I understand that you expect profitability to be down this year a little bit. But how sustainable do you think it is, this step-up versus '19? And then could you just remind us how much operating profit the fuel business contributed in 4Q just so we can better back into how the core performed? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes, it's a great question on fuel. As you know, we talk about this each year, and we used to base our assumptions on a sort of a 3- to 5-year trend. And if you look at the last 3 to 5 years, really, fuel profitability has continued to improve pretty consistently as we look at the trends in our business and how our fuel reward program is connecting and what a great job our team has done in managing fuel margins. I do think there's a little bit of left pocket, right pocket in some of that, of course, as well because we spend a tremendous amount of money in rewarding customers, giving up to over $1 a gallon off for discount for customers that are highly engaged in the program. 
 So I think it's important to remember that there are 2 dimensions to it, and we recognize that in our gross margin on the supermarket business and don't flow through on the fuel side because the redemption of those points is tied to when you spend at Kroger in the store online, not tied to specifically the fuel usage. So that's an important factor to remember. 
 We believe that the fuel business has sustained improvement in profitability, so we're less focused on the historical trends now because we believe the industry has changed structurally. And we'd expect that to be maintained for us and also because of the strength in our value proposition with the customer. We don't specifically call out details on fuel and total profitability. I would say that actually, broadly speaking, the tailwind on fuel in the fourth quarter largely align with the headwind in LIFO, so the 2 of those pretty much offset each other during the quarter. 
W. McMullen: One other thing on fuel that our team -- 2 or 3 years ago, we restructured our procurement team in fuel, and they've also made progress relative to the market on cost of goods, which has been helpful for that business as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: How much did inflation contribute to IDs in 4Q? And how much do you expect inflation to contribute to IDs in a year ahead? And as part of that, it does look like you're expecting IDs to still be positive in the second half of the year. Does that mean you expect this total number of new occasions in the second half of the year, number of new occasions at home, to remain positive? 
W. McMullen: If you look at -- as Gary mentioned, we would expect inflation in the second half of the year to moderate just because it's cycling the inflation from the second half of this year -- or last year, I guess, now. Overall, as you know, we operate successfully in every operating environment, whether it's inflationary or deflationary. And we're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our customers. 
 If you look at overall, we would expect the business to continue to grow. And part of that is really the seamless ecosystem. Altogether, what we're finding is we get a bigger part of their overall household spend. We also -- if you look at total households, we had good numbers on total households for the fourth quarter versus 2020 and 2019. And we would -- and what we find is that once we get a new customer, we're able to move them up the loyalty ladder over time because of the experience they get from our associates on the customer experience, the seamless ecosystem, fresh and good value, plus we're able to start personalized rewards for them. So we would expect to be able to move those new customers up the loyalty ladder, which would help -- be helpful in identicals as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: No, I think you covered it well. 
Michael Lasser: My follow-up question is, Rodney, the percentage of gross units that are on promotion is still about 500 basis points below where it was prior to the pandemic. And prior to the pandemic, that metric for the industry has been very consistent over time. So why is it that the industry is just going to be less promotional moving forward than it has been in the past? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Relative to the industry, I wouldn't have as much detail on that. If you look at our revenue, our sales on promotion, it's pretty much very similar today as it was before the pandemic. It's really -- it's something we track every week or whatever. During the pandemic, there were promotions we didn't do just because there were some items you couldn't get product. And obviously, you don't want to promote an item where you don't have enough inventory to support the product. In some cases, that's still the case. But overall, our promotional activity is pretty similar to what it was before the pandemic. 
Gary Millerchip: I think, Michael, just to add that I think that Rodney's comments are really what causes us to believe that when we talk to our customers and look at our data, we feel we're in a very good position relative to the value that customers receiving from Kroger in this environment and our ability to continue to deliver value for our customers and maintain a strong perception as customers continue to evolve into 2022 and beyond. 
W. McMullen: And one of the things that I think it's important to remember, we would track internally on sales on promotion, not items on promotion. So it's volume weighted as well, I think, is an important point too. 
Operator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: I wanted to ask you about labor because you brought it up on the call. But can you just provide a little bit more color on sort of like what's going on, on the labor front right now? I mean, you have a very strong history of being fair, right? Like I think if we take an objective view here, that seems to be the case. But as we saw with Denver, these renewals now can be costly and there are other big contracts coming up. I guess how has the dialogue been? It does seem like you're poised to see some acceleration of inflation. I wonder if you agree with that and if you can quantify. And then what are you doing to offset that pressure, things like automation, in addition to some of the cost save stuff? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, when we embarked upon Restock Kroger several years ago, we made the commitment that we would accelerate our associate wages. And as Gary mentioned, now we -- incrementally, it's about $1.2 billion per year that we are investing in supporting our associates. We think supporting our associates is incredibly important. And what we're always trying to do is to make sure that we have solid wages, strong wages and industry-leading benefits, which we do have and making sure that we're keeping food affordable for customers. 
 And it's a balance that we're always trying to do. Obviously, we work with the unions, but it's -- we want to make sure that our business is sustainable for the long term and we're creating jobs long term and we're creating career opportunities. And if you look at our store directory, 70% started out as an hourly associate. If you look at department heads, almost all started out as hourly part-time associates, and those are things that are incredibly important. 
 So it's obviously a balance. We've strategically, several years ago, decided to invest more in wages because we thought it was important to do. And what we find is, over time, it also reduces turnover. And when you have turnover reduction, obviously, the productivity of somebody that's been working for us for a couple of years is higher than a new hire. 
 It really gets back to the cost saves that Gary and I both talked about. Literally, you're looking for every single thing where you can stock something in a different way because if you save a second across our company, it's about $14 million. So it's -- you're looking for every single thing that you can do anywhere in the store, anywhere in a plant or a warehouse to be able to eliminate waste. And we believe that we have a core competency now on how to do that. And those are things that are allowing us to make the investments in our associate wages. I think, Gary, over the last, what, 4 years, our average hourly rate is up 22%. And we've been able to obviously do that at the same time on significantly lowering our OG&A expense. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Maybe just a couple of things to add, Rodney. When Rodney talked about the last 4 years and the investment we've made, I wouldn't think of that as being the end of the journey when we announced our TSR model. We were actually fully expecting, as we look out towards 2025, that we will continue to invest in our associates and our model when we announced the TSR model of 8% to 11% growth. We actually did expect that we would continue to invest not just over '18, '19 and '20 but continue to invest '21 through 2025. 
 So it's always been something that we contemplated in our model. We kind of felt that this was something that would come. And now admittedly, the last 12 months obviously have changed the landscape a little bit. So I would say we've pulled forward some of that thinking. And we would fully expect within our guidance that we've shared, 2022 will be a higher number in wage investments than 2021 was. So we are fully contemplating that with the guidance that we shared, and we expect that growth in wage to continue. And again, it was fully part of our TSR model. 
 We'll talk a little bit about tomorrow. But to Rodney's point, one of the reasons that we're increasing our capital investments in 2022 beyond the sort of catch-up of some of the things that were slowed down by COVID is we are going to be investing more in technology. We still feel like as proud as we are of the $1 billion-plus we've saved for the last 4 years, we still think there's a lot of opportunity to use technology even more effectively to take more cost out of the business. And it's one of the reasons that we're accelerating capital because we believe it will help support -- continue to increase efficiency over the next few years as we continue to invest in average hourly rates. And Mary Ellen Adcock will share a little bit more color on that when we see you tomorrow as well. 
Operator: Your next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. 
Michael Montani: The first question I had was just around the ID sales that you reported. I was wondering if you could discuss what kind of cost increases you all were seeing in terms of a percentage and how much you were able to pass through. And then also what your outlook would be for that same basis for 2022? 
W. McMullen: If you look within the quarter, it was pretty consistent. Obviously, you'll have -- in the fourth quarter especially, you'll have some weather that drives it. If you look at so far this quarter, it would look pretty similar to last -- to the fourth quarter on IDs. Overall, on cost increases, for the most part, they were passed through but not every area within the department. So it's really balancing all of the different pieces in terms of cost increases and trying to minimize the impact on the customer. 
Michael Montani: And then I guess just the outlook for '22, like if we look at the U.S. FDA, they're calling for, I think, 2.5% to 3.5% full year inflation for this year. Is that a good benchmark for us to use without any better information, would you say? 
W. McMullen: Well, yes, we would be using the same data source. But we would expect within the year, it would be meaningfully higher in the first half versus the second half. But somebody on Gary's team probably have gotten a PhD on the amount of time that he's spent on trying to estimate inflation. And at the end of the day, you basically end up in that spot.
 We would expect SNAP, just a pure number of SNAP households, to be a headwind. But what we find on SNAP is some people switch to buying items with credit card, cash and other things as well. And the other piece of our guidance would reflect in our health and wellness business. There's some third-party plans that weren't profitable that we also are going to move away from or have moved away from that's impacted our number on our guidance as well. 
Gary Millerchip: The only other thing I would add that -- Rodney shared this earlier in the Q&A, but we are seeing customers tell us that as inflation is certainly higher in food, which obviously we're all focused on, but inflation is obviously higher pretty much everywhere in the economy right now. And actually, whereas maybe a few months ago, customers were telling us they were eating more food at home because of concerns around COVID, some of that shifted more to -- while food at home inflation is higher, actually relative to other inflation and how I need to manage my budget, food at home is more attractive in terms of helping me be able to manage my budget and manage my dollars. 
 So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of factors that are impacting that outlook that we're obviously using the best information we can to forecast and feel good about the guidance that we've shared and our ability to manage different levers if things change. But we recognize our crystal ball isn't perfect and we'll just continue to be dynamic in the way we manage it. 
Michael Montani: Great. And just the follow-up question in terms of expense outlook was in light of the $1 billion-plus of gross cost-out, is there a certain kind of ID sales level that you would need probably to leverage that you could discuss? And how much vaccine contribution did you have in '21 that needs to cycle now in '22? 
W. McMullen: As Gary mentioned on the vaccines, that is something we factored into the guidance overall and it's just part of the total puzzle. We would also expect some of that to be offset because we're able to provide more of the regular vaccines that we always have. And some of that focus that went on vaccines, we'll be able to acquire additional customers to offset some of that. So all of that is factored into the guidance we gave. On the identical sales, right now, as long as we can continue to get the cost out, we're able to leverage a pretty modest amounts of identical in terms of being able to leverage. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, there's lots of puts and takes, as you heard us mention in our 2022 guidance overall, and we would expect there to be cost increases, obviously, from our investment in average hourly wage. And we continue to invest in the customer experience. But overall, factoring in all the elements of our model, we would expect to generate leverage and our OG&A rate would improve in 2022 over 2021 based on all the different pieces coming together in our model. So within 2022, specifically with that 2% to 3% IDs, we would expect to be able to improve the OG&A rate in the year. 
Operator: This will be our last question, and it comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I'll make it quick. Just to build on Ed's question. Can you elaborate a bit, if possible, on how we should think about the risk of labor this year? I was struck a little bit by how much time Gary spent on the subject and a little bit of the tone. It kind of felt like a warning to investors, frankly. So if there's any data you can provide on what percentage of your workers are up for renegotiation this year or whatever metric is appropriate, that would be great. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor overall, it's something that we're proud. We're one of the largest union employers in the United States. And we're focused on providing additional -- we go in with the ability and assumption that we're going to continue to invest in our associates. And we have industry-leading benefits and we support their ability to come for a job and make it a career by feeding your future, providing tuition reimbursement and other things to help people continue to achieve a career. 
 So we're always balancing all of the pieces. So our associates are critical to our future success. We invest in our associates and I want to make sure that we have a strong, sustainable business so that they're able to support their families as well. And there's nothing more inspiring than when you're in a store and somebody talks about -- the other day, I was at Ralph's and somebody was talking about how they were able to send 4 of their kids to college and 1 was a doctor and 1 was an attorney. And those are the kind of things that is incredibly inspiring to hear our associates talk about. 
Gary Millerchip: And Ken, I think just one thing to add. We are obviously trying to listen to feedback carefully, and we've got a sense that there was a desire to hear more about our overall strategy. As we shared in the prepared comments, we feel really good about the investments we have made and are continuing to make in our associates. And we have a team that's very experienced in managing those relationships. But we wanted to make sure, as we had some feedback that you'd like more color, that we try and listen to investor feedback and wanted to make sure we addressed that in the prepared remarks. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Ken. Thank you all for attending today's call. We look forward to engaging with all of you again tomorrow at our business update in Florida. As I always do, I would like to conclude our call by taking a moment to address our associates who many listen in. I'm extremely proud of the things we have accomplished this year and we celebrated many significant milestones. Thank you on behalf of all our team for making Kroger better every day. I'm so proud of you. 
 As America's grocer, Kroger is taking action to show our support and solidarity with Ukraine. Today, we are sending emergency food assistance to support refugees through a grant from the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation to the UN World Food Program Ukraine Emergency Fund. We will match all gifts made by our associates and customers up to $250,000. That concludes our earnings -- fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you. And as I said before, we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow. Take care. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2021-12-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rob Quast: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. Our press release and supplemental information regarding the quarter can be found on our website at ir.kroger.com. 
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would also like to announce that we will be hosting a business update on March 4, 2022, in Florida with an opportunity to tour our recently opened Kroger delivery customer fulfillment center. We hope that you are able to join us. 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you for joining us today. We often say the holidays are our time to shine. And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. 
 Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. 
 With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of their holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. 
 We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. 
 And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. 
 We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers. 
 Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations. 
 Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. 
 And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year. 
 Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. 
 Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. 
 We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. 
 As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. 
 One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. 
 With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future. 
 Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. 
 Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS result. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. 
 I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call. With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. 
 Gross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. 
 Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. 
 The operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. 
 Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. 
 Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. 
 I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment. And during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. 
 We are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty. We also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality. 
 Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. 
 Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. 
 As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. 
 During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year. 
 Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. 
 In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. 
 I'll now turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger's strong year-to-date results are the outcome of our customer obsession, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life and our commitment to bringing fresh, affordable food to everyone. The strength of our teams have never been more apparent. With every new challenge, they raised to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight. Our team is bringing our competitive moats to life. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. 
Robert Moskow: You've obviously done a very good job of passing on inflation to consumers while shielding that at the same time. Your gross profit dollars are up now. Can you talk a little bit about what came -- what drove that outperformance versus your expectations last quarter? Because last quarter, I think you were pretty cautious on gross margin. 
 And then secondly, I think there's another big tranche of pricing coming in January from a lot of your vendors. How would you characterize that next tranche? Is it an unusually high acceleration? Or is it just kind of a continued acceleration similar to what you've seen so far? Maybe if you could even put it into context of CPI for us, it would be helpful. 
W. McMullen: Okay. Rob, I'll start, and I'll let Gary get into more of the details. First of all, I think it's important to remember what's allowing us to continue to invest in the customer and value is the great work our team is doing on cost reductions. And as Gary mentioned, we're on track to take $1 billion of cost out, and this is the fourth year in a row that we've been able to accomplish that, which really gives us the flexibility to be able to continue to invest in our customers. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. 
 If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand, and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's -- in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands which has amazing quality as well. 
 So with that, Gary, I'll let you get into more -- some more of the details for Rob. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Rob. Yes. I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing, and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. In Q3, we've continued to do that. 
 Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think, for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and OG&A metrics because, as Rodney mentioned there, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. 
 So I think it's a dynamic environment we continue to manage. I think somewhere between the Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. 
 So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time. 
Robert Moskow: And just a quick follow-up. I think Rodney said that you're seeing your inflation kind of leveling off. Are you looking at like PPI inflation there? Because I would agree with you, it seems like in the low teens, it's leveling off. Is that what you're looking at? 
W. McMullen: Yes. We would be looking at more of our own costs in terms of what we're incurring and what we see coming forward. And one of the other things that I always think it's important to remind people, we manufacture a lot of our own products, so we also understand the raw materials themselves and what's going on there. And we would be looking at CPI and PPI both. But in terms of trying to estimate inflation, we would be looking at our actual cost increases that we're incurring. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Rodney, I'm glad you mentioned the fact that you make your own products because that's a good lead into one of my questions, which is we're still seeing, at least in the scanner data that we get, some pretty poor trends on top of last year's poor trends for store brands in general. I'm not talking about Kroger. I'm talking across the measured industry. And I'm just hoping for an update for what you're seeing there. I know you've talked about this a little bit in the past, but are there any signs of improvement from that? And again, I know you're somewhat agnostic you'll make money either way. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the outlook is, what you're seeing, any updates from your side. 
W. McMullen: If you look at our brands, if you look at the third quarter trends, they were better than the second quarter trends. And if you look within the quarter, it improved during the trends. 
 Ken, the point you made is, for us, we want to make sure we have the products customers want. So a Kroger brand item has to earn its right on the shelf, just like any other brand. But for us, it's obviously one of our competitive moats. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and we did a press release earlier in the quarter, we were proud that Home Chef became our fourth brand on -- that is over $1 billion a year. Our brands, for us, is incredibly important on our connection with our customers because it's an incredible great value for our customers with amazing quality. And when you look at Simple Truth and Private Selection, both of those brands offer something that's unique in the marketplace and continue to grow aggressively. Private Selection, most of the items are things that you can't get somewhere else, and Simple Truth just makes it super easy for a customer to eat healthy. So the trends are improving. But for us, it is an incredibly important part of our overall strategic strategy and a competitive moat. 
Kenneth Goldman: And then quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that you're not passing on cost increases fully in either certain categories or certain products. Is it safe to assume that, like many of your peers, you're a little more hesitant to take pricing up on items that draw people into stores on a regular basis, things like milk and bread, et cetera? Or is it a little more strategic and nuanced than that? Just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about which items to take pricing up on and which not. 
W. McMullen: Yes. We would be using our data and our historical data over the last several years on elasticity by category and by products within categories on deciding what to pass through or not. We would also -- just on certain products, it's an opportunity to create deeper loyalty, some of which is obvious, some of which is not. And some of the items in the past wouldn't have the same amount of penetration across households as what they used to do. So it really is dynamic information that's based on what's going on right now in the market. 
 The other thing just to -- our data would also show in different parts of the country some of those elasticities would be different. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: No. I think you've covered it well. 
W. McMullen: Okay. Thanks, Ken. 
Operator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Michael Kessler: This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Can you hear me? 
W. McMullen: Yes. 
Michael Kessler: First, I wanted to ask about any initial thoughts, if you have any, on 2022, another good quarter in Q3. It looks like the full year is going to end up basically a retention or maybe slight growth off of 2021 on earnings. So I guess any more confidence or conviction that next year could be another, call it, algo type of year on both IDs and EBIT? And I guess any puts and takes as you're starting to think through that outlook? 
W. McMullen: It's a good question, and we appreciate it. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more detail when we get out to our March Investor Day. That's really when we'll go into depth. We're in the middle of going through -- developing our budgets and partnering with our Board on our 2022 expectations. The only comment that I would give in depth is, as we shared in our Investor Day in 2019 and we've continually updated, over time, we would expect a TSR of 8% to 11% on an annualized basis, made up of earnings growth and free cash flow, made up -- and returning cash to shareholders. 
 So overall, we would expect that. We do feel good about the momentum in the business in terms of the connections with the customer, our seamless business processes on identifying ways to take cost out, so we can invest some of those cost savings in our associate wages, cost savings and the customer connection and other things. So -- and the business continues to generate good cash flow. 
 Gary, it looks like you want to say something. 
Gary Millerchip: Well, I think you said it well, Rodney. I would just add where you were going. I think we're -- hopefully, we've been conveying very clearly, while we won't be getting into detailed guidance for 2022 because that's the first of March meeting, we've been trying to be clearing all of that communication, I think, around the confidence we have in the long-term prospects of the business, so not specific to '22, but thinking as we're continuing to build the business from the base that we've established through COVID that the opportunity to grow and deliver on that TSR commitment that Rodney mentioned. And specifically, we do believe that some of the food-at-home trends that we've talked a lot about. We've said for some time and continue to believe that data shows that a number of those changes will be structural in nature, and we'll continue to see sustained trends in food at home. 
 I think if you look at our performance over the last 2 years that Rodney was alluding to some of the individual drivers, but I think it's demonstrated in our mind the confidence in the value creation model that we're creating, the balance in our model to be able to drive sustainable growth. And the alternative profit stream is continuing to grow at double digits off a higher base. So certainly, I would endorse Rodney's comment more broadly around that commitment to TSR over time. But obviously, we'll get into more details on 2022 in March. 
Simeon Gutman: And it's Simeon for the follow-up. I thought maybe Michael might have a better shot at the '22 question than me. But my follow-up is on the puts and takes on IDs. It looks like it held pretty consistent, Q2 to Q3, and you talked about inflation lifting but leveling. Can you talk about anything, puts and takes sequentially got worse or better in terms of units, traffic, et cetera? 
W. McMullen: If you look at most pieces, it would -- third quarter would have been better than second quarter. If you look at household trends, if you look at -- basket size would have been a little bit smaller but not significantly. We continue to see people -- premiumization during both the quarter. We continue to see people buying larger pack sizes on just about every category. So when you look at the puts and takes, I think there's as many puts and takes. 
Gary Millerchip: Maybe just to add, Rodney. Yes, Simeon, I mean, the trends were pretty consistent through the quarter in Q3. They got slightly better as the quarter went on, and we would be trending at the top end of the range that we shared in the quarter-to-date so far, top end of the range that we shared for guidance for Q4. And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of -- we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year, and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. 
 I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4 that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market. And it will be those kind of things that, for us, would be the puts and takes in how strong Q4 plays out in our mind. 
Operator: The next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. 
Robert Ohmes: I guess, Gary, for you, could you -- I wanted to just follow up on the sourcing benefits to gross margin. Can you remind us what you're doing to achieve kind of sourcing benefits in this environment? And also, you're doing an amazing job with the cost savings initiatives, offsetting labor and other cost pressures. Can you remind us also there, what you've been doing? And maybe some thoughts on how sustainable those 2 things could be into next year? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. We're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Kroger. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us, and I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. 
 On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure you're consolidating all the buying in the right places, so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. 
 So it continues to evolve for us, and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings. And we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.
 On the sort of the OG&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers, so taking that non-value-added work out wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning-type processes. 
 One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. 
 And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learnings through COVID on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. 
 So I hope that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really become embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average hourly rate for associates, to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer while at the same time growing shareholder returns. 
W. McMullen: Robbie, the only other thing I would add to Gary's comments, and it's implied throughout Gary's comments, but we have done a lot of people changes -- talent changes, both in terms of recruiting people from within the company but external as well outside of the industry that have skills that were different than traditional in our industry, which has been a huge help in both areas for us to think about things in new ways and for people to approach things in new ways as well. 
Robert Ohmes: That's great. That's really helpful. And one really quick follow-up question, if I may. With the changes you're making on the sourcing side and with own brands, can -- what is happening with total SKUs versus national brands SKUs versus owned brands SKUs in your stores? Are they shrinking? Are some growing? Can you give us any color on that? 
W. McMullen: If you look at before COVID, the number of SKUs would be lower now than before, just because it's -- you don't have as much change time and things like that. There are selective areas where some of the national players haven't reintroduced some of the variety that we are introducing some of that variety in our own brands, and we introduced over 200 new SKUs in the quarter, and we would have an aggressive pipeline going forward. 
 But overall, if you look at -- there's still continued SKU growth in natural organics, plant-based areas like that. And you will -- and if you think about like paper towels and paper goods and things like that, you would see fewer SKUs, just because the customers move to purchasing bigger-size packages. 
Operator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just wanted to ask how you're thinking about the delta between retail and cost inflation in '22. And then what is the breadth and depth of promotions that you need to hit your long-term top line targets, just given the unique opportunity the industry has had to reset promos over the last 18-plus months here? 
W. McMullen: Gary, you want to... 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Spencer. As we mentioned, we're kind of not really providing sort of an outlook for 2022 at this point around how we think about sales and investments overall. We'll be doing that, for sure, as we get to the March meeting and sharing our Q4 results. 
 I think, really, I would pivot back to some of the comments that we made earlier around we think very much of it from the perspective of in all operating environments, Kroger has been able to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those situations. And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody, using our data, our targeting, our promotional activity and our personalized pricing, and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination. And during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies. 
 So I think from our perspective, we're very much managing the business dynamically to ensure that we can deliver for the customer, but at the same time, deliver on our TSR commitments in the way that we talked about earlier in the conversation. 
W. McMullen: On promotions, we would always use our insights because different types of customers react different types of promotions. So we would aggressively use our insights to personalize promotions. A lot of that is one-on-one with a customer, either sending an old-fashioned mailing or electronically with e-mail or text or whatever. And it really depends on each customer and what do they test react to. 
Spencer Hanus: Got it. That's helpful. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that the Ocado facility is performing better than expected, the one in Florida. But could you just provide some more details on the basket size and the repeat orders relative to your targets? And then how are you thinking about the need, longer term, to build or acquire stores in that market to provide a more complete omni experience down there? 
W. McMullen: Yes. On your second question, I'll answer it first, and you got to walk before you run. So right now, we're totally focused on making sure that the sheds open strongly, and we continue to maintain outstanding NPS scores, or net promoter scores, with our customers. And I am super proud of our team in Florida and Monroe, both in terms of how they continue to connect with the customer and continue to improve. 
 If you look at basket size, the basket size continues to grow. And what we expected and what we believe is as the customers begin to trust the experience, begin to have good experiences, we get a higher share of their total spend. And that's what we're starting to see. 
 And when you look at overall in Florida, one of the reasons why we announced the 2 additional facilities in Florida is obviously the connection and the growth that we are achieving. So far, we feel good about the opportunity in Florida. And as everybody knows, the population growth in Florida and the economic growth in Florida is just mind-boggling relative to an awful lot of the country. So it's an incredible opportunity for all grocery retailers in Florida. Obviously, the offering we have is unique in the market and very proud of what we're getting done there. 
Gary Millerchip: And the repeat usage, Rodney, is higher than we expected, right, than net promoter score. 
W. McMullen: Yes. 
Operator: The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: Rodney, let me start with -- if you would -- how consumer behavior has evolved over the last couple of years. In terms of what percent of purchases, right, are done, shelf price versus promo versus personalized promo. How has that shifted, right? And if you think about personalized promo, is that as much as 50% or something along those lines of what purchases are occurring? And then the work you've done on price perception, how has that trended maybe early days of COVID to where we are today? 
W. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, I want to broaden it a little bit on -- relative to your question. We continue to see people focus on health. If you look at early in COVID, people were not as focused on health, but they're definitely back where they're focused on health in a more aggressive way. All across the board, you see premiumization on what people do. And I always say I'm a reasonably aggressive shopper in our Murray's Cheese. Growing up, I would have never had really good cheese. And once you have a really good cheese, it's hard to go back to what you were used to when you -- before. And what we're finding is customers, when they upgrade and try higher-quality product, they find out they love it, and they become loyal to it. 
 If you look at customers in terms of behavior and buying on promotion, it's been reasonably consistent throughout the pandemic. People stretch their budget where they need to or want to because -- and they will splurge in other places, which is one of the things that -- from a go-to-market standpoint that we really try to help a customer stretch their budget on things that are important to them, so they can splurge on what's important to them as well. 
John Heinbockel: All right. Maybe just a quick one for Gary. You guys now have something on the order of $4 billion to $5 billion, right, of dry powder in terms of your leverage target. How do you think about that conceptually in terms of timing, in terms of return to shareholders versus strategic M&A. What's the philosophy there? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, John. Obviously, we are really proud of the business performance, and it has demonstrated strength in the overall model and the position that we're in, as we said in the prepared comments. I would say our overall capital allocation strategy is unchanged, that we start with where are the opportunities to invest in capital in the business to drive sustainable growth. We're obviously in a great position around maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, and we've been able to make some good progress on chipping away at the pension funding from an overall sort of debt and potential liability there as well. 
 This year, of course, we've been very committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders with the $1 billion, so far, on buybacks and the 17% increase in the dividend that we announced earlier in the year. So I think we've been very consistent with that plan so far. 
 We do think that in the short term, it's important to maintain some flexibility, recognizing some of the uncertainty in the market that we've all talked about, that we're all navigating through at the moment. That being said, within those principles, we do think it's important, and we've been very committed, as you know, as a company, to being very disciplined with cash flow and deploying it to either grow the business or return to shareholders. 
 So as we head towards 2022 and as we move towards the March planning meeting and the business update meeting that Rob shared, we'd certainly expect to share more color of how we're thinking about the excess cash and some of the opportunities we're exploring there. 
W. McMullen: And we would continue to look for things that are the right opportunity for things that add capabilities. So if you think about merging with Home Chef a couple of years ago, it was a capability that we didn't have on the direct-to-customer meal kits, and we've been able to partner with the team there to leverage it back within Kroger as well. 
 So -- and I always think it's important to remind people that we're not required to do any kind of mergers in order to achieve our TSR of 8% to 11% as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Great quarter. Rodney, I think, as you earlier mentioned, that you chose to incur some significant costs in the -- to bolster the supply chain in the quarter. Can you give us some detail on that and whether they last into next year? And then I have a follow-up related to that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the supply chain investments, it was pretty similar to what we did in the second quarter. Now our team has done a nice job of starting to identify some opportunities for efficiency. One of the biggest areas is that we continue to have extra warehouse space, and I guess I hesitate to call it extra warehouse space because we're actually using the warehouse space. But -- and over time, as we feel like things are permanent, you'll see us do more permanent-type warehouse projects to expand capacity rather than using it maybe in a way that's not as efficient. 
 We would expect to continue to do that in the fourth quarter. 
 As we look out next year, we really are working hard to make sure we stay agile in that area because things continue to change so quickly and what's going on with COVID, what's the COVID variance and things like that. So we really are making the decisions on an agile basis, and it's one of the learnings that we've had early on in the pandemic, and we'll continue to do that relative to the supply chain as well. 
Charles Cerankosky: Anything on the labor side worth noting? And then also, when you're talking about the supply chain issues and product outages, is it -- are we talking about branded versus private label, fresh versus shelf-stable, edible versus nonedible products? I mean, where are you seeing the need to spend the most money and use the most management resources to make sure the shareholders that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor, we certainly have partnered with outside companies to supplement our labor resources, especially on the supply chain. If you look at in-stocks, they would be more affected on center store. If you look in the fresh departments, we would be in much better shape in most of the fresh departments in terms of in-stock. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Mark Carden: This is Mark Carden on for Michael today. As a follow-up to some of the earlier inflation questions, where do price gaps stand today? And what's the posture on further investments from here? And have competitors been acting as rationally, given just the heightened inflation this time around? 
W. McMullen: If you look at -- as everybody knows, we go to market as a high/low merchant. So we're aggressive on promotion. We're aggressively using promotion. And we feel very good about where we stand relative to price gaps. And if you look at -- our strategy has always been to neutralize on price and win on our fresh areas and our friendliness and connection our associates have with our customers. And that continues to work well, and we continue to feel good about where we are relative to the various gaps. 
Mark Carden: Great. That's helpful. And then on Ocado, how integrated is the GFC today with your Cincinnati operations? Has it been integrated in click and collect yet? And then in Florida, who do you think you're taking the most share from? 
W. McMullen: If you look at Florida, I think the growth in the market is so strong that I think every -- all boats are rising in Florida. So to say that we're taking share away from somebody, I really don't think of it that way because I just think the market is growing so much. 
 If you look at your first part of your question on Monroe, we continue to further integrate it within the store network. And it's something that, literally, every single week that goes by, we further integrate to really make it a seamless experience for the customer. 
Rob Quast: Thanks for your questions, and that will end our question-and-answer session. 
W. McMullen: As Rob said, thanks for questions. Obviously, thank you for your interest in Kroger. As you know, many of our associates own stock, and we always use the end of this to communicate directly with our associates as well. And as all of us embrace the holiday season, it often becomes a time where we can -- of reflection as we sit down to enjoy special meals with our loved ones. 
 And as I said earlier, I am just so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger Family of Companies and what we, as a team, have accomplished this year. Everyone of our associates is helping make the holidays brighter and fresher for our customers, and more importantly, for that customer and their family. And it doesn't matter if you're making a difference together, like our Kroger Health team, who has administrated 8.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, or as individuals like Donna Greer, a cashier at our store 387 in Collierville, Tennessee, whose unshakable positivity has been an inspiration to many, including the Collierville Herald-Independent who just named her Collierville Woman of the Year. We are so proud of Donna, and congratulations, Donna. 
 When you look at these, they are just a few examples of our incredible people who bring our vision and values to life each and every day. Our associates are beyond amazing and continue to serve our communities and uplift each other and our customers. 
 That concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and encourage you to stay safe. And as always, thank you for your interest in Kroger. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2020-12-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's third quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
 When restrictions were set in place to address the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March, many underestimated the length of time that it would last and the number of families and communities that would be impacted. Many of the stories from the last 9 months have been upsetting, to say the least. Out of this grief, we've also seen the best parts of human nature. From our store teams to our warehouse associates and drivers and our digital teams, plants and offices, our Kroger family of associates have been nothing short of incredible during this period. I am proud of our dedicated associates who have continued to diligently execute our Restock Kroger transformation while serving our customers when they need us most.
 We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do and sales remain elevated, and we continue to grow market share as we enhance our competitive moats, Fresh, Our Brands, Data & Personalization and Seamless. I want to highlight that Kroger's digital sales are incrementally profitable today, partly supported by our rapidly growing digital media business and partially fueled by our constant improvement in operational efficiency. This is true as an incremental pass-through rate of sales, and we have a clear path to continue improving digital profitability. Gary will touch on this more in a few minutes, but I wanted to call this out as well because it demonstrates the strength of not only our Seamless offering, but the overall Kroger ecosystem and how the components parts fit together to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.
 We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made over the last 3 years have positioned us to meet the moment. And as a result of our strong performance and consistent market share gains, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. We are also positioned to deliver beyond 2020 for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of the impacts of COVID-19 will be structural and lasting.
 As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see increased basket sizes and fewer customer visits. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home is now part of the new routine. We are fulfilling our customers' growing demand for premium products as they seek joy and elevated experiences. We're merchandising in new ways to both meet that demand and inspire our customers to trade up to items like premium jumbo blueberries, and by the way, they're delicious, and larger-sized packages of strawberries, raspberries and grapes.
 Home Chef's culinary innovation is inspiring customers with new oven-ready entrées and sides, flat bread, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. In the Fresh soup category, we have introduced new flavorful and delicious Simple Truth and Home Chef varieties. Our efforts are also driving strong market share gain in -- growth in packaged produce, fresh prepared foods and specialty cheese.
 This is also where our brands really shine. Our multi-tiered brand portfolio positions us well to deliver against our customers' diverse needs and desires. Our Brand grew at 8.6% in the third quarter, and we grew market share. Private Selection grew over 17% and Simple Truth grew nearly 15%. These are incredible numbers and demonstrate that while many competitors offer private label products, Kroger's unique approach to Our Brands is a differentiator in a competitive moat. 
 By leveraging our unique data and customer insights, we continue to be at the forefront of product innovation and new product development. During the third quarter, we launched 250 new items, the most ever in a single quarter. New items for the quarter included launches in trending focus areas such as fresh produce, frozen grocery and expansion of our Simple Truth plant-based collection, unveiling more than 50 new fresh and flavorful plant-based foods at affordable prices.
 Moving now to our third competitive moat, Data & Personalization. Many retailers have transactional data, but no one has the customer data and the insights that Kroger has. The quality of our data is a massive advantage because it allows us to develop a significant alternative profit business that generates income from the traffic while benefiting our customers. Our personalization efforts motivate our customers to continue to show interest in Kroger's communications, where nearly 80% have asked to receive relevant information and offers from us. 
 Our customer e-mail open rate is nearly 18% higher than the industry average, which illustrates our ability to offer relevant content and offers to our customers. We continue to advance our personalization technology. About 95% of customer interactions with product on our website and app are enabled by personalization, driving a significantly higher level of engagement in our offers and nearly doubling the likelihood of adding an item to a cart.
 Our store's competitive moat is Seamless. Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As part of our journey, we have been evolving our fulfillment network. First, taking advantage of our existing assets, our physical stores, providing flexibility and proximity to our customers with broad and relevant assortment to meet their needs. Second, expanding our network of assets and capabilities with a portfolio of various-sized facilities optimized based on volume, demand profile and density, leveraging scale and automation to meet the rapidly changing customer needs.
 Our early investments lay the foundation, including over 2,200 pickup locations and over 2,450 delivery locations, which allowed us to capture the increased customer demand for e-commerce offerings during the pandemic we have today, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience around in-store shopping, pickup, delivery and ship-to-home modalities. 
 We are innovating and building out a flexible network of fulfillment options and working with key solutions providers. As we recently announced, we continue to progress on our Ocado facilities program with plans to build customer fulfillment centers in Michigan and in the south region of the country. The upcoming opening of our first 2 fulfillment centers in early 2021 in Monroe, Ohio and Groveland, Florida in collaboration to leverage some of their in-store fulfillment capabilities. 
 We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external industry executives, which together drives our retail supermarket business as well as our other businesses. 
 Kroger has been investing to raise the wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million per year in associate wage increases. As we've noted before, this is $300 million more than the original planned investment. As a result of our continued focus on growing associate wages, Kroger has increased its average wage rate to over $20 per hour with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time off and retirement included. 
 As the largest grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force for good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Since launching our ambitious Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan in 2017, we achieved our goal to donate more than 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our communities by 2020. We also continue to increase Kroger's diversion of waste from landfill, reaching 80% diversion last year on our path to achieve 90% diversion or Zero Waste. This year, Kroger outlined several new long-term environmental commitments and they can be found in our annual environmental, social and governance report. 
 Last month, we were proud to be included among the world's sustainability leaders, recognized by our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth year in a row. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. 
 Since March, we have invested nearly $1.3 billion to both reward our associates and to protect our associates and customers through the implementation of dozens of safety measures like installing protective partitions and physical distancing floor decals. We continue to require masks and limit the number of people in our stores to allow for physical distancing and ensure frequent and proper cleaning procedures are followed. We also promote additional ways to shop using pickup or no-contact delivery. Our total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track below the rate in the surrounding communities where we operate. 
 Our supply chain remains strong and healthy, and we are replenishing our stores daily so that the supplies and products our customers need are readily available. To ensure our customers have access to what they need, we have proactively secured an additional 5,000 truckloads of inventory and increased distribution capacity reserves by 20% within our supply chain to get ahead and avoid potential supply disruptions.
 Furthermore, we have flexed our national footprint by dynamically shifting volume from constrained facilities and regions to facilities and regions with available capacity to accommodate. As America's grocer, we continue to see the unique opportunity to be part of our customers' healthy journey in addition to being their grocer of choice. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained committed to helping people live healthier lives by offering in-clinic and at-home COVID-19 testing solutions, supported by our team of experienced health care professionals. 
 The size and scale of our health care footprint with over 2,200 pharmacies and 220 clinics in 35 states provide us the unique ability to efficiently facilitate COVID-19 testing and immunize a large portion of the U.S. population once vaccines become available. Kroger Health has conducted over 250,000 COVID-19 tests since April and has recently launched rapid antibody tests, which are now available across our family of pharmacies and clinics. 
 We are also partners in the federal -- with the federal government effort to deliver hundreds of millions of potentially life-saving vaccines to our communities. We have also partnered with dozens of state health departments in preparation for the other early administration of vaccines to priority populations. Once an FDA-authorized vaccine is available, we're committed to making it accessible in accordance with the federal rollout plan. All our pharmacies and clinics are staffed with professionals, licensed pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and technicians. 
 Health and wellness is a critical part of our customer value proposition. Pharmacy customers are more loyal, spending 3x more per customer. We have approached pharmacy from an omnichannel perspective for quite some time, allowing customers to choose the most appropriate channel in which to connect with us, whether that be in-store, on the phone or online. For all channels, our strategy is consistent: simplify health care by creating solutions that combine health, wellness and nutrition. I continue to be proud of the work that our associates do to serve each other, our customers and our communities. Stories of their accomplishments and selflessness inspire me every day. The investments we have made to enhance our competitive moats are paying off and as a result, we are growing market share.
 I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team delivered strong results in the third quarter and provided a further proof point of the value creation model we shared at our Investor Day last year. We grew market share and, consistent with our value creation model, were disciplined in balancing significant investments in our customers and our associates with improved productivity and accelerated growth in our alternative profit businesses. The investments we are making in our business are allowing us to deliver strong results today and, importantly, are also setting us up to deliver sustained growth in the future. 
 I'll now provide more color on our third quarter results. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.71 per diluted share, up 51% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.9% during the third quarter and continued to gain market share. Our identical sales growth increase was broad-based and all departments, excluding fuel, achieved positive growth over the prior year. Meat and produce departments led the way, continuing to underscore the importance of Fresh and how we differentiate in quality and assortment for our customers. 
 Digital sales grew 108% in the third quarter and contributed approximately 4.6% to identical sales without fuel. Customer engagement with our digital solutions is driving overall loyalty. When customers engage with both our physical stores and digital channels, they visit more frequently and, on average, spend twice as much as those who shop in store only. The vast majority of our digital customers are shopping in-store as well as online. We are, therefore, confident that the seamless experience we are building across our store and digital ecosystem position us well for continued growth in a post-COVID world.
 At the same time, digital sales growth in the quarter was profitable on an incremental basis, and we continue to improve digital profitability by lowering the cost to fulfill a pickup order and accelerating digital advertising revenue. As Rodney noted, we see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to increase basket size and improve sales mix, further reduce the cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation, and continue to grow digital media revenue.
 We are also excited about the value our merger with Home Chef has brought to our digital capabilities, both in terms of the extended meal solutions offered for our customers and the significant sales growth and profitability improvements the business is achieving. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $871 million, up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased with our ability to consistently pass-through the benefits of elevated sales in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance previously shared.
 Gross margin was 23% of sales in the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. We achieved improvements in gross margin during the quarter through sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage and growth in alternative profit streams. These tailwinds were offset by changes in the sales mix as a result of COVID-19 and continued investments to deliver greater value for our customers, ensuring we sustain long-term customer loyalty and position the business for success in 2021 and beyond. 
 The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 30 basis points. This reflects sales leverage and strong cost control through execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, which more than offset continued COVID-19-related investments to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities and increased incentive costs. We were pleased with progress on our Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives in the quarter and continue to be on track to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.
 As an example, through the implementation of multiple process and technology improvements this year, we have been able to reduce the cost to fulfill a pickup order in-store by double digits compared to the same period last year, while at the same time improving the customer experience by significantly reducing customer wait times. Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Consistent with market trends, our decline in gallons in the third quarter slowed to around 13%. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and our market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.15 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.30 in the same quarter last year. 
 Kroger's alternative profit businesses are built on a platform that leverages our supermarket traffic and data. Our alternative profit businesses had a very strong third quarter, led by tremendous growth in our digital media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, KPM achieved revenue growth of over 190%. Over 1,200 brands are now engaging with KPM as a better way to invest marketing dollars that were previously being spent with advertising platforms and digital media companies. 
 CPG brands continue to leverage our audience intelligence for more effective brand building activations that are achieving better return on ad spend. Thanks to our team's nimbleness and responding to the challenges presented by COVID, our alternative profit businesses are performing well, and we now expect profit growth to exceed $100 million for the fiscal year 2020.
 We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger. We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the multi-employer pension plans in which many of our associates participate.
 We believe charges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time. In July, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security for future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with a pretax investment of nearly $1 billion that will be satisfied by installment payments over the next 3 years. I'm pleased to say that, that agreement is now being ratified by participating union locals and Kroger will incur a charge to net earnings during the fourth quarter of approximately $0.98 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This does not affect adjusted net earnings per diluted share results for 2020, which are provided on a basis that excludes adjustment items such as this contribution. 
 We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Las Vegas and Dallas during the third quarter. Last week, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in West Virginia, and we are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Houston and Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates.
 Turning now to financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our previously communicated capital allocation framework. We are continuing to invest in the business to drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and the growing dividend over time. We now expect total capital expenditures to range between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in 2020. This lower range is primarily due to the expected delay in when spend will occur as a result of COVID-19. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital to ensure that our investments will deliver strong returns, and we continue to see many opportunities to invest in the business to support sustainable long-term revenue and profit growth consistent with our CSR goals. 
 Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.74 compared to 2.5 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strong liquidity reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. This improvement in working capital includes the impact of temporary increase in warehousing and buildup of inventory during the third quarter that Rodney referenced earlier, which we implemented to minimize supply disruptions as a result of higher COVID cases forecast over the winter months.
 During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $304 million of shares under its $1 billion board authorization announced on September 11, 2020. Year-to-date, Kroger has now repurchased $989 million of shares. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.
 Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. As a result of our continued strong sales and market share performance and the expectation of sustained trends in food at home consumption for the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our full year 2020 guidance. 
 For the full year 2020, we now expect total identical sales without fuel to be around 14%. We expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 50% to 53%, and adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19-related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits.
 Looking towards 2021, we believe that our performance will be stronger than we would have expected prior to the pandemic when viewed as a 2-year stacked result for identical sales without fuel growth and as a compounded growth rate over 2020 and 2021 for adjusted earnings per share growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We look forward to providing detailed guidance for 2021 and updating you on our road map to deliver long-term growth in March next year. 
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Gary. We are executing against our strategy even during the pandemic and continue to grow market share. The strong underlying momentum in our core supermarket business and acceleration in the growth of our alternative profit business demonstrates that we are successfully transforming our business model to deliver consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I wanted to ask around e-commerce. It doesn't look like it's getting an explicit call out as a headwind, even though it's sort of doubled in terms of sales. So can I ask you where it's showing up in the P&L? And then a bigger question, presumably sales will normalize a bit in '21, but we think -- or I don't know if you think digital will still be elevated, so how does that manifest itself in the P&L for next year? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. If you look at e-commerce, as Gary and I both mentioned, incrementally, it is profitable this quarter on the incremental growth, and it was driven by the continued improvement in reducing the costs to serve our digital customer and the incremental growth in media. And as both of us mentioned, we would expect to continue to make progress on both of those fronts. 
 As you look to 2021, we expect -- obviously, the digital growth won't be as much as it was in 2020, but we would expect for the customer to continue to expect and want digital service. But the thing that, to me, is inspiring and great to see is customers that are digital shoppers generally still continue to come into the store to use -- to have an in-store experience when they want to. And that customer basically spends double what they spend if they don't.
 So we really like the overall Seamless omnichannel experience that we're delivering and creating for the customer. And we would expect, as we continue going forward, that we'll continue to make progress on the profitability of that digital shopper. And then obviously, once you get past the start-up cost of Ocado and some of the micro fulfillment centers, things like that, that is significantly even lower cost than serving the customer in the store. So when we really look at all the pieces together, we love the progress we're making and we're excited about the continued progress we expect to make. 
 We -- everything we can see, we think the pandemic has accelerated the growth or transition to digital probably by 3 years or so. It wouldn't surprise me if it dropped off a smidgen, but I think it will continue to grow from that because it is a long-term trend where a customer really expects to be able to get something in-store, pickup or delivery, and they expect to be able to bounce back and forth based on what's easy for them. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: Well, I agree completely, Rodney, with your overall comments. Maybe a couple of specifics, I mean, into 2020 and 2021, just to build on some of Rodney's comments. First of all, as you think about 2020, we talked about the pass-through rates, obviously being lower on digital although being incrementally positive. So the way it would show up in our P&L is where typically on the sales growth that we're seeing this year. We might have normally seen a pass-through rate of north of 15% on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. The blended rate between digital and store and having in the COVID cost may be coming in around 10% versus that 15% or higher. So a combination of lower pass-through rate on digital and the incremental COVID cost will be bringing down that overall blended rate. 
 Interestingly, though, on a specific example, as you know, we took away the fee on a promotional basis during the quarter. So that would be a headwind to gross margin. But actually, the value that we're creating through media revenue is really offsetting that. So we've been able to invest in the customer while still being able to replace that revenue by offering personalized digital communications to customers that drive new revenue streams to offset that promotional activity. 
 As you think about 2021, just one sort of -- I guess, an unusual phenomenon just to think through it, but the more improvements we make now on our digital business as we're continuing to improve digital profitability, so as we take cost out of the cost fulfillment order, as we grow the average order value through personalization, as we grow media revenue, that -- those tailwinds will be -- if we achieve them in Q3 this year, we'll get the full benefit on the whole volume next year. So actually on the same level of business, digital would be a tailwind in next year's financial model. Now obviously, as digital continues to grow, it will create some additional investment next year. But on the base level of business that we're generating in 2020 as you create the full benefit from those cost savings from media revenue, it will become a tailwind on that base level business next year in terms of improving profitability of digital. 
Simeon Gutman: Maybe just one follow-up, and I think Rodney mentioned also micro fulfillment will help over time. Just to clarify, the pickup that you're doing for click-and-collect or pick-up orders, all the pickup is being done by in-house employees and I think that's pressure in the SG&A line. The Instacart and the third-party partnerships, where does that show up in the P&L? Do any of your employees actually pick for Instacart? And then, big picture, the economics with some of these third parties, I guess, where is the pricing power? Is there pricing power with you with some of those partners? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Simeon, you'd be correct in the way in which our core pickup business would show up in our P&L as a lower pass-through rate is the labor associated with picking the product in the store. That's what drives the mid-single-digit pass-through rate versus the sort of high-teen rate, if you like, on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. We have a fairly unique model, I think, with Instacart. They are our predominant partner. We do use other partners as well in terms of delivery. So part of that business of Instacart is still delivered through the Kroger ecosystem. So the customer would come on to kroger.com or the Kroger app and would order a grocery delivery. Instacart would pick that product for us, but we're managing it through the Kroger ecosystem. So a significant part of our volume would flow through there. And then, of course, we're compensating Instacart or another third-party for that service. And that would also appear in OG&A. So it would be a similar area of the P&L. 
 The part of the business where Instacart is using their own digital assets and the customers going through the digital ecosystem of Instacart, that would flow through more as a traditional sale and wouldn't have the same level of impact on the P&L. We are a big partner of Instacart. And obviously, we work very closely with them to make sure we're maximizing the efficiency of the model and continue to work on where we can improve the pass-through profitability on all those modalities. 
W. McMullen: And we would look constantly at people to partner with to help accelerate our experiences for our customers. So the example Gary gave is just one of many different partners and some are larger companies, some are smaller companies, but it's really how do we make sure we get -- deliver for the customer the way they want it delivered for them. 
Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I'm not sure how much color you can provide here, but we're trying to assess what benefits you've seen on the gross margin line in recent quarters that might go away in 2021. So as we look towards next year, with the potential for some of the recent grocery boom to reverse, should we be thinking about greater gross margin pressure than a typical year as the benefits from that sales leverage reverses? And is there anything positive or negative you can call out for us next year on the gross margin line as we think about comparisons and 2021 in general? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Erica. We wouldn't, at this point, get into specifics around 2021 detailed guidance as we plan to share more color on our overall outlook for next year at our Investor Day in March and through our Q4 update when we get to that. What I would say is, in general terms, I think it's important to remember that as we talk about the investments that we're making in gross margin today, many of those are in areas that matter most to the customer around personalized promotions and value offers that really resonate with the customer in the areas that we believe will drive loyalty long term, are in the most important categories for the customer around Fresh because that's what primarily drives their decision to shop with a food retailer.
 We continue to invest in advertising to grow our marketing effectiveness and share of voice. So these are the kind of investments that we've been making this year because everything we see in our data and insights says that for -- to ensure that we come out at the end of the COVID environment in a stronger position than we went in and winning market share, we believe those investments that we're making are critical to that, and they're creating increased separation from some of our traditional peers as we come towards that lapsing that time period with COVID. 
 Many of those investments are answered at everyday low prices. So I wouldn't necessarily think of all of them as having to be incremental in 2021 versus 2020, because as we cycle those, we'll obviously be layering on new promotions next year, but they are new, and it's not one on top of the other. It's the new calendar of investments that we make. So I wouldn't necessarily think of the investments that we're making having to be dramatically different. There are certainly going to be some unique factors in the model next year when you start to see deleverage in some of the sales measures that they create some headwinds in the model that you cycle, but with the continued improvements that we're driving in sourcing, the continued improvements that we expect to drive within media revenue, within alternative profits, which went into gross margin, we still feel very good about the balance model that we've shared with you and the investment community around continuing to be able to balance investments with growing customer loyalty and driving overall earnings growth. 
W. McMullen: Gary just briefly mentioned it, and we'll get into more detail in March, but when you look at overall, we do see meaningful opportunities to continue through process change and take costs out both in goods not for resale, cost of goods and operating costs itself. And we'll get into more detail in March. But Gary mentioned, this year, we're on track to take over $1 billion out, and we still see opportunity in 2021 to take additional costs out while not affecting the customers' experience. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I mean given some recently -- some recent industry developments on the online pharmacy side, can you just remind us where Kroger is at right now with its efforts on online pharmacy side? What opportunities do you see going forward here? And also, just curious what you're seeing from the consumer adoption of your existing offerings? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, pharmacy customer typically spends 3x more in our stores. And the pharmacy customer, for us, we've been working hard, our whole teams have, by treating food as medicine. And we're increasingly learning how to help customers eat healthier and live healthier. And for us, it's really the 2 working together is how we help customers stay healthy. 
 If you look at some of the different cards in terms of discount offerings, those are things that we've been offering for several years. We have partnerships with GoodRx as an example and then others. And for us, we think it's part of the overall ecosystem. We really like the fact that we're able to help customers eat healthier and tie-in food. And it appears that about half of health care costs are driven by the way people eat, and we're helping people eat healthier. And it's a partnership that we think will work well. And one of the things that we find is customers still appreciate -- they appreciate online at times, delivery at times, but they also really appreciate having a health care professional that they can talk to one-on-one to answer their questions, and that's what we're able to offer, either in-person or on telehealth. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: There's a decent amount of inflation up the supply chain from you, everything from corn to freight. Your net pricing, I think it's safe to say, it's already risen, thanks to reduced discounting, even if maybe you didn't pull back as much as your peers did. But I'm curious to what extent some of your vendors are asking you now to accept list price increases on their end because of inflation, and what your appetite is to take these increases and pass them on to consumers, especially as we think about the next few months. And I get it, right, you want to be competitive on price, but an argument can be made, you do have a chance to push some prices higher in a low elasticity environment, too. So I'm just curious for your thoughts there. 
W. McMullen: When you look at -- and I'll let Gary get into some of the details. But when you look at overall, a little bit of inflation always [ makes this ] a little easier. And we don't have [ anything ] when we have a little inflation. But as you know, we've built a business model that is strong, whether inflation is high or low or anything in between. If you look at the third quarter, inflation was a little bit lower in the third quarter than the second quarter, and that was primarily driven in the meat commodity, which was consistent with what we expected. 
 You're going to always work with CPGs initially to try to find ways to take costs out of the system so that our customers don't have to have inflation. And it's something that every CPG, that partnership, is a different approach in terms of trying to figure out a way to minimize the impact on customers. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add or some of the specifics on Ken's question? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Ken, I would say that overall, we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned, and you've probably heard us say before, we build our model based on sort of 0.5% to 1% inflation, aligned with Rodney's initial comment. We've been seeing inflation running more in the sort of 2% range, I would say, and slightly up or down, as Rodney mentioned, but generally speaking, in that kind of range. From our perspective, it's obviously hard to predict exactly where inflation goes. We don't see anything in the overall supply chain when you think about food in the system that would cause us to be dramatically different. But there are also risks, obviously, with COVID and what happened in the first quarter around meat, as Rodney also mentioned a moment ago, and there are certainly some produce categories but because of the season have had some supply shortages, too. 
 But nothing that I would say that would take us dramatically today as we look forward outside of that sort of 2%, give or take, range. I think from that perspective, as Rodney said, we always look for ways to mitigate that wherever we can. Where it's justified and makes sense, then, of course, we look at how would that be passed on to the customer. And really, we try and disconnect between inflation and what makes sense to pass on and then our pricing investments, which are more focused on where do we believe customer is looking for the most value and what's going to drive long-term loyalty. So we really try and make sure that if it makes sense to pass to them, we'll do that. But we're always looking to identify ways in which we can really connect more deeply with the customer and build loyalty at the same time. 
Kenneth Goldman: That's helpful. For my quick follow-up. We are hearing some indications and seeing some indications of consumers pantry loading a little bit over the last couple of weeks as COVID has unfortunately worsened. Can you help us with what you're seeing there? And maybe what that means for the quarter-to-date trend so far in terms of your numbers? 
W. McMullen: Ken, you said a word and [ Todd ] is trying to help me understand what you... 
Unknown Executive: Pantry load. 
W. McMullen: Pantry load. The -- we did put in limits on certain categories early in the quarter, and it was really -- the reason we did that was because of learnings from early. And we are -- as we mentioned, we've seen people shop fewer times, but buying more when they shop. The other thing on the holidays, obviously, on Christmas, time will tell, but -- and New Year's, but people obviously celebrated the holidays in a much smaller family gatherings than what they would have in the past year.
 So it's a little of all of the above that's going on. And one of the things that our supply chain team did was go and get access to additional warehouse space and then our procurement was able to buy some of the hard-to-find inventory, so that we will be there for our customers. So I would say, overall, it's pretty limited. It's a little stronger in the West than the Midwest just because of where different parts of the country are with COVID and their approach to COVID. But overall, not as much as what we saw early in the year, but some. 
Gary Millerchip: Ken, the only thing I would add to the second part of your question. So when you look at the cadence of sales, last quarter I would say relatively consistent throughout the quarter, give or take a percent within the -- where we landed at the 10.9%, as Rodney mentioned. We certainly saw some variability by West versus Midwest. The West being more elevated, I think, because of some of the greater restrictions that were in place. As we look at the trend in the current quarter, it will be very similar in -- quarter-to-date in Q4 versus where we ended in Q3. 
 What would be interesting there would be, though, is -- and Rodney alluded to this, was in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, we'd have seen more of that elevated spend in the weaker Thanksgiving, while in any normal environment the week would have been an outstanding week. It wouldn't have been at the same level as sort of a COVID typical week that we've seen. And so the blend of those 3 weeks gets you to looking very similar to where we were in Q3. 
 And I think to Rodney's point, one of the things that the reason that we've left the guidance range out there is, clearly, we're expecting continued tailwind from executing our strategy and seeing COVID trends continuing food-at-home. But understanding how exactly the holidays play out when you've got 2 more holidays, a bit like Thanksgiving with Christmas and New Year still to come, and then Super Bowl actually fall into our fiscal year this year, whereas it did in the fiscal Q4 last year, and that has a fairly significant impact on sales as well. So how our customers spend holiday gatherings and how big their basket sizes are and how that behavior plays out is still something that will be, I think, interesting to see and evolve over the coming weeks and months. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Mark Carden: It's Mark Carden on for Michael today. So you noted that you're continuing to take market share. Assuming this is relative to other retailers, where do you think it's coming from? Is it largely from small traditional players? Mass merchants? Another channel? A little more color here would be helpful. 
W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we never really looked at market share in terms of where it's coming from. And we do everything we can to expand the market and then how are we doing within that market. So we think the market share is pretty broad-based. We're getting it by our existing customers spending more with us. Some of that is driven by our digital offerings in the seamlessness of the digital offer. Some of it's driven because we are getting new customers into our ecosystem, both digitally and in-store. So it's really very broad-based in terms of where it's coming from. 
Mark Carden: Okay. And then as a follow-up, any update on the Walgreens initiative and whether you're looking to accelerate expansion there? 
W. McMullen: I would say we continue to learn. We really aren't yet in a position where we would decide whether to expand or whatever. It continues -- the customers react positively, but we are continuing to learn how to better and deeper connect with the customers. So happy, but still early on. 
Operator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is, can you talk about how you think price investments are driving share shifts in this operating environment today? And are you seeing promotions becoming more important today than they were 3 or 6 months ago? And sort of how you're thinking about that as we head into 2021? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look overall, and I'll let Gary get into more on some of the specifics, we just think it's important. Obviously, there are some customers whose financial situation continues to be very strong and growing, but there's other customers that their financial situation's been more pressed, especially as they've been affected in COVID in different ways, on losing jobs and things like that. We just believe, when you look at long-term, that it's important for customers to understand we did not take advantage of them during COVID. And we continue to invest both in everyday pricing and promotional pricing, and as Gary mentioned, like waiving fees for pickup, things like that, to try to help customers' budget to go further because we just think it's one of those things where the customer is going to appreciate everything that we've done during COVID, when we get out of COVID.
 The other thing, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that I'm so proud of the Kroger team is if you look at -- we've continued to make good progress on our Fresh dimensions, our Friendly dimensions relative to our competitors. And when you look at all of those things together between a seamless experience where a customer can go online, in-store, incredible Fresh experience that's better than they can get with our competition. And with great pricing and incredible promotions, we just really see no reason that customers would shop anywhere else. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only point I would add, and you said it a moment ago, but as we look at the data over a longer period of time, and obviously, none of us have been through something like a pandemic like this before, but we look at periods where customers go through different economic conditions and different environments, whether that be through short-term, natural disasters that we manage or through a longer-term economic cycle. And our learnings over time are that it's really important to stay true to your values, and it's really important to continue to deliver what the customer expects consistently because over the longer term, it really does show through. And we think that's going to be very important to deliver on that expectation that we have to come out of COVID-19 stronger. 
Spencer Hanus: Great. That's really helpful. And then switching to online. Can you just give us an update on the basket size for online orders and how that compares to in-store orders? And would you expect that gap to widen over time? And then just an update on the incrementality, how incremental are online orders today? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the basket size, it's significantly higher. Over time, I've always assumed that it will get smaller as the customer gets more comfortable with shopping multiple channels. But I would say, take 10 of us, what average our average guests together, and that will probably be the closest that -- Gary, do you want to answer the last? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I would say, on incrementality, we're seeing -- and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, but we're seeing very similar consistent patterns in incrementality. It would still be north of 50% in terms of when we look at what customers are buying, when they engage with us digitally. And then we look at it for a longer period of time and look at the categories and the products they were buying from us before engaging in digital, and you combine the total purchasing behavior between store and digital for that customer, we're seeing new categories and new products, and there's a -- on the basket that Rodney mentioned, it was significantly higher. The north of 50% of that basket is incremental when we look at the customers' shopping behavior over a longer period of time. 
Operator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Renato Basanta: This is Renato Basanta on for Karen. So I wanted to follow up on next year, pretty high level, with respect to how you're thinking about the P&L. And appreciating sort of some of the color you've given already. If IDs are down mid-single digits next year, our math implies something like 200 basis points of margin deleverage. I mean you presumably lose some COVID costs and you had some cost savings flowing through. But I'm not totally sure that, that makes up for the deleverage. So just wondering if you could help us think about the P&L in that scenario? Specifically, what sticks in terms of COVID costs next year? And then any color on any other P&L levers you have to pull? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I think overall, we think about -- I wouldn't get into specifics on the sales numbers because we're going to talk about those, as we mentioned, in our Investor Day. But we do believe when we look at customer behavior and how it's changing and some of the structural changes we're seeing and when we look at in previous economic downturns, which we think they'll still be, as Rodney mentioned, some customers that are going to continue to feel the economic impact of COVID for some time to come. That we would expect our 2-year stack sales to be above the traditional level that our model is built on because of how we're connecting with customers, how we're growing market share and some of those external factors. 
 As you think specifically around the puts and takes in the model for next year, the areas where I think it would be important to be thinking about, and we'll be sharing more again in March when we provide that additional color, we would be expecting a significant amount of nonrecurring costs into next year, if you think about things like rewards and incentive plans, paying out based on performance in the business. If you think about some of the onetime costs we would have incurred in the early part of COVID. Even if you look at the run rate costs that we're incurring now versus the earlier part of the year, they would be significantly lower as we've optimized our plans and adjusted and by the back half of the year, I'm sure we're all hoping that a vaccine will be in place that starts to change the environment somewhat as well. 
 So we would absolutely expect certain costs not to flow through into next year. We would expect our profit to continue to be growing. We -- that's not a business area where we expect to see a slowdown in momentum. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth. As you know, we've shared, I think, through Restock Kroger on cost savings, we'll deliver $1 billion this year. We delivered $1 billion in 2019 and 2018. They're all incremental on top of each other, and we wouldn't expect that to be the end of the story on cost savings either. So we would be expecting to share additional plans in next year for how we're going to drive continued cost out of the business. 
 And in the health and wellness space, Rodney mentioned it, but COVID vaccines is certainly an opportunity. But even just more broadly, the pharmacy business, while we've continued to grow our business successfully, it has definitely had some impacts of customers visiting the doctor less frequently and therefore, new scripts being added as would be a headwind versus what potentially becomes a tailwind next year. To your point, we would still expect and contemplate some COVID cost to carry over into next year. We would expect to be continuing to invest in the business, as we always do, to drive loyalty and drive long-term market share gains. We would think fuel will be a headwind likely next year, too, just because of some of the unique circumstances in Q1 this year when you think about the Russia, Saudi Arabia incident that caused prices to get completely in an odd position that drove margins at a level that we're unlikely to repeat.
 So I think there's a lot of moving parts in next year, and that's why we think it's important that we provide you with a much fuller picture in March when we feel like we've got clarity on what the full picture looks like for next year. But overall, we feel very confident in our ability to -- on a 2-year basis, the earnings per share growth on a compounded rate and ID sales growth, though, to be ahead of where we would have expected our TSR model we shared in November last year. 
Renato Basanta: Okay. That's great color. And then just wanted to get your perspective with respect to labor costs. You mentioned you're all-in average wages. But can you give some color on what your actual entry-level wages and how many associates are actually at that level. And presumably, the federal minimum wage could go to $15 an hour. So wondering how you're thinking about managing that possibility for next year? 
W. McMullen: Yes. We have very few of our associates at minimum wage, and about 90% of those are younger than 18 years old or 18 years and younger. So it's people who -- it's their first job. And as you know, we have a ton of people that come to work for us as a job and then make it a career. And we want to make sure that we're providing great career opportunities for people's income can continue to improve. We are -- whatever the federal minimum wage is, we're comfortable with that. We don't take a position on that because as long as our competitors have the same costs as we do, we're very comfortable on operating on an even ground. We -- it's always not good when we have a cost they don't have. So we don't take a position on federal minimum wage, and we view that, that's the politicians' responsibility. 
 As I mentioned, and as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we originally included $500 million for incremental pay increases. And so far, we've actually done $800 million of incremental pay increases for our associates in addition to providing great benefits for paid time off, sick vacation and other things. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney McMullen for any closing remarks. 
W. McMullen: Thank you for your questions today. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. 
 At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, which means that we are called to do more and help make the lives of those around us better. When we see our associates, customers and neighbors affected by systematic racism, discrimination and injustice, we are called to speak out and act in accordance with our values. Over the past several months, we've listened closely to our 0.5 million associates in countless communities across the nation to learn what we can do better to accelerate and promote greater change and equity in our workplace and the communities we serve. 
 We recently shared our framework for action, diversity, equity and inclusion plan. This plan is just the beginning. We are approaching this effort with humility, knowing that we can't do it alone and don't and won't have all the answers. But we are committed. I am committed to continuing to listen, to speak out and to take action.
 That concludes our call for today. Thanks again for your questions, and thanks for your time. Goodbye. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2020-09-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 Please mark October 27 on your calendar for a brief business update from Rodney McMullen and Gary Millerchip on our performance against Restock Kroger goals and how the pandemic is shaping our business model. Given the travel restrictions that are still in place, this meeting will be conducted virtually, and we plan to host a full Investor Day in spring 2021, hopefully in person, to share more on the business outlook and key drivers of our long-term growth model. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you will join us. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Each day, I'm inspired by the work our incredible associates do to bring to life our purpose, to feed the human spirit. I am proud of our dedicated associates who are serving our customers when they need us most. Our top priority is to provide a safe environment for associates and customers, and as the pandemic continues, we know that Kroger will continue to rise to meet the challenge.
 Six months into the pandemic, while there is still much we cannot predict, we still -- we have a greater clarity in many areas across the business. Since March, we have invested more than $1 billion to both reward our associates and to safeguard them and our customers through implementation of dozens of safety measures. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track meaningfully below the rate in surrounding communities where we operate. We have learned and continue to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic.
 We continue to play a key role in addressing the critical need to expand COVID-19 testing. The Kroger Health team facilitated more than 150,000 COVID-19 tests at walk-up and drive-thru locations across the country. Recently, Kroger Health announced the expansion of COVID-19 testing offerings at more than [ 220 clinic ] locations.
 As the nation prepares to enter the flu season, testing will become even more critical to help diagnose COVID-19 amidst potential similar symptoms. We announced earlier this week a comprehensive flu shot program designed to help Americans get their recommended vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Despite the pandemic-related challenges, we delivered extremely strong results in the second quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do, and as a result, we are growing market share. Kroger's strong digital business is a key contributor to this growth as the investments made to expand our digital ecosystem are resonating with customers.
 Our results continue to show that Kroger is a trusted brand, and our customers choose to shop with us because they value the product quality and freshness, convenience and digital offerings that we provide. While we delayed certain cost-saving initiatives in the first quarter, as of the close of the second quarter, we are back on pace to achieve them.
 I continue to be proud of the way our associates have adapted and adopted to the new ways of working during the pandemic to continue to achieve strong results. We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made through Restock Kroger to execute against our competitive moats, fresh, our brand, personalization and seamless, have positioned us to meet the moment. We are also positioned to deliver 2020 and beyond for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of impacts of COVID will be structural and lasting.
 Our data insights show customers are rediscovering their passion for cooking at home and have an aspiration to eat more healthy foods as a result of COVID. When we talk to our customers, they tell us they plan to continue to prepare and eat more meals at home. As children return to school, many families are telling us they plan to make breakfast in the morning and prepare lunch for their children to take school.
 As we talk to other companies across America, we believe return to work will look very different with many employees working part of the week from home. And finally, while the full economic impact of COVID-19 is yet understood, our data shows that during the periods of lower economic activity, we see a structural shift from food consumed away from home to food consumed at home. All of these factors combined lead us to believe there will be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home for the foreseeable future.
 Now I'd like to walk you through some examples of how our competitive moats have positioned us for growth in the short and long term. Even before the pandemic, our digital business had become a tailwind. The pandemic certainly has accelerated customer preference for seamless offerings. Our customers are increasingly turning to our e-commerce solutions for their grocery and household essential needs. Many of our customers are ordering groceries online for the first time as a result of COVID-19, and the majority of them tell us they plan to continue to do so in the future.
 Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,100 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. Kroger was the first to integrate pickup and delivery into one seamless experience. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery has grown significantly during the pandemic.
 Kroger's digital ecosystem continues to expand and customers are increasingly engaging with us. For example, Home Chef is growing incredibly fast, no doubt accelerated by the food at home trend that we believe is a structural change. We also announced that Kroger Ship will expand to offer an extended ship-to-home assortment through a marketplace offering of third-party sellers. We will continue to expand our ecosystem over time.
 The Kroger technology and digital team continues to create innovative experiences that are changing the way we serve customers across America and was recognized for the third consecutive year as the best place to work in IT by Computerworld. This recognition is awarded to companies that have innovative industry-leading workspaces offering a great customer associate experience.
 As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see a slow return to normal from the shutdown period, resulting in fewer customer visits but increased basket size. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home that is now part of their new routine. This makes our leadership position in fresh an even more important sales driver for Kroger. Customers rank our fresh departments higher than all of our big box competitors, and our fresh departments generated strong identical sales in the second quarter and gained market share.
 Our brands is also a key competitive moat for Kroger. We continue to meet the diverse needs of our customers with significant growth across the 3 largest brands. Our customers are eating more at home and we are seeing some customer segments trade up to the larger pack sizes as well as more premium quality foods and natural and organic foods.
 Our larger-sized big pack platform is up well over 50%. Private Selection is up over 17% and Simple Truth is up over 20% in the second quarter. Our brands continues to tap into emerging trends and evolving customer needs, delivering new flavors and innovative new items like the new plant-based Emerge grinds and patties, which launched in late 2019.
 A recent third-party industry study reconfirmed that Simple Truth is the most-loved natural and organic brand in the U.S. Simple Truth significantly outperformed competitors on strength of brand, which is a combination of awareness, willingness to recommend and strength as the driver of store selection. In continuing to exceed our customers' expectations of value and quality while also consistently delivering innovative new items our customers love, our brands remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages.
 Finally, personalization and data remains one of Kroger's key and core competitive moats. We use our data to understand what is most important to our customers and continued to offer promotions throughout the quarter. And we think it is an important component to continue to support as the pandemic continues and government stimulus benefits have expired.
 Many of our customers are experiencing some form of financial hardship that we expect to impact discretionary purchases and eating out. This is one of the unique capabilities of the Kroger ecosystem we can deliver for both customers on a budget and customers who are trading up to premium products and/or larger sizes.
 Turning now to partnerships. While COVID-19 has not necessarily changed how we think about our approach to e-commerce, it has accelerated our thinking about how our full evolution of seamless strategy, inclusive of Ocado. Ocado is a strategic partner of choice, delivering innovation and best-in-class experience and economic advantage through efficient fulfillment. We are confident the future of our ecosystem will incorporate a mix of capabilities and facilities ranging in sizes, and our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and customers or store replenishment.
 Ocado's model incorporates state-of-the-art automation and AI to expand Kroger's products to a larger footprint. And our model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. We are on track to open the first 2 sites in the spring of 2021.
 Developed talent is a driver of Restock Kroger, and we work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external executives, both food industry and technology, which together drives our retail supermarket business and all of our businesses.
 Kroger has been investing to raise wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million in associate wage increases, and that is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time-off and retirement plans, our average hourly rate is over $20.
 As the largest traditional grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force of good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2020 ESG report, highlighting progress toward our sustainability goals. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and company.
 We recently made the decision to contribute an additional $20 million split evenly between The Kroger Co. Foundation and the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. We also added $5 million to a fund created to support the advancement of racial equity and justice. We believe that it is vitally important to get resources to our communities as they continue to face hardships related to the pandemic, the economic downturn and racial injustice.
 Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant investments to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, strengthen our brands and our personalization capabilities and to enhance product freshness and quality. These investments, combined with how our associates have responded to the pandemic and customers eating more meals at home, give us confidence that Kroger's performance in both 2020 and 2021 will be even stronger than previously anticipated.
 I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into our business results, I wanted to echo Rodney's comments from earlier and say how extremely proud I am of our associates for continuing to serve our customers and communities throughout the pandemic. We remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways that are most relevant today and that build future loyalty.
 Results for the second quarter were strong and reinforce the strategic investments we have made over the last several years as part of Restock Kroger. The quarter turned out much better than we previously expected. This was due to several factors, including stronger sales results and disciplined balance between cost savings and investments while also managing cost inflation volatility in key fresh categories. Additionally, fuel performed better than predicted, and we were very pleased with our alternative profit results, which rebounded from COVID-19 impacts more quickly than anticipated.
 Now I'd like to provide further detail on second quarter performance. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.73 per diluted share, up 66% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 14.6% during the second quarter. Sales momentum continued from the first quarter with identical sales without fuel in June and July trending in the mid-teens. During our final period of the quarter, which runs from mid-July to mid-August, identical sales without fuel were 12.5% as we saw reduced government stimulus and SNAP funding and lower back-to-school activity.
 Digital sales grew 127% and contributing 4.4% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement and with our pickup and delivery services continued to grow and we continue to invest in the customer experience. This included offering fee-free pickup to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time.
 Our digital sales growth was profitable on an incremental basis, and we were pleased with the progress we made to improve profitability by reducing the cost to fulfill a pickup order during the quarter. We see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to improve sales mix, continuing to reduce cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation and accelerating growth in media revenue generated from digital sales.
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $894 million, up 43% compared to the second quarter of 2019. We were pleased with the overall pass-through rate achieved from the elevated sales in the quarter, which, including the impact of digital growth and incremental costs associated with COVID-19, was approximately 10%. COVID-related cost investments in associate depreciation, cleaning, safety and supply chain totaled approximately $250 million in the quarter.
 Gross margin was 22.8% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 5 basis points, primarily driven by sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage related to shrink, transportation and advertising costs plus growth in alternative profit streams. This was partially offset by price investments as we continued to invest in delivering greater value for customers and mix changes from lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli bakery.
 The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 61 basis points due to sales leverage and execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, partially offset by ongoing COVID-19 related costs mentioned earlier to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 27 basis points due to sales leverage. We were very pleased with the progress on our Restock Kroger savings initiatives in the quarter and now expect to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.
 Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Compared to the first quarter and consistent with market trends, the decline in gallons slowed to around 15% in the second quarter. We remain well positioned with our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program.
 The average retail price of fuel was $2.14 this quarter versus $2.71 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year. While fuel operating profit was $30 million lower than the same quarter last year, this was better than expected. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability will continue to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019 and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID.
 Kroger's alternative profit model is built on a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data, with media and Kroger Personal Finance representing the largest contributors to growth in 2020. Thanks to our team's responsiveness to the challenges COVID has presented to our alternative profits portfolio, these businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and we now expect growth approaching $100 million for the fiscal year 2020. We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future, and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger.
 Kroger precision marketing drove tremendous acceleration in our media business in the second quarter. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, revenue growth doubled compared to the first quarter. In-store media also bounced back as stay-at-home orders were lifted in many of the communities we serve.
 Kroger Personal Finance experienced higher transactions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as customer activity improved in gift cards, lottery and money services. While trends at KPF are improving, we continue to expect KPF profit will be lower than our original expectations for 2020 due to COVID-19.
 We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the pension plans in which our associates participate. We believe challenges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time.
 Consistent with this effort, last month, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security of future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with an investment of nearly $1 billion. Ratification of this agreement is still expected to occur in the third quarter of 2020.
 We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in [ Roadie ] during the second quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Little Rock, Houston, Dallas and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking ahead, towards the end of this year, we will be negotiating with the UFCW for Fry's stores associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us to create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to financial strategy. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We will provide more color on our future approach to capital allocation and the use of excess cash during our March 2021 Investor Day.
 In 2020, we are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments will deliver strong returns and position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We now expect total capital expenditure to range between $3 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. We have widened the range of our guidance due to the uncertainty on timing of when spend will occur because of COVID-19.
 Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.7 compared to 2.46 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance, significant improvements in working capital and delayed tax payments as a result of the CARES Act. We expect working capital to improve for the year although not to the level experienced year-to-date, which is inflated by sales growth due to COVID-19.
 During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $211 million of shares under its $1 billion Board authorization announced on November 5, 2019. On September 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, replacing the prior authorization. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.
 Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared last quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continued to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. While there are clearly still many unknowns, as Rodney shared in his opening comments, we now have greater clarity in many areas of our business and the drivers of food at home consumption.
 As a result of our strong performance in the first half of the year, the expectation of sustained trends in food-at-home consumption and confidence in our ability to execute against the Restock Kroger strategy, we are updating our full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect total identical sales without fuel to exceed 13%, and we expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 45% to 50%. We are providing a wider range on guidance than we would normally provide at this point in the year to account for the variety of outcomes that could materialize as a result of the pandemic.
 In the second half of 2020, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the level we've experienced so far this year. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19 related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits. We expect fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2020.
 Finally, relative to delivering on our total shareholder return growth targets, as shared at our November 2019 Investor Day, these factors also lead us to believe that our 2021 business results will be higher than we would have expected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the operating environment continues to evolve, we will be transparent and communicate any important changes that could impact our outlook.
 I'll now turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We provided specific guidance to help you understand how we see the business today. While there are still a lot of uncertainties, we are confident in our team's ability to navigate through this. We are laser-focused on winning with the customer, and our true measure of success internally will be growing market share sustainably over time.
 As Rebekah said earlier, we have scheduled a call on October 27. We will provide a business update relative to our November 2019 business commitments as well as our overall ESG commitments. We value the impact of an in-person meeting with you and have made the decision to reschedule the timing of our traditional Investor Day to spring of 2021.
 We remain incredibly confident in both our business model and TSR model and believe that not only 2020 will be strong, but as Gary mentioned, 2021 will be even stronger than we previously anticipated. Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: This is actually Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is just, can you talk about the comp trends that you guys are seeing quarter-to-date? And then we've seen ticket growth outpacing traffic growth as consumers combined trips. When do you think ticket and traffic trends get more normalized? 
W. McMullen: The -- in terms of where we are quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of double digits. And if you look at -- when traffic returns to normal, it's kind of fascinating. As you look at markets where COVID incident rates are lower or less severe, what we find are people start visiting the store more often but they don't spend as much. But if you look at overall, the trends are pretty similar.
 That's probably really the only insight that we have at this point. We do find everything that we can tell, people are enjoying cooking at home, enjoying eating as a family. And those are things that we believe will last past COVID. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: No. I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think we are seeing some gradual sort of, I guess, this return to patterns that customers get comfortable with in a COVID environment as -- continue to see large basket sizes and fewer trips, but we've been encouraged certainly in the second quarter by, well, categories like deli, bakery would be significantly lower than the heightened levels of sales we'd have seen in the last quarter or so from categories like grocery and meat and produce.
 Deli, bakery is positive again, which I think shows that customers are starting to at least return to some of those behaviors and certainly in areas like specialty cheese and floral. It's really encouraging to see those categories turning to sort of low to mid-single-digit ID sales as well. 
Spencer Hanus: That's really helpful. And then in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that digital sales were profitable on an incremental basis. Can you provide some more color on that comment? And then how do you expect the launch of a marketplace with Kroger Ship to impact the profitability of the online business? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. So the way we think about digital profitability is -- I know we've shared some of this color before, but essentially, we track very closely how a power customer behaves and when they engage digitally, and we see a significant level of incremental sales overall in the customer relationship. Obviously, you have to offset that against the incremental costs that we incur in filling the order for the customer.
 And in addition to that, then, of course, we're now seeing tremendous growth in digital media revenue that's generated off of a customer spending dollars with us digitally because we can then truly personalize the communication to the customer, and we can close the loop for a CPG partner in understanding whether that advertising led to a sale with the customer themselves.
 So when we look at the overall impact of the incremental sales, the cost to fill the order and the media revenue, we see a profitability pass-through, if you like, in terms of the transaction from a digital perspective. It's obviously at a much lower level than you would see in the store channel, but we are seeing that profitability flow through on an incremental basis.
 We believe that there's significant opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to continue to improve that profitability. The first would be improving sales mix, and we believe there's a lot of opportunity using our personalization tools to do that. Marketplace would be a good example that -- well, also opportunity to do that as well. So that would be a part of that component where we think continuing to improve the basket size and the type of products the customer has in the basket is definitely going to be a driver of bridging any gap between store and digital profitability.
 Beyond that, we also believe there's significant opportunity to improve profitability by continuing to reduce the cost to fill an order through automation and process improvement and continuing to grow those digital media dollars. In the short term, we have plans on those areas today. And then, of course, as Rodney shared on the call earlier, Ocado would also be a significant accelerator of those drivers by further improving the customer experience to improve mix and continuing to take more cost out of the model through automation and AI. 
W. McMullen: Just to add a little bit, and everybody's heard me say this before, but when you look at digital overall, we've always viewed our first job is to make sure we don't lose the customer. And obviously, with our teams, they've done a fantastic job of supporting amazing growth, and that's our technology team, our digital team, our store teams and warehouse.
 We can now see a clear path to profitability of that. And one of the insights that Gary just shared in terms of the incremental is one piece of that path to profitability. Obviously, all the things that we're working on together, what we're expecting of ourselves is we will get to the point where we're indifferent if a customer connects with us digitally or a physical store. And everything that we can see, the customer actually will do both. And we made great progress on reducing cost to serve on a per customer basis. And then if you look at some of the other pieces of our digital offering like Home Chef, Home Chef had an incredible quarter, both sales growth and profitability as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: So Rodney, you mentioned you took share in fresh. How do you think your share in other categories trended? And can you give us more detail behind your decision to reengage in price investments during the period? I think that was something that -- or at least promotions were put on hold in the prior period. It sounds like the overall environment has gotten a bit more competitive in the most recent period. Is that fair? 
W. McMullen: No. I would say a little differently. We've promoted throughout the pandemic. Now we did change what we promoted because obviously, you want to promote what you have, so we would have not promoted paper towels and toilet paper and certain meat items and things like that because just the availability of supply. But we've had promotions throughout the pandemic and it's really on the things that matter.
 We continue to invest in price, and we think it's really important that we think customers will look at it reflectively that we've been there to support them throughout to help them stretch their budgets. So the -- as Gary mentioned, waiving the pickup fee, continuing to invest in promotions, continuing to invest in price, all of those are things that we believe will pay off. Our customers will reward us for what we're doing over time. On market share, I specifically talked about fresh, but we continue to gain share in the center store, fresh and all areas of the store, and our own brands continue to gain share as well. 
Michael Lasser: Okay. And so you mentioned the final period of the quarter was -- IDs were up about 12%. It sounds like it slowed a little bit in the most recent period. Would you attribute that to some of the change in unemployment benefits in staff and continued pressure from back to school? And how does that back-to-school pressure manifest? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the back to school, there's a lot of moving parts and we think that's part of it. We also think if you look at the holidays, people celebrate holidays differently. If you look at some of the sporting events, people are celebrating those differently. So there's a lot of moving parts, so I think it's hard to say the specifics. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think it's an interesting time right now, to Rodney's point, because we look at the trend in markets where we try and correlate results to higher levels of COVID cases, and it's become a lot more difficult to really track those trends. There's certainly a small level of correlation, it seems like, between the higher markets with COVID cases and the differentiation where you've got states and markets that have smaller levels of cases. But that being said, it seems like, to Rodney's point, I think more of the trends are being as customers are now adapting to some level of a new normal. And so as you mentioned, Michael, things like back to school certainly impacts for a period of time. I think the government's [ now followed ] in the market. We would say we saw a change there in the final period of the prior quarter and a little bit in this quarter.
 But then it's like what's the next trigger. So as now we're coming through the back-to-school campaign, what will happen in the final part of the year as maybe customers are less willing to eat out at restaurants in the cold and if capacity is still constrained in restaurants. I share that just because I think there's going to be almost different triggers that it's less, in some ways, what we're seeing in the trends around what's happening with COVID cases, but more about how our customers are adapting to what's the new theme and the new event that causes them to change shopping behavior. I think there's multiple different factors that are going on with the customer. And I think that the combination of all those of what led to, I think, the slightly different trajectory compared to the first 2 parts of quarter 2. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Two for me. First, I wanted to see if you've seen any notable changes in your product sales mix since the stimulus checks have run out. At least in the scanner data that we can see, store brands are still losing a lot of share within the measured grocery channel. But I'm not sure if that sort of corresponds with exactly what you're seeing. I might have expected store brands to do a little bit better right now overall. But I'm just curious if maybe you're seeing anything that's changing in there more recently. 
W. McMullen: Ken, I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's massive type trends. If you look at during the quarter, we would have seen better sales growth in CPG brands than own brands. But if you look at own brands overall, they continue to gain share relative to the market. The -- you continue to see behavior changes based on what's going on in people's lives, but you still see people aggressively -- alcohol sales are very strong, beer and wine is very strong. If you look at big pack, sales are strong. If you look at premium products, sales are strong. So you continue to see people trading up in places where they want to. If you look at, as Gary mentioned, deli, bakery, continue to make progress. So it's -- I love the question, but I think it's still hard to give a specific answer. 
Kenneth Goldman: No, I understand. And then my follow-up, your FIFO gross margin ex fuel in the first quarter was up, I think, 46 basis points year-on-year. It was up still this quarter, but to your point, it was up less, I think, 5 was the number. Gary, I think you were very clear highlighting price investments as one of the reasons for that deceleration.
 I just would love to get a sense of what you're looking at for that number going ahead, whether we should be sort of thinking about in our models something closer to the first quarter or something closer to the second in terms of year-on-year. And I know there's all sorts of puts and takes and that's a very difficult one to answer. I'm just trying to sort of poke around a bit and see what you might think about that. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Ken. I think as we've shared kind of consistently, our goal is really to be balanced in the business model and continue to balance the investments we'll be making in supporting the customer, which is certainly our continued intent with the savings that we achieved through sourcing benefits and then, of course, alternative profit being accelerator of gross margin as well.
 In the quarter itself, where a lot of the focus for us was, as Rodney mentioned, the fee-free pickup is an important part of value for the customer. And we believe our digital sales relative to the more traditional grocery sector is pretty high. And so that's a bigger influence in our numbers, and we believe we gained market share in digital as well during the quarter. So that, I think, influences the level of investment, for one thing.
 I think the second part is fresh department's inflation was pretty volatile during the quarter, and we saw certainly a [ mean time ] inflation and in meat, produce and deli, bakery, cost inflation would have been higher than retail as we were investing in supporting the customer through the volatility in price and making sure we were building long-term loyalty.
 So I think we continue to be expecting to invest where it makes sense for the customer, but we feel very confident in our ability to balance those investments with cost savings through Restock Kroger, sourcing benefits and continuing to see leverage in things like shrink, warehouse and transportation and advertising. So I think the key message from us would be balanced and very consistent with the long-term growth model that we shared. 
Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I want to start off, I guess, with just your capacity on click-and-collect. I was just curious where you guys are today from meeting all the demand out there for click-and-collect. And then related to that, I was also curious whether you think the removal of the pickup -- or the temporary removal of pickup for you is contributing to some of the share gains you're seeing? 
W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of capacity, we're constantly adjusting the capacity during the day because as people get used to the new normal, the times they want pickup slots constantly change. It's one area where I've been super proud of our teams, both stores and our data and technology and operations team in that constant adjusting and incrementally hiring people. There are stores now where we're aggressively investing a little bit of capital to be able to expand what's available within that store, and when we do that, that will allow us to add slots as well. So I would say the constraints on slots would be a slight opportunity, but I think the teams have done a great job of continuing to expand.
 The removal of the fee for a pickup, the temporary removal, is we look at it more in terms of trying to help a customer stretch their budget and try to be helpful in this environment. Customers still tell us the reason they like our pickup experience is really the freshness of our products and the quality of that and the assortment that we offer. So it probably helps, but I think it's more driven by the experience in the fresh side than waiving the fee. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then I guess one quick follow-up for Gary. What's the right way to think about COVID expenses in the back half of the year? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but obviously, we did give you some color on the expense that we saw in Q2. Certainly, we would expect to be able to continue to optimize our operating plan, so we'd expect to provide continued efficiency in some of those plans that we execute on, and certainly, that was the case if you think about our investment in Q1 to Q2 as we're transitioning through the year and learning more and able to optimize our approach.
 That being said, one of the reasons that cost would have been probably a little bit higher than we originally thought in Q2 was that during the quarter, if you recall, many states, if not all the states we now operate in, are mandating masks, and we decided to adopt that proactively before it happened in many states to really reinforce the importance of safety in our stores and providing the inventory for masks to make sure that during that transition, all of our customers were able to have access to a mask as a new cost, if you like, that we incurred.
 So we're being very dynamic in the way we're managing those costs to make sure that we're, first and foremost, maintaining safety, and then secondly, obviously, being as efficient as we can be. But we feel very confident in our ability to manage and balance those costs with the incremental cost savings that we're achieving in our original model.
 And as I shared in the prepared comments, we've been -- the team has done a phenomenal job in really adapting and adjusting our cost saving plans in light of COVID. And whereas in Q1, we announced that we may have some headwinds on the original $1 billion. We feel confident now we can achieve those. So overall, there'll certainly be those ongoing investments, but we feel confident in our ability to be able to manage them. 
Operator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Karen Short: Just actually on the gross margin, I had one quick follow-up and then I had a bigger question. Can you just give a little color on selling gross margins? I know that's not a topic that we've -- you've talked about on a consistent basis, but I think it would just help from the context of -- you said it drives customer loyalty to continue to promote during this time period and a lot of your competitors are not promoting. So I was wondering if you could give a little color on selling gross margins this quarter versus the first quarter. 
Gary Millerchip: Well, certainly, Karen, thanks for the question. It would have been an investment. As you are aware from what we shared in the first quarter, we saw significant benefit in expensing gross sales leverage across warehouse and transportation, across shrink and also across advertising. And while sales obviously tapered in Q2 versus Q1, we would continue to have seen selling -- expecting growth, I'm sorry, leverage on our overall sales results. So to be at 5 percent -- basis point improvement overall on gross margin, that would reflect the fact we invested in our selling growth rate during the quarter.
 In the areas that I mentioned around continued acceleration of digital pickup, particularly in the fresh categories to make sure we're delivering value for our customers. And then there would also be, I think, an element that's important to mention, mix and the fact that with deli, bakery being a lower factor in the overall sales growth would also have brought down the selling growth rate somewhat as well. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then I wanted to just shift gears to digital for a second. So it looks -- I mean you can kind of back into e-com being around the 7%-ish of sales range now. So first, is that accurate? And then I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of a split or a split between what pickup is and versus delivery within that. And then I was wondering if you could give a little more color in terms of basket on each of the different like in-store versus pickup versus delivery. And then last portion of that is just any color on the new customers that you're gaining with respect to digital. 
W. McMullen: If you look at -- our percent of sales would be a little bit higher than your estimate. If you look at mix between pickup and delivery, it's still predominantly pickup. And we find customers find pickup incredibly flexible on their schedule, much more so than delivery, and that's the reason why they continue to like pickup in a good way. If you look at basket size, basket size would be significantly bigger on pickup versus in-store and pickup and delivery would be pretty similar.
 On new customers, we're finding -- we're getting a lot of new customers, both in-store and digital both and probably the biggest change for both of those groups. We -- in the past, a new customer would have to earn their right to start getting loyal customer mailings and digital offers and things like that. During this, we've started treating customers as loyal shoppers immediately rather than waiting for them to engage with us for a period of time. And what we're finding is we're having success on retaining those customers and repeat purchases as well. 
Gary Millerchip: Maybe I can help you with that, Karen, on the comment about pickup and delivery. As Rodney mentioned, pickup is a significantly larger portion of the overall volume. I would say both of them are growing triple digits, so we are seeing very strong growth in both, but there isn't like a major change in the mix, if you like. Both have continued to grow significantly in the COVID period. 
Operator: Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. 
Robert Ohmes: Rodney, I was hoping, as a follow-up to Karen's question, can you give us more color kind of on what you're doing with Ocado versus the original plan? And maybe a little more color on kind of signposts we should be looking for in the back half and into next year on Ocado? And then just a separate question. Can you guys just give us color on what happened Labor Day weekend for you guys and how that was or was not similar to last year, et cetera? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll answer Ocado, and Gary, I'll let you talk about the Labor Day weekend. When we have our investor meeting in March, we'll get into a lot more details on Ocado. If you look at, obviously, the first initial part of the 2 first sheds that we'll open in Monroe, Ohio and in Florida, we'll be just scaling it and the assortment that customers have a desire for in that offering versus some other offerings. Those are 2 key parts.
 We will get into specific signposts in terms of how to hold us accountable. We're using the learnings from Ocado in terms of what they have in the U.K., obviously in Canada and France. And it will be taking all of those learnings and then making sure we manage the cost of the start-up as well. So we're excited. We can't wait and we wish they would have opened a year ago. 
Gary Millerchip: And then Robby, on your second question, I would say, probably the broader comment I would make is Rodney shared, we're still trending in double-digit sales in the early part of the current quarter. It's a pretty difficult period to read, actually. It's probably the most important point, I would say, because the Labor Day weekend changed by a week, but we're also cycling weather from last year and then having some weather in this year. So it's been a really interesting, I would say, ride for the first 4 weeks of the new quarter and trying to interpret what's going on.
 If we look at the cycling and adjusting for the weeks, I wouldn't say we really saw anything materially unusual out of Labor Day, except for some of the weather events in certain markets adding some complexity to the data. But overall, as we're coming out the other side of that, as Rodney mentioned, trending in the low double digit early part of the quarter. 
Robert Ohmes: That's helpful. And then one quick just follow-up on digital in those markets where people are coming back into stores. Is it -- do you see a significant falloff in digital? And would it be coming more from delivery or more from pickup? 
W. McMullen: The mix between pickup and delivery is more driven by available slots. We do not -- the growth, it's still triple-digit growth but it would be a little bit slower growth, but it's still meaningful growth. 
Operator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Good quarter, by the way. I feel for you guys on the gross margin, by the way, and I wanted to follow up on this because I think there's been some criticism in the market that your gross margin was not up as much as the sell side was modeling. But you're probably doing what you should with this windfall, right? You're investing in price, still delivered a large EPS beat. Others are not investing.
 So I'm kind of curious, what are you seeing from a price gap standpoint in the marketplace currently, both versus like bigger discount players like Walmart but also your conventional players who maybe seem to be taking advantage of the current environment. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think you summarized it well. From our perspective, we believe it's very important that we continue to deliver value for customers and we're staying very true to that plan. And when we look at prices, as we've shared a couple of examples on the call, for us, it's not just about everyday low price but it's about the promotional plan, it's about the investment in digital. And we feel like we're on a very clear path to deliver value for the customer that will drive long-term loyalty.
 The way that our customers, when we talk to them and how we look at our data and measure value, we feel very good about the position that we're in, and our customers tell us we're delivering strong value to them. And we believe really kind of linked a little bit, I think to Rodney's comment, about how we think about setting up 2021 and making sure that we're winning long-term market share and growing our business so that the -- as things cycle through the pandemic, we end in a stronger position than we would have done prior to COVID-19 is really the journey that we believe we're on to make sure that we continue to connect more deeper with customers and drive value. We feel good about the journey and the results that we're achieving. We feel it's setting us up for the ability to be able to sustain that long-term growth in the future and as [ Rodney mentioned ]. 
Edward Kelly: Can I just follow up, Gary, by the way? When you look at the gross margin, we have heard from one of your peers that the end of May, June period was tougher because there was inflation in some of your categories, particularly protein. Was there anything about the cadence of the gross margin this quarter that was notable? Was it softer earlier on? 
Gary Millerchip: It certainly -- there's been a lot of dynamic changes in some of those fresh categories as I mentioned earlier ahead that we have to manage through. And I think the team did a phenomenal job in doing that and making sure that we help our customers navigate through that. So certainly, the -- we would just experience some of those same elements to manage during the early part of the quarter, which would have impacted at that point. But I think your initial question is the more important one of how we are thinking about balancing and investing in the business to make sure that we're delivering long-term growth. I wouldn't say that it affects how we think about how we're managing the business for the future. 
W. McMullen: To me, overall, Gary's last point is the critical one. We really are looking at everything in terms of what will connect us with the customer and position us best for sustainable growth over time and continue to gain market share. And we're -- and that's what we're doing. Obviously, we were able to continue to manage expenses very well as well, which gave us the capacity to invest as well. 
Rebekah Manis: And we have time for one last question. 
Operator: And that question will come from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Was curious if we could talk a little bit about just price inflation mix and tonnage. I know there's been a lot of comments about traffic and basket. But I think the way that you guys tend to look at it is more tonnage. And so just curious if you can help us understand how that's played out in the quarter and what you're thinking about into the back half as you think about that kind of high single-digit ID outlook there between price inflation and tonnage. 
W. McMullen: We -- tonnage would continue to be strong. We have -- we're still continuing to -- if you look at our supply chain, our team has done a nice job of identifying other sources of capacity. And we are -- have access to warehouses both that we manage on a temporary basis and others that continue to support and manage the tonnage.
 For me, the thing I find exciting about the tonnage is it's across the whole store. So tonnage growth is strong in center store, it's strong in produce, it's strong in meat, in all areas. So -- and obviously, in terms of the guidance that Gary gave for the rest of the year, we would expect that to continue.
 We continue to expect cost inflation will be a little bit more than retail inflation. And those are categories where it's more driven by short-term things. If you look at meat, we would expect meat inflation to be more normalized, and as it more normalizes, then you would see our balance between the 2 very close. 
Gary Millerchip: Just maybe add to Rodney's comments on tonnage, it ties a little bit back to Rodney's comments on market share as well that we're certainly focused on, as Rodney mentioned, our most important measure of success on sales growth is obviously growing market share. And we look at that very closely through tonnage and units as much as we do through dollars because of the -- again, making sure that we're investing in the customer, and we're certainly pleased with our tonnage market share growth as well as the dollar market share growth during the quarter.
 And then, as Rodney mentioned, Kelly, we've -- I think you've heard us say this before, but we generally build our model off of the 0.5% to 1% inflation. We'd certainly be running a bit ahead of that when you think about cost inflation, as Rodney mentioned earlier, with meat in particular being high but grocery would be probably a little bit north of 2% as well right now based on some of the trends that we're seeing. 
Kelly Bania: Okay, that's very helpful. And then if I can just ask 2 quick follow-up ones related to digital. I think I heard you mention regarding the pickup fee that, that was a temporary removal. And I guess I was just curious under what circumstances or time frame would you consider bringing that back? Or is that a market-by-market specific thought process?
 And also, maybe just thoughts on membership. Obviously, a lot of competitive developments with membership and in terms of digital, whether pickup or delivery. So just curious if you're in any way thinking of evolving into something like a membership program over time. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On the digital fee, it really -- at the moment, we put it in place just trying to help our customers and especially customers on a budget to help them stretch their weekly spending. And what we would do over time, we -- at this point, we really haven't decided, but it's part of the overall value equation that we're providing to customers.
 On membership, as you know, we continually and have been, for a while, testing various types of membership programs. And when we find a membership program that really works, you'll see us continuing to be more aggressive with it. As everybody on the call knows, we've had a membership program in terms of fuel rewards for years. Now customers don't have to pay for that, and they get the rewards incrementally for free, obviously, and that's something that's been very successful and very successful on sharing value with customers and creating additional customer loyalty, which is something that we've done for several years.
 So thanks, Kelly, for your questions, and thanks to everyone for your questions. Before we close today, I'd like to start with just a moment of silence and remembrance of the lives lost during the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001.
 Thank you. As you know, I usually take time before we end our call to share a few final comments directed toward our associates. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge and change our country, not the least of which is the loss of lives in America and around the world. I appreciate our associates for doing their part to keep our customers and each other safe, especially for leading by example by consistently wearing masks.
 We are incredibly confident in terms of the future and the things that we do to take care of our associates and customers. And together, we will get through COVID-19. Thank you for your time today, and have a great weekend. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-06-18 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm joined by Rodney McMullen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer, and they will be providing an update on the business and discussing first quarter results. 
 This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. 
 But before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, so Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. 
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. A lot has happened in our world since the last earnings call. We've had to adapt quickly to a new way of life. The COVID-19 pandemic and the most recent instances of racial injustice have changed our country in unmistakable ways, most profoundly the devastating loss of life and livelihood that has affected so many Americans. During the crisis, Kroger has been guided by our purpose and our values. I am proud of our associates who stepped up when we were called to be there for our customers, communities and each other. We are proud of the heroic and dedicated associates who are on the frontline, serving our customers when they need us most. As America enters the next phase of the pandemic, we know that our associates will continue to rise to the challenge, delivering Fresh for Everyone and helping our customers, communities and America emerge even stronger. 
 I am proud of the measures that we've taken across our business to safeguard and support associates, customers and our communities. During the pandemic, our priority has been to provide a safe environment for our associates and customers with open stores, e-commerce solutions and an efficiently operating supply chain so that our communities have access to fresh, affordable food and essentials. 
 Since March, the company has invested more than $830 million to do just that. This includes the $150 million Thank You Pay for our frontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy and call center associates, which are providing -- which we are providing to acknowledge their hard work and dedication to maintaining safe, clean and stock stores. We are pleased that our associates will share in the company's success with today's second installment of Thank You Pay. We continue to invest in, support and protect our associates. We are providing emergency leave to associates. We are offering free COVID-19 testing to our associates. We have increased the contribution to our Helping Hands Fund to $15 million to provide additional financial support to associates experiencing hardship due to the virus. Our work to safeguard associates will continue as long as the pandemic threat exists, and we are proud that Kroger was named in Forbes Magazine as leading 1 of the top 10 employer responses to the pandemic. 
 As part of Kroger's commitment to help America reopen safely, our Kroger Health team stepped up to help expand access to testing as a partner in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public-Private Testing Partnership. Through this initiative, we have tested more than 82,000 patients in 15 states. We also offered free check cashing for stimulus, unemployment and social security checks. Since launching this service, we've cashed more than 229,000 checks, totaling $244 million. Kroger has learned and continues to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate is tracking meaningfully below the markets where we operate, and our overall accident rate is the lowest we've ever recorded. I'm incredibly proud of how our associates have worked together to practice creating a safer environment for our customers, communities and each other. 
 We've been able to share our loans with other businesses and communities to help as they begun to safely reopen through a resource guide we created called Sharing What We've Learned: A Blueprint for Businesses. Our blueprint includes actionable recommendations and learnings that we've applied as well as what we've learned through regular interaction with governments, health departments and with business leaders in other countries, including Italy, Singapore and China, all of which were ahead of the U.S. in terms of the pandemic cycling through their countries.
  Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant strategic choices over the last several years to transform our business model and to redefine the customer shopping experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. We've invested aggressively in technology to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, and we've made incremental investments in fresh, our brands and personalization. These investments in our competitive motes helped Kroger build business momentum in the second half of 2015, which continued through the start of our first quarter, even before the first phase of the pandemic began in our operating markets in earnest in March. 
 The benefits of the changes that we've been making to our business model were accelerated by COVID-19. For example, our heavy investments in technology enabled us to reliably sustain the incredible almost overnight increase in demand for our pickup and delivery services. 
 Here are other examples of how the pandemic accelerated Kroger's transformation. As you know, we introduced Kroger's brand transformation campaign, Fresh for Everyone, late in 2019. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have access to fresh, affordable food. This has proven to be even more important during these times. In the initial stock-up phase of the pandemic, customers purchased a lot of paper, cleaning products and center store nonperishable items to fill their pantries. As the first new normal phase began to set in, marked by preparing for extended time at home and often with children, our fresh departments took an even greater relevance as more and more customers turn to fresh produce and proteins as staples of home-cooked meals. Fresh will continue to be an important driver of sales for Kroger as demonstrated by our fresh departments, including meat, seafood and produce, generating strong identical sales in the quarter. 
 Our brands had a great quarter as well and grew 21.1% driven by significant growth across our 3 largest brands. Having identified plant-based foods as a key trend well before 2019, the Simple Truth Plant Based platform continues to deliver strong growth, growing over 32% in the first quarter. In this way, by consistently delivering both value and innovation, our brands will remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages. Because of the continued economic anxiety, we are still offering our customers value through personalization and promotions, leveraging our mailers, mobile app, website and weekly ads. We continue to offer promotions throughout the quarter with a focus on single-item purchases. 
 Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,000 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 97% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery grew significantly during the pandemic. And because of our existing ecosystem, we were able to respond quickly to further expand and enhance our e-commerce services. We were able to quickly offer and promote in demand no-contact delivery and low contact pickup services. We expanded and improved contact-free payment solutions like Scan, Bag and Go and Kroger Pay. We took several steps to support the higher volume of pickup orders, including hiring additional e-commerce associates, adding more order pickup slots and increasing the frequency of communications with customers. We also began testing a grocery pickup-only location in Cincinnati. All of this contributed to a 92% sales growth in digital channels in the first quarter. In April and May, the sales grew in the top triple digits. 
 We continue to invest in and constantly improve our e-commerce capabilities. Our partnership with Ocado remains an essential part of our evolving seamless ecosystem. Our customer fulfillment centers will accelerate our ability to serve customers seamlessly and in a more cost-effective way. Earlier in June, we identified 3 new regions: the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and the West for placement of our high-tech sheds. When operationally, these facilities will collectively create more than 1,000 new jobs with the potential for hundreds of additional career opportunities. 
 As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate and rapidly -- sort of rapidly changing consumer markets. We are designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large-sized facilities. You can see this strategy taking shape in the new automated CFCs which will span a range of sizes. The new facility in the West will measure 300,000 square feet. The new facility in the Pacific Northwest will measure 200,000 square feet, and the facility in the Great Lakes region will measure 150,000 square feet. The varying sizes demonstrate the flexibility of the Ocado fulfillment ecosystem to best serve the respective markets. Our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same day or next day, delivery or pick up and customer or store replenishment. 
 Kroger has been investing to raise wages for our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, Kroger is increasing associate wages incrementally by approximately $800 million per year through the end of 2020, and this is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. 
 Because of these investments our -- and our established human capital management processes, we were able to expediate our hiring processes in early March to shorten the time between application and employment. Onboarding new hires an average of 72 hours and focusing onboarding on culture and safety, we were able to not only generally protect associate jobs in the face of record unemployment, we also created new jobs and new career opportunities for more than 100,000 workers nationwide. 
 Our expediated hiring and onboarding processes also enabled us to focus on associate and customer safety. We were able to direct immediate support to the expansion of Kroger pickup availability as well as an enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices in our stores and facilities where we needed the help the most. Many of those new roles were bridge jobs providing laid-off workers with a stable job opportunity while furloughed from their previous jobs, many of whom are now returning -- starting to return. Additionally, I'm pleased to note an extension of our human capital commitments. We contributed an additional $236 million to multiemployer pension plans in the first quarter. This investment will help stabilize future associate benefits. 
 We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training, promoting internal talent while simultaneously hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. 
 Kroger remains committed to diversity, equity and inclusion with our workforce. We are creating more opportunities for our associates to openly share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with discrimination and for our company and leaders to more deeply and deliberately listen. We will continue to educate and show our leaders and associates how to be more empathetic, supportive and aware of our own unconscious biases so that, together, we can build a better and more inclusive Kroger. 
 COVID-19 also accelerated our commitment to integrated ESG or sustainability practices. What we are seeing in our communities during the pandemic confirms that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission is more relevant than ever. During the pandemic, more than 80 million people in the U.S. lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits and/or food assistance. Many more families are struggling to put food on the table today. Kroger is using our philanthropic dollars and foundations to support our food banks and other key partners. Additionally, we are now accepting SNAP/EBT benefits as payment for our pickup service, allowing more customers to access fresh, affordable food through e-commerce. 
 We also implemented a dairy rescue support program for farmers. Many farmers and producers did not have a market for their products as foodservice, hospitality and restaurants remain closed. We operate 17 dairies around the country and are uniquely positioned to offer our processing capabilities. Manufacturing and dairy procurement teams rapidly scaled a program to rescue surplus milk donated by Kroger's dairy cooperative suppliers and processed by Kroger-operated dairies and directed it to food banks and families in need. 
 Kroger is a trusted brand, and our #1 priority is to be there for our customers, associates and communities. We understand the transition to a new normal will not happen uniformly across the country. As America enters the next phase, we're using our own customer insights and monitoring the impact of affected global markets to help us continue meet customer needs. 
 And now I'll turn it over to Gary for more detail into the quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing results for the quarter, I also want to thank our associates for their dedication and all they are doing to serve our customers and communities during this time. The pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how our teams responded as America relied on Kroger as a trusted resource for their food and essential needs. As a result of the pandemic, we have seen elevated demand across our physical stores and digital channels. Our data insights show customers continue to value the convenience of our physical locations and the ease of our seamless ecosystem. 
 As many of you know, we outlined our Restock Kroger transformation plan in 2017. And as part of that plan, we made the strategic decision to invest in digital. These investments allowed us to quickly add much needed capacity to serve our customers by scaling the foundational capabilities we have built and continue to develop. The outcome of these efforts has been a meaningful uplift in sales across all digital modalities: Kroger pickup, delivery and ship. 
 We made significant investments of more than $830 million in the quarter to reward associates and safeguard associates, customers and communities during the pandemic. We also contribute to $236 million to multiemployer pension plans to help stabilize future associate benefits. Even with these significant investments and accelerated digital growth, we were pleased to achieve an improvement in FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We firmly believe that our ongoing investments will help Kroger emerge stronger, and it's clear from our recent customer data insights that our competitive modes, fresh, our brands, personalization and a seamless ecosystem, are even more important as a new normal begins to emerge in food retail. 
 Now I'd like to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $1.22 per diluted share. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 19% during the first quarter. Unprecedented demand for products across grocery and fresh departments led to these strong results. Sales were broadly based across all retail divisions and remained heightened throughout the quarter as customers adjusted to the new restrictions and started preparing and eating more meals at home. Leading into the pandemic, our sales were strong, building momentum from the second half of 2019, February identical supermarket sales, without fuel, were ahead of our internal expectations. 
 During the last few days of February, we started to see a shift in customer behavior as shoppers started stockpiling, and that trend accelerated into March with identical sales of approximately 30%. Sales remained elevated in April and May, both up approximately 20% as customers continue to eat more at home. In the first few weeks of the second quarter, we are starting to see some changes in demand with sales growth becoming more balanced across the store as state restrictions have started to ease. Customers remain focused on health and safety and are still stocking up but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns. We are also starting to see a return to some splurge and impulse buying. Customers are still cooking more at home, even with the easing restrictions and identical sales, so far in the second quarter, are trending in the mid-teens. We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses. 
 Digital sales grew 92% and contributed slightly over 3% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement with our pickup and delivery services spiked significantly during the quarter, and we have been encouraged by early customer repeat usage. Digital sales in the second quarter remain elevated, up triple digits in the first 3 weeks. We continue to invest in digital and offered a fee-free pickup promotion to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time. We were also excited to announce several new enhancements to our digital customer experience, including the launch of our check-in on arrival option for pickup customers and the launch of contactless doorstep delivery. 
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $1.45 billion compared to $957 million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin was 24.3% of sales for the first quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 44 basis points due to sales leverage related to shrink, transportation, warehousing and advertising costs. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which saw significant improvement in the first quarter compared to last year. The OG&A rate increased 51 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. No adjustment was made to this number for COVID-19-related costs. 
 As previously mentioned, during the quarter, Kroger made the decision to contribute an incremental $236 million to multiemployer pension plans. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, fuel and adjustment items, the OG&A rate improved 10 basis points. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 37 basis points due to sales leverage. We do expect some COVID-related costs to continue beyond the first quarter as we continue to invest in associate and customer safety as well as support heightened digital demand. 
 We also made the decision to delay certain Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives to allow our associates to focus on our most important priorities: safety and stocking shelves. We have now started to reintroduce the delayed initiatives while also maintaining our commitment to associate and customer safety. We still expect to achieve the vast majority of the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020. 
 Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. We saw a significant decline in gallons during the quarter as with the national trend. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.13 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.48 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year. And as a result, fuel profitability was a major tailwind in the quarter. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019, and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID-19. 
 Kroger's alternative profit model is built from a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data and is expected to achieve profit growth in 2020. 
 During the first quarter, Kroger Personal Finance experienced lower transactions as customers purchase less gift cards, money services and lottery. Customer activity has started to improve since April as states have reopened. And while we would expect this trend to continue, KPF profit is expected to be lower than our original expectations for 2020. 
 Media experienced a slowdown in late March and April as campaigns were paused to refocus messaging on store and employee safety and certain in-store programs were impacted by stay-at-home orders. Our Media business rebounded strongly in May, and the strength of our digital sales growth has created significant momentum for Kroger Precision Marketing, which is now on track to achieve 50% growth in 2020. We remain confident in the significant potential of alternative profits, especially given the continued growth in traffic across our store and digital ecosystem. Despite short-term headwinds due to COVID-19, we continue to expect alternative profit to be a major accelerator of our model in the future. 
 As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Food 4 Less California and South Carolina during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Roanoke, Little Rock and Houston, as well as Dallas meat clocks.
 Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. 
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We still expect total capital expenditure of between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. 
 Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 1.81 compared to 2.54 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. We expect working capital to improve for the year, although not to the level experienced in the first quarter, which was inflated by the extraordinary sales growth due to COVID-19. 
 Given the uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 and the outlook for the remainder of 2020, we believe it's prudent to maintain financial flexibility in the short term. We remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program. And in the coming months, we will also be evaluating the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2020. The COVID pandemic has dramatically changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. There are still many unknown factors related to the long-term impact of COVID-19 that could influence our financial results for the remainder of 2020, such as continued investments to help our customers and associates; uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior, restrictions and what will be the new normal; and potential long-term shift in customers eating more food at home. 
 In recognition of these factors, it's difficult to predict specific outcomes. And as such, Kroger is not reaffirming or providing new 2020 guidance. While we do expect to exceed the outlook shared in our April 1 business update for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow, the company is not able to forecast the extent of such upside for the reasons mentioned. As we continue to proactively adjust our plans in response to the pandemic, we remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways they value most and that build loyalty. 
 Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We remain confident in our business model as well as our ability to generate strong free cash flow and achieve sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns. 
 In the second quarter, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the trends we've experienced so far in the quarter. We expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range with tailwinds in the supermarket sales, partially offset by continued investments and fuel headwinds. As the longer-term impact of COVID-19 becomes clearer, we are committed to providing more clarity on our expectations for the remainder of the year. 
 I'll now turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I am so proud and deeply grateful for our 0.5 million associates who step forward to be there for our customers and communities when they need us the most. In true Kroger spirit, they have risen to the occasion to each challenge presented with a strong spirit of agility, determination and service to meet the needs of our customers, and these are the exact skills that will ensure the company will remain relevant to our customers in the future. 
 As I shared when we first began this call, we quickly had to adapt to a new way of life. We continue to make progress on the underlying business, even with the recent customer demand tailwinds. We are confident that Restock Kroger has allowed us to reposition our business and to create value for all our stakeholders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Gary, I just want to go back to your -- I guess your -- what you just said about Q2 EPS growth, mid- to high single digit. I think you said mid- to high single-digit EPS growth. Can you just help us understand more some of the headwinds there getting to that level of growth? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think the biggest factor, Rupesh, would be that -- I mentioned it earlier, but just to maybe to give a bit more color on fuel for quarter 1 and how we see quarter 2 potentially shaping up because that would be the -- I think the biggest factor in the numbers. Overall, as I mentioned earlier, when we think about the supermarket business, we're expecting continued strong sales momentum, and we feel good about the ability to manage the margin and the investments that we'll continue to make as a result of COVID-19. 
 I think the biggest factor and the difference between the 2 quarters as we look at the guidance for the second quarter, in the first quarter, fuel has been a significant tailwind for us overall despite the fact that gallons were significantly lower through COVID. As we start to look at Q2, and we'll be cycling margins from Q2 last year, and even though the fuel trend in gallons has continued to gradually get better every week, we're still seeing a decline in year-over-year gallons. And the current trend would be in the sort of mid-teens range of negative growth in gallons, which is consistent with what's being seen in the market. 
 So as we look at the fuel performance in Q2 and what we see today, we're thinking that could be a headwind of anywhere between $50 million to $100 million. So it would be important to think about that as you're thinking about the guidance that we shared for Q2 because that would be the -- I think the primary factor that would despite the continued growth and improvement in performance that we'd expect over the original budget in the supermarket business. Hope that helped. 
Rupesh Parikh: That's great. And then -- okay. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up question. So just on e-commerce. So as you guys look at -- obviously, you have the partnership with Ocado. How does what you've seen recently change your, I guess, your e-commerce plans or investments going forward? 
W. McMullen: I love the question. And if you look at the strategic decisions we've made over the last several years, it highlighted those decisions really paid off in the current environment. Our digital and delivery and pickup business in the last 2 months grew triple digits and continues to grow at that. And to have the ability to grow at that kind of level that quickly, just so proud of the whole team in terms of the foundations that were already in place but also the stores and all the other parts and supply chain on being able to supply and hire people and support that. So we fundamentally believe the long-term trend will continue where people will continually depend more on e-commerce. We certainly have seen that be accelerated. We don't think it will stay at the higher level where it is today permanently, but we do think, fundamentally, the growth has been accelerated and will be higher than where it started before COVID-19 and then grow from there. 
 One of the things that's incredibly important is all the pieces tied together, including Ocado, will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability of that part of the business. As you know, when a customer first switches to online, it typically takes 3 or 4 years before that customer's profitability is the same as when they shop in the store. But what we find is we get a significantly higher share of that customer's total household spend. And there isn't anything that we've seen that wouldn't cause us to believe that the new e-commerce shopper doesn't feel that way, and a lot of those customers are telling us they intend to continue to shop more e-commerce than before, and we would expect to get a higher share of their business. 
 We've also seen a lot of customers new to Kroger come and use our delivery and pickup business, and we're seeing nice repeat purchases from those customers. So all those things cause us to feel good about the things we have in place and feel even better about Ocado and the other pieces that we're working on going forward. 
Operator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: I was going to ask something different, but I wanted to ask you, Rodney. You just made the comment, it takes about 3 to 4 years to achieve the same profits. Do you mean that on an ongoing basis? Or is that lifetime value because over 3 to 4 years, I've purchased enough through the digital channel. And therefore the -- I guess the profit becomes equal? Or on a go-forward basis after year 3 or 4, the variable cost or the actual basket economics of each become even? 
W. McMullen: It's each customer's household. So if you look, obviously, when they first switched to e-commerce, we're spending the labor to pick their order, where before that, the customer spent that labor. What we find is, over time, we continue to get more efficient with our picking operations on picking an order, and the customer spends more money with us, so their total spend increases. So what we find is every -- you'd have to look at every single customer separately. So the customers that first started shopping e-commerce 3 years ago, they're to the point now where their profitability is the same as before they went to e-commerce, but we're getting a higher percentage of their spend. And looking forward, we believe we'll be able to continue to reduce the cost to serve that customer. A new customer starts day 1, so you have that headwind until we are able to earn more of their total household spend. And what we find is we're able to do that. 
Simeon Gutman: Yes. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the 92% growth in the first quarter. Did you say the mix? Or are you surprised by anything about the mix between delivery and pickup? And then anything you can share on how it impacted gross margins or margins broadly? It sounds like if you picked up a lot of new customers, it would be in a pretty dilutive position for that lifetime of the customer, but anything you can share on it, please. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, delivery was a higher growth than pickup, especially during the peak of the COVID cases. As areas have reopened and companies have reopened their offices and things like that, the growths are starting to get more similar. 
 Gary, on the growth, I'll let you answer the growth and the changes there. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure, yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that the way that we see the digital customer behavior flow through in the P&L, it's not a meaningfully different mix in terms of overall pass-through in gross margin rates. Rodney's point earlier, generally, we see customers increase their spend. The basket size increases, and the mix is pretty consistent. The area that would have impacted gross margin would have been more in the fact that we run the fee waiver promotion. So that would have certainly been a headwind in the gross margin category. 
 Really, where we see the bigger impact on digital is Rodney's earlier response around the incremental labor that's involved in picking the order. So if you think about the pass-through rate that we might see on a traditional sale through the store, which we've talked about historically being the 15% plus range, it would be significantly lower than that on the equivalent basis because you've got the incremental labor associated with those sales. So it would be more of an impact in the OG&A rate than it would be in gross margin when you think about the quarter. 
Operator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Yes. Just, first, a follow-up and then a real question. As we think about Q2, could you just help us out? What are you assuming for IDs in the quarter? What are you thinking about from a continued COVID cost perspective? And how do we think about gross margin relative to what we just saw in Q1? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. There's a couple of parts for that, obviously. I think in terms of sales, as we shared in our brief prepared comments on sales, we're obviously watching the trends very closely. Part of the challenge is it's very hard to know obviously exactly how we expect the customer behavior to return back to whatever a new normal becomes. We certainly expect as states have reopened to start to see a gradual return to some level of lower food eaten at home, but we do think that's going to be more gradual than a specific stair step-down. We're starting to see some change in Q2, as we mentioned during the prepared comments, and -- but it's not really sort of a specific step-down when states have reopened. It's much more of a gradual process as you start to see customers returning to some level of normal behavior. 
 I would also say it's not very consistent. It's not as though states that reopened first are seeing the bigger step-down. It's relatively more tied to when states first experienced a major outbreak of COVID from what we can see and also depending on how aggressive the spike in sales were in that market when the outbreak first happened. That's tending to more correlate with the gradual change in shopping behavior. 
 So we're watching it very closely. We are starting to see visit frequency pick up a bit. We're seeing more of the departments that might be more splurge I mentioned earlier growing like daily baker and specialty cheese and floral, but it really is a gradual process. And I think we still say it's too early at the moment, only a few weeks in to know. So we're expecting it to be a gradual step-down from where we ended Q1 and the trend that we shared so far in Q2. And obviously, we're watching it very closely and maintaining flexibility to make sure we're winning every dollar from a customer perspective around how we make sure we're continuing to grow market share and grow share of wallet. 
 From a gross margin perspective, obviously, we haven't gone into a specific guidance around what we would expect to see there. We continue to invest in promotions, as Rodney shared, and we certainly expect that to become more and more normal as we go through the year now that the supply chain is starting to normalize, but there are still going to be some areas where it will be more difficult to promote where there are still some overhangs of supply issues in certain categories. 
 On the COVID-related costs, it really -- if you think about breaking down the total OG&A expense in Q1, it's really 3 buckets I would kind of categorize it into. The first would be the COVID-specific costs around the $830 million that we talked about, obviously, in the press release and the prepared comments. The majority of that was around rewarding our associates and making sure that they shared in the success of the quarter. And then there were also some costs associated with incremental labor for cleaning and PPE equipment. We'd certainly be expecting some of those costs to continue as we go through the year with safety being the top priority. We're also obviously investing in labor in supporting our digital growth, and we'd expect that labor to continue as we continue to win that customer and make sure that we're winning their overall loyalty. And the third major cost in OG&A, obviously, with the pension contribution, which we wouldn't be expecting to repeat. 
 So I think it's really in OG&A. The cost that will flow through are going to be the safety and cleaning costs that we'd expect to continue to be investing in and the incremental labor associated with supporting digital growth going forward. 
W. McMullen: One other comment, Ed, on the first part of your question, and it's hard to assign specific numbers and specific numbers just for the second quarter versus third quarter, fourth quarter and even 2021. But when we talk to customers, we -- our customers still tell us they plan to eat more meals at home than before. When talking to customers about when their children return to schools, we still have a significantly higher percentage of families telling us they plan to make breakfast for the kids to take to school and lunch for the kids to take to school. All of those things in terms of what customers are telling us, we would expect there'll be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home that obviously will help support growth as well. 
Edward Kelly: I understand the reluctance to really give ID guidance. But the only thing that I would say is that it does matter if it's mid- to high single-digit EPS growth on a double-digit ID versus a single-digit ID from an investment perspective. So to the extent that you can help out with that, that I think would matter to how people are looking at your story. 
 The other thing that I needed to ask about is the pension contribution because I think people are getting kind of hung up here. The $200-plus million contribution that you made this quarter, I believe that relates to that group of 4 meat plants that you essentially kind of control and take in-house. Is that right? 
Gary Millerchip: That's right. So think of it as it's a green status plan. It's over 80% funded, so there's not an obligation for us to make that payment. But obviously, it's something that we're committed to making sure that, long term, we're securing that future liquidity of the plant. And especially during times like this when there's market volatility, sometimes there could be pressure on those plans to have to liquidate assets to be able to make contributions, and we wanted to make sure that the plans were not put in that risk. So we decided to basically invest those dollars now to protect the future. And obviously, over time, that will derisk the need for us to have to invest, but it wasn't a requirement to make those payments. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. So it sounds like that's pretty funded at this point, so maybe we don't see that type of contribution going forward. The other plans that you have is you have a -- you're obviously in the traditional map, right, with other grocers, which is negotiated, and there's no real reason for you to make one-off contributions like this into those plans. Isn't that right? 
Gary Millerchip: That's correct. Yes. The only way that we would approach those examples would be if we identified an opportunity to be able to pull away from the multiemployer plans and bring them into the same way that we run that UFCW plan if there was a -- if it made sense for us to do that from an investor and associate perspective because we could derisk the future liabilities and be able to take more control of that potential exposure in the future But we have no obligation on those, unless we were to make -- take that action like we did with the plan you described earlier. 
Edward Kelly: Right. And your defined benefit plan, the corporate one, is frozen now, right? 
Gary Millerchip: That's right. Exactly, yes. That's fully funded. 
Operator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Karen Short: Just following up on that. So the actual -- can you give us an update on what the actual liability is on the multi-employer pension in dollars pretax? And then with this contribution that you just made, is there -- do we adjust -- and I know you haven't given the annual P&L and cash impact of the multiemployer pension contribution for many years. But -- are we think -- like when we think about modeling it, beginning 2Q, does that actual expense dollar amount come down based on the contribution you just made? And then I had a totally separate question. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. So it depends on which piece of the plan, just to clarify, Karen, you're talking about. So as Ed mentioned a moment ago, we have a multiemployer plans that we separated and we now manage internally. And as I mentioned earlier, they would be in the green status, so there'd be no obligation for us to be making those payments, but we're obviously looking to get them over time a fully funded status and to minimize the risk to associates. So think about that as it's minimizing. If returns weren't where they needed to be, it minimizes the risk as of us having to make contributions in the future and ensures those pension plans are in a strong position for our associates. 
 The multiemployer plans that we're a participant in but we don't have a current obligation to fund beyond the annual contributions that we're making through our negotiated contracts with the unions, that would be an exposure as of the end of last year and as we reported in the 10-K, $2.3 billion or $1.8 million after tax. And they're ones where, over time, we would certainly look at if there are options to figure out different ways to structure our arrangements so that we can address those liabilities, but they would be very specifically defined and ring-fenced transactions that we would obviously share publicly in the future, if we were to decide that was the right thing to do. 
Karen Short: But as we think about the actual expense on the P&L beginning in 2Q, I know, again, you don't guide to that anymore, but how should we think about that? 
Gary Millerchip: Expense related to what, I'm sorry, Karen, I'm not sure I'm following. 
Karen Short: Well, the multiemployer expense. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. So we -- as I mentioned, we would have pension expense related to our multiemployer plans that we pay into as part of the negotiated contracts with the unions. And obviously, where we need to continue to fund the plan that's internal, we'll make those contributions when we need to. But we -- obviously, that can vary significantly. But most of the most of the pull -- if I call it, pull forward may be a potential liability in the future, it doesn't relate to what we would do in 2020. 
Karen Short: Okay. Got it. And then just looking at digital, in terms of your overall digital, would you just be able to give us what your actual percent of sales in digital was in 1Q? And then what the split was between -- I guess, click-and-collect and third party, which I would say is mostly Instacart? 
 And then the last question I had was just on your cash balance of the $2 billion, just thoughts on that. 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look in terms of overall, digital would have been, I don't know, probably 6.5% or 7% of the total company. It would have been predominantly pickup versus delivery in terms of the mix, but the percentage growth was higher on delivery. So -- and if you look at -- the other thing on delivery, a lot is delivered directly to people's homes, either through FedEx or UPS. And that's basically the similar number is what is delivered via Instacart and other services. 
 On the other piece, Gary, I'll let you answer Karen's other. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Sorry, we were all looking to get the digital number for you there, Karen. Can you repeat the second part of the question? 
Karen Short: Oh, just on the cash balance. I mean you guys haven't had a cash balance like that for a while. So thoughts on where you're at in terms of deployment of that? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we -- certainly, we're thrilled with the cash balance that we generated during the quarter. Part of that does reflect the improved operating performance. Part of it was a significant improvement in working capital. We want to make sure that, obviously, we maintain maximum flexibility in the short term, just with some of the uncertainty that still exists in the market. And we also want to make sure we understand how much of the working capital benefit will continue because we do believe we've made strong progress on working capital over the last really 12 months to 18 months as we've continued to look at ways to free up cash flow, but some elements of that will be inflated, just because of the higher sales in the first quarter and the way our working capital cycle works. And some of it is also related to the CARES Act, where there's a delay in certain tax payments as part of the way that the CARES Act was structured. So we would expect as a result of all of that still to generate incremental free cash flow this year. 
 As we go through the next couple of months, we're really going to focus on what do we think is the optimal way to use that cash flow consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy that we shared with you in our Investor Day in November. So think about is we'll look at are there opportunities where we could continue to invest in the business to drive longer-term growth. We'll certainly be looking at are there any reasons to restructure any of the pension future MEPP liabilities that would allow us to take that potential liability and risk off the table longer term. And then, of course, we'll also be looking at how might we redeploy that cash to our shareholders consistent with our strategy of continuing to grow our dividend over time but also looking at buybacks to shareholders as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: One, a little bit more long term. You guys probably have some of the best data analytics on your customer base in the industry. So when Rodney mentioned kind of the habits of newer customers and specifically new e-com customers, right, how could you see the opportunity to further monetize or kind of gain further loyalty from new and existing customers kind of beyond the pandemic, right? If you assume that people are going to eat a little bit more at home and that you have the ability to kind of incentivize your customers to do a little bit more than that, how does maybe next year look for you relative to where you may have thought it would be before the pandemic? 
W. McMullen: Yes. We love the question, and it's something that we're spending a ton of resources. We had as many new customers come to us in a couple of weeks as what we did all of last year, and we continue to have a lot of new customers. So we're using all the things that we would normally do on welcoming new customers in but doing it in a much more aggressive way. Obviously, one of the things that we want to make sure is they have a great experience. So if you look at our supply chain team working with our merchants, we're getting the stores inventories back up to pre-COVID levels. So the in-stock position improves. The continued focus on fresh and continuing to even -- fresh was a priority already, but making sure that the products that customers get stays fresh and then with a friendly smile or an incredibly easy digital experience. 
 So your question, we love, it's the opportunity that we have in front of us. So far, we've been able to gain good market share during the pandemic. And obviously, we're going to continue to focus on making sure we take care of those customers and keep them and continue to build their basket in terms of what they spend with us versus other places. 
Gary Millerchip: Judah, the only thing I would add is that, to your point around data, we spent a lot of time looking at the data that we have and also the data that's available in the marketplace over the last 20 years from whether it's government data, more broad market data, along with our own shopping information, and really looking at what are the scenarios around where we see the customer going over, to your point, not really the next sort of month or 2 but the rest of the year and into next year and maybe even further out. 
 We do feel from everything that we see that we're putting ourselves in a strong position based on the investments that we're making as part of Restock Kroger to come out the other side of this in a stronger place. And everything that we see, while this obviously no one knows and it's hard to predict, would say that based on the -- less around maybe the pandemic but just on generally when customers are in more of an economically challenged situation and combining that with these restrictions, we do think there'll be some level of a -- I won't call it a permanent shift but a multiple-year shift to food eaten at home versus food away from home, and that's been very much the case in our data and the external data when you look at the last couple of recessions. 
 So our focus is very much on how do we make sure we're using personalization and tools and our strategy around creating value to really make sure that as we look out 12, 18 months, we come out of this in a stronger position, both in customers consuming more food at home but also Kroger's market share, so that it allows us to accelerate our overall long-term model around Restock Kroger but also delivering shareholder value. And we feel very positive about the way in which we believe we can deliver that over longer term. I think it's easier to look at the longer term in some ways than it is probably for the next 6 months and how exactly the trends will play out. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up on kind of 2 items that maybe we could clean up a little bit. Just first on the pension. In terms of go-forward expense that's hitting the income statement, that hasn't changed at all. Just what's running through the income statement is what you're required to contribute to those external net plans? Is that right? 
 And then second, for the gross margin in Q2, is there still a headwind from alternative profits being a little bit slower than they would be? And is there also some benefit from promotions not being fully back to where you'd expect them to be? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. On the pension side, yes, so the payment that we're making in Q2 is a discrete payment that we -- sorry, in Q1, I'm sorry, that we deliberately took the decision as we were in a strong position from a performance perspective and a cash flow perspective. We have no obligation to make that payment. It doesn't cause us to have to make payments later in the year or that we are obligated to some additional commitments later in the year. It was very much a decision that we made to take advantage of the strong performance and essentially protect that future risk and make sure that our associates' pension plans are in a strong position. So it's very much more of a forward-looking view of saying let's make sure we're putting ourselves and putting our associates in a position where we're protecting the future when we have the opportunity to do so. 
 From a gross margin perspective, yes, certainly, I think on the alternative profit side, I mentioned it earlier. On the Media business, we're seeing a tremendous pickup in growth. So I wouldn't believe that we would see any headwinds from media. That's continuing to bounce back very strongly from a very temporary delay that we experienced in the first quarter, really during the lockdown period and as things were reset. Kroger Personal Finance is the biggest element of alternative profit from a profit contribution perspective, and that is sort of more, I guess, dependent on some of the broader recovery in the market when you think about gift card sales, restaurants are an important part of that category. 
 And when you think about credit card spend, those elements are all tied to continued improvement in the economic situation. So while we are still able to tap into opportunity in KPF because we have low penetration of our customer base, we would expect that to continue to be a headwind in terms of impacting gross margin and performance for the year. But media, certainly, we wouldn't have that same view there. 
W. McMullen: And we would expect to continue to do promotions. And one of the things when you look at the details behind first quarter, almost basically all the gross margin improvement was driven by leverages and marketing expense from the higher sales, warehouse and transportation and shrink, and our team had incredible strong quarter on shrink. So it's really those leverage, and we would expect continue to have some of those leverage benefits at the higher sales that we're expecting. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Recognizing that it takes several years for a digital customer to become as profitable as an in-store customer, what will be the margin impact over the next 3 years if your digital penetration remains where it is today? 
W. McMullen: It's a great question. And I can tell you before COVID-19, our digital business has become a tailwind in terms of the incremental improvement from where it was before. And as we look forward, we would expect as customers mature that, that would still be the case. And that's going to be a combination of customer spending -- and I'm talking about in total, not just the new customers by themselves. In total, as that customer continues to give us more of their total share of spend for a household and as our teams continue to take costs out in terms of serving that customer and as our Ocado sheds begin to take -- come online and some of the other facilities to supply our customers, we would expect that digital will be a tailwind for us as we move forward, and it's really just the fact that the business basically doubled overnight. 
Michael Lasser: And you mentioned that you're building all different types of Ocado shed. The first one are large ones in different parts of the country. What has the learnings from this experience influence -- how it influenced the sheds that you're going to create moving forward? 
W. McMullen: It's really if you look -- as we've been working on it in total, and Ocado has done a lot of work to be able to get the economics viable for a smaller shed, over time, that will allow us to go into smaller markets with those -- with sheds as well. So it's part of the overall supply chain design, and it's playing out as we expected. And Ocado is continuing to up their game as well. So it's really the experience. We're looking forward to Ocado's sheds opening up in Canada and France, and that will provide an additional set of learnings as well. 
Michael Lasser: And if I could add one last one. I know this is hard to tease out from the data, but you have a lot of really good information. What have you been able to discern about different meal occasions that are now being eaten at home? So as consumers return to work and eat more of their meals at restaurants around where they work, to what degree is that going to result in the slowdown in the IDs that you're experiencing? Similarly, maybe you can tease out how soups and salads are doing versus something you might eat at dinner, where dinner could also slow as we go to those families more. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- overall, we're still seeing people shop at fewer stores and, as Gary mentioned, a large spend per basket. If you look at the department, that's probably the easiest directly to talk about is our deli department. And our deli department, the trends over the last 4 or 5 weeks have been significantly improved from where it was in the height of the lockdowns. We would expect a lot of those meals are things where people are preparing at home and taking to work. Our customers tell us they're still minimizing the different places they go and minimizing their exposure. So that's something that we want to make sure that we're there for the customer. 
Operator: The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. 
Spencer Hanus: This is Spencer on for Greg. I understand that the situation still remains pretty fluid. But can you just provide some additional color on what you think the new normal looks like for food retail? And do you think COVID has accelerated a structural shift towards sort of eating at home channel? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- first of all, if you look at things that we think, for sure, is the digital channel and people eating via that accelerated the trends that we're already on. If you look at like our Home Chef business, they had an incredible quarter with picking up new customers as well. 
 The thing that I get most hopeful about is when we talk to customers, customers tell us they like eating at home as a family and eating together and having meals together at home. And one of our responsibilities is to help them keep it fresh and innovative and new ideas, and we continue to work on that. But everything that we can see, the customer likes that, and they like learning how to cook and cook as a family. So that trend is something that we focus on a lot and try to make sure we're supportive of it. 
Spencer Hanus: That's helpful. And then we've seen promotions tick down across the industry throughout this crisis. Has COVID changed your philosophy on price investments at all? And then would you expect an acceleration in promotions in the back half of the year? 
W. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that I'm super proud of our teams is we've had an ad and promoted every week during the pandemic to try to help our customers' budget go as far as possible. The only change that we made was we stopped doing the buy 10 for 10s and things like that, that incentivized multiple purchases on items that we're in short supply because we wanted to support as many customers as possible, getting those. 
 We would continue to use our data to understand what's important to the customer and some customers are in different financial situations, whether they lost their jobs or they were able to work from home. And we're supporting both of those customer segments with promotions, loyalty mailings and other offers that are 1:1, in addition to what you can see in an ad, and we think that's an important component to continue to support. 
Gary Millerchip: I think the other thing I would add, Rodney, is that we mentioned earlier around the pickup fee being an investment in price with the promotion there. But also, we did adapt our plan around making sure we're giving value to customers where product was more available. And so the team did a really nice job in promoting on HBC and general merchandise products. And while it's very true to say that grocery and fresh led the way, we saw significant double-digit growth in both of those categories and would have seen some lower gross margin in those 2 categories because we were more promotional in making sure that as being a business that was opened through the pandemic that we were delivering value for customers. I think that's been -- the team did a really nice job of making sure we were creating value there and delivering value there. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I'll just ask 1 because I know we're late. You talked about some of the trends in states that reopened first. Maybe too early, but what are you seeing in states where there are headlines about a second wave or cases increasing? Have you seen any upticks there? Or again, is it just too early to say for sure? 
W. McMullen: I think it's too early to tell for sure, and those were states where people were more comfortable going out, anyway, even during lockdowns. So it's really early to -- but we're really not seeing massive shift changes. 
 One last question. 
Operator: And that question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. 
Michael Montani: Just want to see if -- can you hear me? 
W. McMullen: Yes. 
Michael Montani: Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So the question I have was 2 parts. The first was on traffic and ticket. I know you don't typically disclose that, but if you could give some incremental color around the 19% ID sales on that line? And then secondly, related to that was just if there's a sense of what percentage of that comp is being generated by existing loyal households versus the new households. Obviously, you had mentioned, Rodney, there was some strong growth in new customer acquisition. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at -- on the ticket growth, we had significant double-digit increases in the average basket size. And we're finding that customers are going into the store less frequently, and so well over 100% of the growth is driven by basket size. If you look at new customers and existing customers, it's a meaningful number, but it's maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the total when you look at all the pieces because we also have a lot of new customers to pick up and where we've launched where customers can pay a SNAP at pickup and things like that, new customers there as well. 
Michael Montani: Okay. And then I guess the other one I had was a lot of the questions I've been getting relate to how you all would be positioned to cycle this kind of comp in a year from now. And so I was just wondering if you could provide some incremental color around the Ocado partnership and I guess, in particular, as it relates to some of the c-store fulfillments and also like center store potential efficiencies that you could gain and reinvest back into competitive positioning. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- that's a question, obviously, we're spending a lot of time internally talking through and trying to understand as well. The thing that, Gary talked about it a little bit, but if you look at -- we would expect '21 to be better than what the trend would have been for '21 before COVID, and Gary mentioned that briefly in answering one of the other questions. So everything that we can see, we believe there are certainly meaningful shifts in the way people eat. I won't say permanent but certainly multiyear and that we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been before COVID. 
 To give more specifics than that, I think it's hard to say. As we get to next year, one of the things that we would expect is, certainly, in-stock positions will be better, which will be helpful, but people will be going back to a normal life more so as well. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're taking care of the customers we have and getting more of their share in the new customers. And the easiest point of context is just we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been pre-COVID. 
 Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it. I think the last question was a great question to end on. If you look at Restock Kroger and the work from Restock Kroger certainly position the Kroger well to deal, and we had good growth before COVID, and COVID certainly accelerated the infrastructure and foundations we had in place. And as we look to 2021, we would expect that to be better than what it was before COVID. 
 The other comment that I want to make is, as you know, we always like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates and how we live our purpose every day. The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many more, too many more across our country have shaken me to the core. We share in everyone's feelings of sadness and outrage for the victims and their families. I am compelled to use Kroger's voice to express that we're against racism and the injustice toward the Black community. To become a greater part of the solution, we believe the most important next step is to listen. 
 Recently, I was proud to be invited by Dr. Bernice King of The King Center to listen, learn and participate in open dialogue about how companies like ours can drive real tangible change. We also held the first of several listening sessions to hear directly from our associates about how we can better support them. Informed by deliberate listening, we intend to take more action. As the first step, our company is establishing a $5 million fund to support the advancement of racial equality and justice. This new investment will be earmarked within The Kroger Foundation for improving diversity, equity and inclusion. We know there's more work to be done, and we will continue to share our progress. 
 Thank you for all you have done and will do for each other and our customers and communities. And to all on the call, thank you for joining our call today. Thank you very much. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-03-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Company Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and 2019 fiscal year results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
 We were pleased with our 2019 results and improving trends in our supermarket business. As a result of our customer obsession and renewed intensity around operational excellence, we delivered our commitments for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, cost savings and delivered over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019. 
 For the full year 2019, we delivered on the total shareholder return, or TSR, model that we outlined at our Investor Day and are positioned to deliver on our TSR model of the future, where you're using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, positioning our business for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns. 
 We continue to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.1 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase the dividend to create value for shareholders. In total, we returned $951 million to shareholders in 2019. Our confidence that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future is guided by our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth. 
 By executing against the Restock Kroger framework, we are repositioning our business by widening and deepening our competitive moats. The 4 main areas of Restock Kroger framework, redefine the customer experience, partner to create value, develop talent and live our purpose, continue to be a top strategic priority for us. We're continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats today, which are product freshness and quality, Our Brands and personalize rewards and our competitive moat of tomorrow, the seamless ecosystem we are building.
 Fresh continues to be an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Again, our produce department's strong identical sales for the quarter demonstrated how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. Our Fresh for Everyone campaign has been well received and is driving significant improvements in marketing effectiveness. It is also driving more trips to our seamless ecosystem in-store and online.
 Our Brands achieved its best year ever, exceeding $23.1 billion in sales. We introduced 758 new Our Brand items in 2019, which helps drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. 
 Since its launch in 2013, Simple Truth has become the leading natural and organic brand in the country with annual sales exceeding $2.5 billion in 2019. After identifying plant-based foods as a key food trend well before 2019, we introduced the Simple Truth Plant Based collection in 2019, and that launch is off to a strong start. The Simple Truth brand expanded into plant-based meats with Emerge grinds and patties in January. In only 1 month, these products ranked third in the category for the entire fourth quarter.
 Our Private Selection brand eclipsed $2 billion in sales for the first time. The Kroger brand exceeded $13.7 billion in sales capitalizing on product development around key customer trends like global and regional flavors. 
 Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem that combines the best of the physical store experience with the digital customer experience for our customers. This is where customers are increasingly going to meet their needs. We know our customers value the greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an -- central component of driving overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth and share of wallet as well. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anywhere, anytime from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion. 
 Our approach to partnerships is simple, but not simplistic. We think they work best when the 2 of us can do things together that neither of us could have done alone. We're roughly a year away from our first fully functional customer fulfillment center with Ocado in Monroe, Ohio. These facilities will accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience in a much more cost-effective way. We continue to be excited about the partnership. As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just on its current capabilities, but also how quickly the company is able to innovate and serve rapidly changing consumer market. 
 We continue to roll out our plan, and you should not assume just large facilities. We're designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large facilities. Our network will flex as demand matures, and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and the customer or store replenishment. 
 As America's grocer, we continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger and have made significant investments in our associate wages. The investments Kroger is making in human capital is putting more money in our associates' product -- pockets today. Our investments in associate wages has increased Kroger's average hourly rate to $15 an hour in 2019. And with our comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We are working hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training and promoting internal talent while, at the same time, hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. 
 In addition to investing in American workers and communities, Kroger is also leading the effort to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate all waste across the company through our award-winning Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. We made this bold commitment rooted in our purpose because we fundamentally believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, work for and invest in companies that are purpose-driven and are actively making the world a better place. 
 In these ways, Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders, both today and in the future. Our focus on the strategic drivers is expanding Kroger's competitive moats and will drive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. 
 And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details in the quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As I get started, I'd like to remind you of the key themes we shared during our Investor Day. Our model is built upon a strong and durable base driven by our retail supermarkets, fuel and health and wellness businesses. It begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. Our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers drive increased identical sales without fuel across our store and digital ecosystem. 
 To drive sustainable sales growth, we continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to our customers. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience with an even greater emphasis on our competitive moats: fresh, Our Brands and personalization, plus the moat we are in the process of building, our seamless ecosystem. We also committed to be very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business. 
 Our full year 2019 results demonstrated clear progress towards delivering on this model and generating consistently strong and attractive total shareholder returns. Identical sales without fuel grew 2% in 2019. While first quarter results came in below our identical sales guidance range, the balance of the year came in at the top end of our guidance at 2.25%. Adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion came in at the top end of our guidance range and demonstrated the strength of our multi-faceted business model with industry-wide retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds offset by strong fuel results. 
 We demonstrated financial discipline by balancing investments in our customers, associates and the development of our seamless ecosystem with significant cost savings. This was evidenced by our improvement in OG&A rate of 29 basis points, more than offsetting our investment in gross margin rate of 23 basis points during 2019. We achieved over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings in 2018. We also have clear line of sight to $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods for sale and goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies. 
 We also achieved over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019 and delivered FIFO net operating profit growth within our 3% to 5% target range shared at Investor Day. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.19, the middle of our guidance range. Finally, we generated strong adjusted free cash flow, which we have used to pay down debt and bring our leverage ratio to within our target range and reintroduced share repurchasing in the fourth quarter. 
 Now I'd like to provide commentary on Kroger's fourth quarter results. We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 per diluted share of 18.8%. LIFO charge for the quarter was $36 million compared to a LIFO credit of $10 million for the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our corporate tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2% compared to 20.8% for the same period last year. This decrease resulted from an increase in tax deductions. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $758 million, up 20.7% compared to $628 million in the fourth quarter in 2018. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2% during the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed in our supermarket business, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. 
 The underlying trends in the business was strong. November and December identical sales were consistent with third quarter performance. As expected, January was negatively impacted as we lapped incremental SNAP dollars in the market in January 2019 and we experienced milder weather this year. February bounced back nicely and performed in line with our expectations and slightly ahead of the trend in the third quarter and November and December. As a reminder, we do expect SNAP to positively impact the first quarter of 2020 as we lap a 15 basis point headwind from prior year. We expect identical sales in 2020 to improve over 2019 as we drive increased customer loyalty through fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. 
 Digital contributed approximately 75 basis points to identical sales without fuel. Kroger pickup and delivery continue to grow in a faster pace than our overall digital growth. During the 2019 holiday season, we offered a limited time free pickup promotion in select markets. Customers responded positively to the promotion, and we were pleased with our fourth quarter digital sales growth of 22%. 
 Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the fourth quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 6 basis points. This increase resulted from improvements in cost of goods, accelerated alternative to profit streams and cycling of investments in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by investments in price and personalization, continued industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and growth in the specialty pharmacy business. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the fourth quarter compared to last year. This represents the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement. While retail pharmacy gross margin continued to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, retail pharmacy remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns and strong customer loyalty. 
 OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 79 basis points in the quarter. Part of this was due to cycling of investments in OG&A made in the fourth quarter of 2018, plus broad-based improvements in Restock Kroger savings initiatives. We were pleased with our ability to deliver OG&A improvement above the level of gross margin investment as a rate of sales in 2019, and we expect that balance to continue in 2020. 
 Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement. Our loyal customers received hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards in 2019 in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.58 this quarter versus $2.34 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.34 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the fourth quarter. 
 Alternative profit streams contributed an incremental operating profit of more than $100 million in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to be the primary drivers of growth. Brands continue to invest in Kroger Precision Marketing because we close the loop between media exposure and store and digital sales to make brand advertising more addressable, actionable and accountable. An annual survey by the Path to Purchase Institute gave us strong ratings for effective targeting, measurement, sales growth and ROI. Most recently, we became the first retail media platform to be awarded Platinum Certification by the Trustworthy Accountability Group for meeting guidelines to improve transparency and prevent ad fraud, malware and piracy. We're committed to being the most transparent media organization and making the entire digital media ecosystem a safe and effective investment for CPG brands. 
 As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Memphis during the fourth quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Houston. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2020, including contracts with UFCW for store associates in Dallas, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 We continue to generate strong free cash flow and are being very disciplined in how we deploy it to deliver strong and attractive total shareholder returns. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating and return excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend. In 2019, Kroger reduced our net total debt by $1.1 billion, bringing our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA within our target range. We also returned $486 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $400 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2019 under our $1 billion Board authorization. 
 At our Investor Day, we committed to continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined approach to capital management, and we are focused on ensuring our capital projects deliver strong returns. Consistent with our approach in 2019, the majority of our investments in 2020 will be allocated to driving profitable sales growth, improving productivity and building out our supply chain and seamless ecosystem. We also committed to effectively manage our portfolio of assets to improve ROIC over time. 
 As part of our review process in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge relating to the planned closing of 35 stores across the footprint in 2020. This is reflected in the $52 million of transformation costs recognized during the fourth quarter. As we have shared with you previously, Kroger made the decision to divest our interest in Lucky's Market in the third quarter of 2019, and we took the appropriate impairment charge based on the information available at that time. Subsequently, the decision was made by Lucky's Markets to file for bankruptcy in January, which led us to fully write off the value of our investment and deconsolidate Lucky's Market from our consolidated financial statements. This resulted in a noncash charge of $174 million in the fourth quarter. 
 Kroger maintains liabilities associated with certain property-related guarantees that will result in Kroger making payments to settle these over time. These items have no effect on net earnings per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2020. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2020, building on our momentum in 2019, we continue to expect identical sales without fuel of greater than 2.25%. We also continue to expect adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to range between $2.30 and $2.40. Looking at the cadence of EPS growth in 2020, we expect the first quarter to be below our annual EPS growth range of 5% to 10% as we cycle real estate gains in the first quarter of 2019. Overall, I'm encouraged with the momentum created in 2019, which provides a solid platform from which to deliver on our commitments in 2020. 
 Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we invite your questions, I'd like to say a few words about the coronavirus. From a financial standpoint, it is too early to tell the effect on our business. It is not included in our guidance. And while it is obviously very early for this public health event in the United States, we're not seeing anything so far that would cause us to change our guidance. 
 From a business preparedness standpoint, we have established an internal task force that has activated our pandemic preparedness plan with a focus on our customers, associates and supply chain. We generally believe that we have limited supply chain exposure in China as the majority of the products we source is domestic. We certainly feel for those in America and around the world who have been affected. The health and well-being of our associates, our customers and our communities is Kroger's top priority. Always being there for our communities is part of our heritage and especially in times of uncertainty. We believe everyone deserves to have access to affordable fresh food. 
 Returning now to our business results, I want to stress that Restock Kroger is the right strategic framework to deliver both on our 2020 guidance and to position Kroger for sustainable growth and total shareholder return. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. 
Robert Ohmes: A couple of quick ones. First, just on ClickList with the kind of fee waiver and the response to that and maybe some color, what happens after you put the fee back in and also what are your sort of intermediate term thoughts on keeping a fee versus getting rid of it like some of your competitors seem to have. That would be one. 
 And then just 2 other quick ones, just the pharmacy expectations for 2020 and the fuel profit assumptions in your guidance for 2020. Maybe just give us some color so we can think about those things in our modeling. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Robbie. As Gary mentioned, when you look at the digital promotional offer on the waived fee, overall, we're happy with what we learned. We did engage with some new customers. I think it's important to remember that this was a test among many, many tests that we continue to do. And overall, what we're focused on is really how to create a seamless experience. 
 In terms of going forward, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing our exact plans because, obviously, that will share -- tell our customers -- our competitors, excuse me, what we're planning to do. And the customer behavior was consistent with what we expected. They were happy and the results since then have been consistent with what we expected as well. And overall, I think it's always important to remember what we're really trying to do is build up a seamless experience. And what we find is the better job we do on creating that seamless experience creates a deeper and deeper loyalty strategy. 
 In terms of pharmacy expectations and fuel, Gary, I'll let you answer both of those. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Robbie. So yes, as you think about the model for 2020, I'll maybe refer back a little bit to some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. We very much look at the overall customer ecosystem across our food and grocery business, retail pharmacy business and also the fuel business as an overall how do we manage those multifaceted parts of the model. And I think if you look at our performance in 2019, as I've said in some of the prepared comments, we feel like it's a really good demonstration of how we're managing that model where, really, the pharmacy headwinds that we saw in 2019 were fully offset by the fuel benefits that we saw. And then the sort of foundational food and grocery business was pretty stable within that environment. 
 I would say that as we look towards 2020, we'll be managing the business in a very similar way. When you think about our overall guidance for 2020, we're essentially expecting that ecosystem to be relatively stable overall, and alternative profit will drive us towards the operating profit growth that we've shared for the full year. Within that guidance, we do expect that pharmacy will continue to have some headwinds, nothing to the extent that we saw in 2019. We think the gross margin structural challenges will continue in 2020. But the team has done a great job in continuing to look for opportunities to take out costs where they don't add value for the customer, our associates and looking for ways to improve our cost of goods where we have control over those items. And so we would expect to see less of a headwind, albeit still somewhat of a headwind from pharmacy in 2020. We would also expect fuel, obviously, to start to normalize. And so probably something of a headwind there within the overall model. And really, the way that we cycle those will be through the strength of continuing to improve our ID sales in the core and the $1 billion of cost savings that I talked about overall within the model. So overall, we think about it very much as all those moving parts creating a relatively stable core business from an operating profit point of view in 2020 and alternative profits driving the growth in the year. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Gary's last point on the incremental profit from alternative profit is an important part, I think, to remember as well. And we -- as we shared in our guidance, we expect it to range somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. 
Operator: Next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Two for me. First, I wanted to -- I know it's way too early to -- for you guys to sort of quantify the coronavirus impact, but that won't stop me from trying to ask. And I appreciate -- I would appreciate any help you can give. Can you at least directionally talk about whether it's been a benefit so far in the last couple of weeks? I mean Campbell's Soup yesterday talked about how they are experiencing better orders in the last week or so from some of their customers. We've certainly read about stock-outs of water and so forth. At least directionally, do you think it's been somewhat of a help so far? Or is it really just way too early to say for sure? 
W. McMullen: Personally, and I'll let Gary if he disagrees, I just think it's way too early to say for sure. And the key thing is we -- as I mentioned before, is we want to make sure we're there for our communities, our customers and our associates. And the comments that Campbell's and others have said, certainly, we would see an increase in volume in certain categories. And if you think about a lot of the basics and things that people would need to be able to keep and maintain their health and those things, but it's so early in the process in the United States. And the only pattern that we would have any idea on how to look at it would be China because that is the most -- first developed in terms of going through the impacts. And our -- all of our teams, our stores, our supply chain team, our procurement folks are incredibly focused on making sure that we stay in stock on those critical items in partnering with CPGs and our own supply chain to replenish that. 
 I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I would completely agree with your comment, Rodney, as I think it's really too early for us to really have a sense of how customers' overall behavior will change and what the impact will be as the situation obviously evolves in the U.S. market. 
 I guess just to build on a couple of points, Ken, with the data points that we do see today. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, February was generally in line with what we've expected for the period of the first month, if you like, around new year. So we didn't see anything dramatically different from what we would've expected during that time period. Certainly, the trend has improved over -- slightly over what we saw in Q3 and November and December. So we will have to see that after January was a month that we knew would be a tough one to cycle. And as Rodney mentioned, in the last few days, I think you've seen more in response to the media activity and some of the advice out there in the market of customers starting to spend more on things like water and hand sanitizer, hand soap, paper and then some of the -- maybe the box dinners and soups that you might expect just based on the guidance that's been given to consumers in the market. So there's certainly been heightened activity in that regard. 
 But how that plays out and how it impacts the overall shape of the way customers behave and shop, I think it's really that should be. And I think in the last few days that I would say there's anything different than we would have seen versus what we expected. And how that plays out over a longer period of time is really, I think, impossible to tell. 
Kenneth Goldman: Totally understand. I appreciate that. Can I ask a very quick follow-up? Depreciation and amortization seem to be a little bit higher than most people were looking for this quarter. Gary, can you help us understand or think about how to model that for 2020? What numbers do you have in your internal models? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Sure. And thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- it is an area, Ken, where we saw some lumpiness during the year. Part of that is to do with the fact that as we've been dynamically changing our capital allocation, the average life of some of the investments that we make in technology look different from some of the traditional investments that we would've made in a traditional store remodel or a new store opening. We're still investing in those areas, but the mix is certainly changing over time. As that normalizes out, we would be looking at a range of 3% to 5% as a sort of an annualized increase in depreciation to kind of give you more of a big picture perspective on how to think about 2020, if that's helpful. 
Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: I want to go back to the comments, Rodney, you made about Ocado and the flexibility to just -- to not just assume large facilities. If you can just talk more about the flexibility you guys have to, I guess, have different facility sites and just how you guys are thinking about that flexibility going forward. 
W. McMullen: Yes. As we've talked about before, we really do believe it'll end up being a combination of our physical stores, sheds that are small, medium and large-sized. The ones that we've announced so far have been all large sized. But over time, Ocado continues to spend significant money in R&D and continues to push. So we would expect it'll be a combination of store-based model, smaller-type facilities and bigger-type regional facilities, and Ocado will be a critical partner in that overall ecosystem. And by having those combined, it will also allow us to have the best cost of goods coming into the various sheds and using the total assets that we have today. So we feel really good about the pieces of the puzzle that we're putting together. And we really think the -- and it will support the ability to do both same day and next day. And what we find is, in some cases, customers like same day, some things they like next day. But -- and we're excited. We're really looking forward to the facility in Monroe opening and the second facility in Florida will open soon after that. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And then just one follow-up question. So you -- I guess, you announced the closing of 35 stores. Is this the right way to think about the cadence going forward? Or just maybe just walk us through, I guess, the rationale for these store closures? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question. It's -- I think I've talked a little bit about it at the Investor Day and then in the prepared comments. What we're really focused on is taking a step back and making sure as we think about how the overall portfolio of assets are performing, how do we make sure we're really setting ourselves, that we're making the right investments to accelerate and grow the business but also looking where we have opportunities to optimize the portfolio and to drive, obviously, ROIC over a period of time. 
 I would say that this is very much a sort of a stand-alone review that we've taken a step back and said -- look at stores where -- and the average -- to give you some context around it, the average store age is about 28 years old. So these are, in many cases, older stores. They're geographically spread across the countries. There aren't sort of particular markets that it's focused on. It's very much more about looking at our portfolio and really making sure that we see where the customer is going, where we invest our dollars to really drive and support our customers and how we continue to evolve the whole ecosystem that Rodney referred to in his opening comments, just making sure that we're really being disciplined in investing where we see the future growth in the business. And so it's one of those things that just as part of as we manage the business and look for ways to continue to improve and optimize, we're looking to be very deliberate in making those decisions. 
Operator: The next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Wanted to just talk about just alternative profits and really where trade promotion dollars ended up for the year. And with -- in your conversations with CPG, just curious if you're finding that there is not any cannibalization or plans for cannibalization as this matures? And just updated thoughts there. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll talk broadly, and then I'll let Gary get into the specifics. It's one of the reasons that we partner on the media side of the CPGs and one of the things that we have a very open and transparent relationship going both ways. So we don't want to spend money on Media if the CPG isn't getting a return for it. And that was the reason why we thought it was so important to get the Platinum Certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group, is that we want to make sure that when we invest the CPG money, that we're able to show that they get a return for it. And by making sure that people are getting a return, that's the best protection, to make sure that they're just not moving trade dollars over. And we tell the CPGs it doesn't do us any good if you just move the trade dollars over. What we're trying to do is provide something that you can't get in the marketplace from a media standpoint. 
 We're getting great feedback from the CPGs. We have incredibly high retention rate, and many CPGs continue to expand the amount of money they spend with us. 
 Gary, I'll let you get a little bit more into some of the details. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Rodney. And obviously, I would agree with everything you shared there. I think one of the key things that the team is focused on is really working collaboratively across Stuart Aitken's team, that leads the Media group, and then Joe Grieshaber's team, that leads our merchandising capabilities, to make sure that we really are managing all the moving pieces together. And I would say we feel very good around how those relationships are working to make sure that we're capturing the dollars and really helping support our CPG partners to grow their business effectively through the work that we do in the merchandising group and also through the alternative profit streams with the Media business. 
 I wouldn't say that we see anything that's causing us to believe that as the way this is being managed, that they are very much discrete buckets that are generally being allocated to particular activities. We feel very positive about the progress that we're making there on how we see -- I would probably characterize it as how we see a shock in cost of goods and how it flows through to the gross margin. I would say it's one of the reasons that we called it out in the quarter earnings release of -- we certainly continue to invest in price and personalization for our customers. But the combination of cost of goods benefits and alternative profit streams fully offset that in terms of the impact on gross margin and part of the reason why we were able to see a solid performance on gross margin during the quarter. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just since we were on gross margin a little bit, maybe just another question on pharmacy. So it sounds like the headwind there should moderate a little bit from last year as we look into 2020. But what is the -- what is your long-term expectation there? Does this ever go away? Or is this kind of the new norm? 
Gary Millerchip: I think certainly, our assumption in the model is that we expect -- continue to see pressure in certain parts of the way the pharmacy business is structured. Our focus is on really making sure that we're continuing to improve our operation in a way that ensures that, in addition to all the great things that our pharmacy business do for us today around driving overall customer loyalty and delivering a great experience in the store for customers, that we continue to evolve the way we think about the business model. 
 I mentioned some of the things in one of the earlier comments around how we're taking costs out of the model where that makes sense and doesn't create value for our associates working in that part of the business or for our customers. We've launched a number of new services, like the Kroger's pharmacy program that allows us to be able to deliver more value for the customer, but also to be able to influence more of the dynamics of how the profitability works in the marketplace and to really deliver more value for customers through that program. 
 And then I think the third piece that we talked a little bit about, I think, on a previous call is we truly believe that the power of our data and the overall relationship that we have with the customer potentially opens up opportunities to develop new revenue streams in connecting food to how we deliver our health and wellness services in the store, so thinking about the trend towards food as medicine and how can we connect those relationships even more clearly to help our customers live and eat more healthily when they want to do that, but also to connect into the health care system and helping to take out some of the cost and complexity in that model and generate new revenue streams. 
W. McMullen: We are actively testing where food is actually written under a prescription and helping people live healthier. And when you look at all of that together, we continue to have a great scripts count growth as well. And we really think it's our pharmacy teams and their connections with the patients that's creating that deeper relationship. And as Gary mentioned, when you look at the overall ecosystem, half of health care costs can be affected by the way people eat, and we really believe, with our data, we have the right to help people eat better. 
Operator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: My question around -- my real question for you is if -- Rodney, if we take a step back and just assess the last year and the evolution of the state of the business, your business, your stock's going from $30 to $20 back to $30. This quarter -- it was in the quarter, right, FIFO EBIT, even if you back out the onetime -- the benefits of onetime laps was up, right, despite a tough fuel lap, but you had some tough quarters in core grocery. I guess have you finally turned the corner here? What level of confidence do you have? I'm just kind of curious as to your big picture thoughts on sort of like the last year how things have evolved and your confidence level on the business and where it is right now. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Ed. If you look at overall, as we mentioned before, if you look at the momentum during the year, we felt really good about the progress and momentum during the year, and that's in terms of identical sales and if you look at the operational execution. I think Mike and the whole team really have done a great job on those areas. We're really taking care of the customer. We continue to aggressively invest in the seamless experience. And if you look at the alternative profit, it continues to come as we expect it would. 
 So that's -- when you look at all those things together is what gave us confidence to continue to support the guidance we gave in November on EPS of $2.30 to $2.40. We expect the business to continue to generate good cash, strong free cash flow while, at the same time, continuing to aggressively invest capital in a seamless experience. So when you look at all those things together, as you know, the last 2 or 3 years, we've been working hard on transforming our fundamental business model, and we feel like we've made significant progress on that and continue to invest in the future from a digital experience. So we're excited about where we are. We're even more excited about where we're headed. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And I just wanted to ask you a question about share repo and expectations for 2020, especially Q1. I mean Q1's a big cash flow quarter. It seems like share repo is back on. Historically, you bought a lot of stock in Q1. Just thoughts on how we should be thinking about that in the coming years for modeling? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. So obviously, I mentioned a little bit around this in the prepared comments. We committed that as we continue to see strong free cash flow generation, which is a core part of our total shareholder return model, we are committed to continuing to buy back stock as part of the model. As you know, we had a $1 billion authorization from the Board. And as long as we continue to deliver on the performance of the business that we expect and generate the strong free cash flow that we've guided to during the year while also maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio within that target range to support our commitment to our investment-grade rating, we would expect to be continuing to buy back stock within the overall authorization that we have. 
 I would say that the way that we're approaching it is very much in a structured way. We're not specifically trying to time the market in some way. It's much more based on a grid approach to how we determine and look at the intrinsic value of the stock. And then we'll put a grid in place to make sure that, over time, if there are opportunities to buy back, we will certainly be executing on that plan throughout the year. 
Operator: The next question is from Christopher Mandeville with Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: I guess as it relates to some of the expense control measures found within Restock, can you flesh those out a little bit more specifically? How much of this is related to possibly some head count reductions at the store level or even some reductions in store hours for that matter? Reason why I bring it up is because we have been hearing certain regions have seen some layoffs at the assistant store manager level, and there's been some reductions in hours of operations. So maybe you could just kind of talk about that a little bit and then to what extent maybe some of those reductions are being offset by wage increases that you're putting forward to your associates. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So as we mentioned in some of the prepared comments, that the quarter 4 result obviously did include some cycling of increased investment that we made in Q4 2018. And so some of that is certainly expected, and I know we guided to that as part of what we shared in the EPS expectations when we shared what we thought the cadence would look like throughout 2019. 
 We're really seeing the improvements across a broad wave of activity across Restock Kroger. I listed out many of them in the prepared comments, whether it's -- some of the biggest areas would be in goods not for resale as example, where we're sourcing products better and we're managing to really make sure that we're finding opportunities to be more efficient in the way that we're buying and joining the dots across all the different pieces of procurement across the organization. 
 Certainly, we're leveraging technology and automation to make sure that we're taking work away where it doesn't add value for the customer. A good example of that might be in cleaning, where it's something that can be done more efficiently and allow our associates to really focus on serving the customer and doing work that the customer really values. 
 And then of course, we did announce last quarter that we did make some structural changes to really simplify the work in our divisional offices to make sure that we're, again, putting our associates and talent closer to the customer in these key store management roles and, at the same time, reducing duplication in work so they can make decisions more quickly and respond and serve the customer more effectively. 
 So I think we feel very good about it. It's a good balance across the way that we're managing the cost base. Certainly, as we look at the performance of our stores, one of the things that -- building on maybe Rodney's comment to the last question that was asked around confidence in the model, we're very excited about as we see our stores continue to execute at a higher level and continuing to deliver improvements in the fresh experience, the friendly experience and our in-stock position and how we're delivering on Kroger pickup. So we're very focused on making sure our stores are in a good place to be able to deliver on the experience that we know our customers are looking for. And some of those are the reasons why we feel confident as we're guiding to higher ID sales in 2020, because of the great work our store associates are doing in delivering for our customers. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then just my follow-up, it's maybe a little bit too early. But in the areas where we've seen some of the natural organics, not named Lucky's shutter and then with Ahold Delhaize pulling Peapod out of the Midwest, have you realized any benefits already? Or maybe you could just talk about how you're planning to be positioned to capitalize on the share being up for grabs? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Christopher. If you look at natural and organic, it continues to be one of the highest growing areas. And we really think it's something that, over the years, our teams have done a great job on continuing to make sure we have the most recent product things on trend. The example that I talked about in the prepared remarks in Simple Truth and plant-based. So for us, we're incredibly excited about natural organic. It's grown above the company average for several years, and we would expect it to continue to do that. 
 Anytime market share becomes available, we're going to fight for making sure that we get our fair share plus some. And we certainly feel good about what we're getting, and we'll continue to focus on taking care of our customers. Because when our associates are able to take care of the customers, it turns out really well. 
Operator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Simeon Gutman: Rodney, you mentioned on the free pickup that you were pleased with some of the customer satisfaction, I think. Can you tell us, was it a reasonable assumption? Or did you assume that your business would accelerate offering that feature? And was that the case? Did your overall business grow because of it? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It did pick up. And as I mentioned, we did get some new customers. Overall, it was kind of what we expected it to be, and we did it so we can continue to learn. And I think the thing that's important is at any point in time, we'll probably have 20 or 30 different types of tests going on. And the key will be identifying those tests, when you put them together, that create something that's not easily that a competitor can duplicate and it really creates something new for the customer. 
 One of the things that's always our strength is our incredible strength on fresh product. And our customers tell us that relative to our big traditional competitors, we score very well. And we think things like that and the service that our associates provide is equally as important. 
Simeon Gutman: Yes. And I guess just checking on some websites, it looks like it's still being offered. I think you may have mentioned you're not going to divulge if that's your strategy. And just tied to it, Ocado, broadly. And I guess, it's early but you still haven't opened the first facility yet. But do you think in this world of click and collect and delivery, that this Ocado model, you could be able to offer these services for free as a -- as table stakes and still have pretty good economics on doing those type of fulfillments? 
W. McMullen: Yes. When you look at Ocado and the combination of our physical -- existing physical stores, we think we'll be able to offer the customer an incredible customer experience and convenience based on what they want. The fee part won't be -- isn't the major driver of making the economics of that work or not. And whether we charge a fee or not will really depend on what's the market opportunity. But Ocado is incredibly efficient. 
Operator: And our final question today is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: Rodney, if you think about the $1 billion of cost saves, right, and the core business ex alternative profit being flat, so that -- you think about that $1 billion going to cover normal inflation in OG&A and then investments in the business, would you think that would be a 50-50 split in terms of how that $1 billion get spent? And then do you think there's another $1 billion more or less in 2021? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'd say -- I'm trying to do the math in my head as you were asking the question. If you look, we would certainly believe there's opportunities in 2021. We really haven't done the in-depth analysis for -- to be able to say what do I think the specific number is. One of the things that I think is interesting on cost saves and process changes, the more we learn how to do it, the more that we find. So we would be very excited about continuing to identify opportunities to simplify our business and take complication out, which every time we do, it saves money. 
 In terms of -- we would -- I don't know that we would say 50-50. I guess what we're looking to do is making sure that we deliver the TSR that we outlined in November at our investor meeting. And the cost saves, along with our -- and continued improvement from our seamless customer experience, in terms of that becoming a bigger tailwind, all of that together is what allows us to be confident and make the commitments we did on TSR. 
 I don't know, Gary, any specifics that you would want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: No. I would agree with your points, Rodney. I think in terms of the cost savings, as you mentioned it, for me, many of the opportunities that we still see out there are around how we can continue to use technology more effectively and really simplify the design of the work to make it easier for our associates to be successful in the role. And that often means, as you know, John, is we're often reinvesting them in other areas of the store experience and the digital experience. So that net-net, it doesn't necessarily translate through to a total saving in cost because what we're often doing is redeploying those savings into new ways to either improve the experience or to meet the customer where they're at. So it is -- back to Rodney's comment on the what's inflation versus what's incremental is a little bit more difficult as the world's get blurrier around what are the minimum expectations of the customer and where things like average wage going in the marketplace. 
John Heinbockel: And then just lastly, maybe just talk to how the Walgreen partnership is ramping up on the procurement side. And does that become a much bigger driver of part of that $1 billion later this year and even bigger next year? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. It's -- yes, that's a good call. Actually, that would be very true in the way you characterized it. So we've really just then got off the ground with that part of the partnership. As you know, the retail test that we have in market have now been going for some time, and we've been pleased with the progress there. And we continue to develop our thinking around how to connect more detail with the customer and fulfill on that convenient shopping experience. The group purchasing organization part of it is very much in its infancy stage. We've just started to work on where the opportunities are there, and that would certainly be part of the tailwinds into 2020 and beyond in driving more efficiency and cost savings. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, John. As always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how we live our purpose every day. 
 To our associates, thank you for everything that you do for our customers, communities and each other every single day, every single hour of every day. You truly make a difference. This difference makes people's lives better, and this was obviously incredibly evident earlier this week when the devastating tornado touched down in Nashville. I'm always amazed and proud to hear stories of our associates pulling together in the aftermath of events like this. One story that was shared with me is some customers that didn't have protection came to our store to seek shelter inside of our dairy case when the tornado hit, and that's just one example. And the thing that's even, to me, more impressive is what our associates do, what you do when your own families are personally impacted and to all the work that you do to ensure our stores are open and serving our communities. As I mentioned earlier on the call in regard to the threat of the coronavirus, always being there for our communities is part of our heritage. This is Kroger at our best, when we come together and uplift our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for what you do for everyone every day, and thank you for joining our call today. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2019-12-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks for this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.
 I would like to thank those of you who were able to attend our investor conference last month where we shared our progress on Restock Kroger. We believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders. It provides us with a clear purpose and our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. It focuses us on redefining the customer experience, identifying the partners who will help us deliver customer value today and in the future and putting the right talent and teams in place to focus on growth in our supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses.
 We are proud of the progress we have made, and we've learned from the challenges we've experienced. We are on track with a stable and growing supermarket business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued investment in seamless. We are growing our supermarket business by focusing on 3 levers to drive identical sales: fresh, power brands and data and personalization. And we continue to build a seamless ecosystem that is available, relevant and accessible for our customers. All of this combined to generate positive results in the third quarter.
 We continued to grow identical sales, reduce costs and deliver strong free cash flow. We had a broad-based identical sales improvement. 15 of our divisions had increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the second quarter. We delivered a slightly improved FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Headwinds in pharmacy were offset by strong fuel performance during the quarter. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.
 Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem for our customers. We know our customers value greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an essential component of growing overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth as well and share of wallet. So seamless is a both, not an either/or.
 Our data clearly shows that over time and after initial investments, the profitability of a digital customer is the same as an in-store customer. We continue to see an improving operating profit trend in digital, and therefore, our investments are maturing as expected and consistent with the graph we shared at Investor Day.
 Our digital sales grew 21% in the third quarter. As we shared previously, we expect our digital sales growth to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer. We have expanded our digital coverage to reach 96% of our customers. This means that 96% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.
 We continue to invest in digital platforms as this is where the customers are increasingly going to meet many of their needs. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion.
 We continue the rollout of Ocado facilities. In November, Kroger announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Wisconsin. The automated warehouse will serve customers in Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana. What's so exciting about Ocado is their model to deliver to the customer is significantly less costly than our existing model and any of the other models we've examined as well. Not only will these facilities accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. One of the comments we made at IR Day is that Ocado keeps learning and improving their model. Ocado's recent announcement of a micro fulfillment center in Bristol is a good example of this.
 We believe that the food industry is special. It is huge, a $1.5 trillion market. And not only do people need to eat, they love to eat. Food isn't a commodity, but it's the center of our lives. Customers deserve a partner like Kroger who can provide inspiration and fulfill their passion for food. And unlike our national competitors, Kroger is food first. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy fresh food that tastes amazing.
 As we shared in November, fresh is an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Our product standards, selection criteria and supply chain are core strengths and are built to deliver first-to-market and best-of-season fresh products across the United States.
 Our produce department led the way in sales for the quarter, demonstrating how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. In addition, we launched our Fresh for Everyone brand transformation campaign, and the initial feedback from both our customers and our associates is very positive.
 One of the many ways we demonstrate our passion for food is through Kroger's best-in-class Our Brands portfolio. While many grocers offer private label products, Our Brands is a real differentiator for Kroger because our customers tell us through blind taste tests that Our Brands' quality is better than not only the competitors' private label products but also many leading national brands as well. Kroger's Our Brands grew 3.4% this quarter. We also introduced 231 new Our Brand items during the third quarter.
 Kroger's third differentiating lever to drive identical sales growth is personalization. Data is a differentiator for Kroger. Many retailers have transactional data, but none have the customer data and the insights to make meaningful suggestions to their customers like Kroger. We continue to see incredible effectiveness and efficiency from a focus on loyal customers and investing in their satisfaction.
 One specific area I'd like to highlight is our strong fuel points program. As we shared at the Investor Day conference last month, an amazing 83% of our loyal customers engage with our fuel rewards program each year. We are increasingly targeting promotion and personalization of fuel rewards, and fuel drove trips and sales in the third quarter.
 We are using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, which adds up to a business built for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns.
 Kroger continues to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.5 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase its dividend to create value for shareholders. We are confident that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future because of our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth.
 Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders both today and the future.
 And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Rodney and thank those of you who were able to attend or view the Investor Day webcast last month. As we shared in New York, our model for a strong and durable retail supermarket business begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. We believe that our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers is driving increased identical sales across our store and digital ecosystem.
 To drive sustainable sales growth for the long term, we will continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to the customer. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience, with an even greater emphasis on fresh, Our Brands and personalization. We are demonstrating through the first 3 quarters of the year we are being very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business.
 Our supermarket business and the traffic and data this generates serves as the foundation from which we are able to drive higher growth in our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses that we continue to expect to accelerate our results. We expect our model to deliver improved operating results over time and continued strong free cash flow, and we expect this to translate into a consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return through EPS growth driven by sustained net earnings growth and the return of cash to shareholders via share repurchase, plus a growing dividend over time.
 Now I'd like to share third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.47 per diluted share. As noted in this morning's press release, that includes a $0.03 out-of-period charge that I will share more detail on in a moment. But first, I'll highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly robust.
 Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the third quarter, and our fuel performance mitigated retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds in the quarter.
 LIFO charge for the quarter was $23 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. We now estimate LIFO for the year to be approximately $90 million versus our original expectation of $50 million.
 Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than the same period last year due to a decrease in the benefits of federal tax credits and an increase in reserves.
 I'll now provide additional detail about 2 specific items that affected our results in the third quarter. First, the out-of-period charge of $29 million that I referenced earlier. This charge is related to a provision in a single pharmacy contract that should have been recognized over the previous 6 quarters. Given the complexity of the contract and the introduction of new clawback provisions, a part of the contract was misinterpreted. The required correction was identified in our standard management review process. This charge is not material to total company results, and the financial effect in each of the prior individual quarters was immaterial to net earnings per diluted share. However, the cumulative effect on our performance in the third quarter reduced adjusted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03 and gross margin by 9 basis points. We, therefore, felt it was important to provide a greater level of insight into this item. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2019 or 2020 as a result of this contract going forward.
 I'd now like to talk about Lucky's Market. During our investor conference last month, we committed to continue to be disciplined in prioritizing capital allocation to improve return on invested capital and create sustainable shareholder return. As part of a portfolio review, we made the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives in relation to our investment in Lucky's Market. As a result of this review, the company has decided to divest its interest in Lucky's Market and recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter. Accounting rules require Kroger to record the gross amount in operating profit. However, the real economic interest to Kroger is a pretax charge of $131 million. Additional details are provided in the financial tables of our press release.
 The impairment charge is a noncash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of this decision.
 Turning now to some of the highlights in the third quarter as underlying trends were very robust. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.5% during the third quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched Restock program. Several supermarket departments outperformed the company, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. Digital contributed approximately 70 basis points to identical sales, with Kroger pickup and delivery continuing to show strong momentum.
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $653 million compared to $664 million in the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the third quarter.
 FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business.
 Gross margin rate, excluding fuel and pharmacy, improved slightly in the quarter as cost of goods savings and growth in alternative businesses offset continued retail price investments.
 While profitability in retail pharmacy is lower than we had budgeted this year, it remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns. We were pleased to see the decline in gross margin rate compared to last year was lower in the third quarter than the first 2 quarters of 2019, and this trend is expected to continue in quarter 4.
 As a result of continued growth in pharmacy sales, improved product sourcing and initiatives that lower the cost of fill trips, our expectation is that pharmacy profitability will be less of a headwind in 2020.
 Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the third quarter compared to last year. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.
 OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points. This was achieved through broad-based improvement of Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives.
 We remain on track to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings achieved last year. We also have clear line of sight to the $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020 that we shared at our investor conference. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies.
 Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change. As part of the company's ongoing evolution, store operating divisions recently evaluated and reduced middle management roles to ensure they have the right talent in the right roles closest to our customers in store leadership positions. As a result, Kroger incurred severance charges in the third quarter totaling $80 million.
 Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discount at the pump. As Rodney mentioned, fuel is driving lower customer trips and sales, and the amount of fuel rewards paid to loyal customers increased by 8% in the third quarter.
 The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 this quarter versus $2.81 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the third quarter.
 Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continue to be the primary drivers of growth this year.
 Kroger Precision Marketing continues to build momentum, increasing engagement to over 1,000 brands with a 90% retention rate and significantly higher spend. We have relationships with all major agency holding companies supporting their media activations as they deploy brand-building programs. Our Media business continues to release new inventory and create new publisher relationships to support the demand of advertisers.
 And now to update on labor relations. As we have previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's investments in our associates, we are improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development.
 We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Southern California, Portland, Seattle and Michigan during the quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Memphis. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant today to associates. 
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 A key element of our capital allocation strategy is to use our free cash flow to invest in the business and drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.
 We committed to prioritize free cash flow in 2019 to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.5 billion, and Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.5 for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2.72 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range.
 Now that we are operating within our target range, and as we expect to generate strong free cash flow, we anticipate starting to buy back shares in the fourth quarter under our $1 billion Board authorization. This is not expected to have a material impact on fourth quarter EPS.
 Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019.
 We expect underlying identical sales growth in the fourth quarter will be similar to third quarter. However, incremental SNAP dollars that were in the market in January 2019 represent about a 50% -- 50 basis point -- excuse me, 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. We, therefore, anticipated reported ID sales will be towards the lower end of our 2019 guidance range for quarter 4 as we cycle the effect of SNAP.
 We continue to expect the fourth quarter to deliver double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Where we land with our adjusted EPS annual guidance range will be heavily influenced by fuel margins in the fourth quarter, which were at record highs in quarter 4 last year. Our customers' shopping behaviors affected by the lower SNAP dollars in market in January will also influence the outcome.
 As you know, we typically share annual guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in March. But this year, we provided guidance for 2020 several months early. We remain confident in the 2020 guidance that we shared last month at our Investor Day in New York.
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As I shared when we first began the call, we believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. We are on track with a stable and growing grocery business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued development of our seamless ecosystem. Our focus on the fundamentals generated positive results in our supermarket business in the third quarter, which gives us strong momentum heading into the holiday season.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: I just wanted to start with a question on the Q4 outlook. So you have a fairly wide range. That, I guess, implies earnings growth anywhere from sort of like mid-singles all the way up over 20%. One question, I think, that I have related to this is what are the puts and takes around that range? And I know you mentioned fuel, but a second question related to that is that to get to these numbers sort of either way, you need core grocery earnings to improve, and that's despite what is a harder comparison on SNAP and quite frankly recent pressure in grocery. So can you just kind of walk us through those puts and takes and then what you think will drive core grocery earnings to inflect positively in Q4? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll cover that. So you're correct, we expect -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are expecting adjusted EPS growth to be in the double digits in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned a moment ago, we're assuming and expecting identical sales growth to be in the range in the quarter, continuing the sort of trend that we saw in Q3, but there will be some SNAP headwinds that will bring it down towards the lower end of the range. So that's the kind of core assumption around ID sales for the quarter.
 We do cycle some investments. In Q4 last year, if you recall that we set up costs around some facilities in D.C. So from a gross margin perspective, we do have some tailwinds that will help the quarter. We also expect to continue to see the cost-saving improvements that we've been accelerating throughout the year as we continue to execute on the $1 billion cost-saving plan. And of course, I think we shared on previous quarters that alternative profit streams tends to be skewed more towards the fourth quarter, predominantly because both KPS has a heavy fourth quarter influence on the results and then Media continues to accelerate, and Q4 is always a higher Media quarter as well. So you combine an accelerating rate and the fact that Media is higher in the fourth quarter helps the alternative profit part of the business to continue to grow.
 In terms of the sort of puts and takes in the quarter that could influence where we finish in the range, on the headwind side, obviously, we have been investing in a new brand launch, and we're obviously spending dollars there in continuing to improve the messaging and translating that into a connection with our customers. We also launched the promotion on free pickup for the quarter as well and seeing how that plays out in terms of customer behavior. And then, of course, we also have the fuel headwind in the fourth quarter where our rate was $0.34, which was a record high last year. So those would be the headwinds that we're pushing against versus the assumptions I mentioned earlier.
 The unknowns around the range, really, with fuel being a record high in the fourth quarter last year, if fuel performs in line with where it's been on average for the year-to-date position, it would obviously be at a certain level. If it was -- which is a $0.29 to $0.30 range, if it was at the similar level as last year at $0.34, that makes a meaningful difference to how the quarter ends. And then, of course, seeing how customers behave as a result of the SNAP dollars not being in market in January is a further factor in really causing us to leave the range as wide as it is. But we do feel confident in the way we see the model in the fourth quarter, which is why we still believe double-digit growth in the earnings per share is what we'd expect to achieve. 
Edward Kelly: And just a follow-up. It seems like what's new in terms of what we're learning in the guidance this quarter is it -- I guess it seems like there's a $0.03 pharmacy charge that's in the guidance given that it's in your $0.47. Your LIFO charge is going up by $0.04. So that seems to be something that's a bit more unexpected. What's offsetting that to allow you to maintain guidance? 
W. McMullen: Ed, this is Rodney. Just a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in. Obviously, our identicals continue to improve and strong there. If you look at gross margin without fuel and pharmacy, a slight improvement there. We had great balance between cost improvements and gross investment and it's the continuation of those pieces coming together. So it's really -- the core business continuing to improve and move in the right direction, that's providing the tailwind to offset the $0.03 on the pharmacy that was out-of-a-quarter adjustment and the LIFO as well. I don't know, Gary, anything? 
Gary Millerchip: I would completely agree with you, Rodney. I think the key thing for us is that, to your point, that those headwinds, even with those headwinds, if you strip those back in the quarter and look at Q3, underlying EPS and operating profit would have been positive excluding the out-of-period adjustment, as Rodney mentioned. Obviously, ID sales was very positive during the quarter. But we mentioned on the call, we didn't include it in the press release, but the impact of the out-of-period on gross margin rate was 9 basis points. So actually, in the quarter, gross margin rate, even with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out, would have been balanced with OG&A improvements over 15. So we were 24 basis points reported gross margin decline, excluding fuel. Taking out those 9 basis points, you get to the 15 basis points of underlying, if you like, gross margin investment after the -- excluding the onetime -- sorry, the out-of-period adjustment.
 So when we look at 15 basis points of investment, including pharmacy headwinds that we faced and we achieved 15 basis points of OG&A improvement, we actually feel like the progress that we're seeing in the model has been masked quite a bit in the quarter and we feel very positive about the underlying trends that we're seeing in the business. 
Operator: The next question is from Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Maybe first, just following up on fuel. Can you help us with the benefit you're getting from improved sourcing and the sustainability of that relative to just kind of a general step higher in industry profitability and how that's playing out? 
W. McMullen: It's a combination of really some technology investments that we've made in terms of how to buy fuel and making sure, from a market standpoint, how we're pricing on a daily basis and reacting to what our competitors are doing. So it's the benefit of the way fuel is being bought plus being much more disciplined relative to the market. So it's really the combination of those.
 In terms of expectations going forward, from a procurement standpoint, we don't believe that's something that will continue to incrementally get better. We do believe it's something that we'll be able to maintain, and it's something that we've reflected in our guidance going forward. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the Lucky's write-down. I don't think it was that long ago that you guys were citing double-digit IDs at Lucky's and great trends in produce. Maybe just a little bit more on the decision to exit the investment, the write-down of the investment. And is there any commentary on that kind of subchannel of food retail, kind of the specialized fresh-led food retailers and smaller boxes that's causing you to say maybe the traditional larger store fresh-led format is the way to go? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it really gets back to Gary's comments in the prepared remarks is -- and we talked about at Investor Day, it's really reviewing our whole portfolio of things that we are involved with and working on. And it really -- the amount of investment that it would take for Lucky's to be a meaningful contributor to Kroger overall and the efforts that it would take, we just didn't think it created a good return for the investments that were needed to be made relative to that. So it was really driven by narrowing our focus and the additional requirements to make it something that would be meaningful to Kroger. I don't know, Gary, you've been more on a day-to-day basis involved, anything you want to add? 
Gary Millerchip: I don't -- I think you characterized it well, Rodney. I think the only thing maybe to build in the second part of the question, I -- we do believe that as we get better connecting on fresh and continue to evolve the strategy around natural and organic, obviously, we're providing a far more comprehensive level of experience for that customer than ever before and continue to do more of that as we continue to build out the strategy around freshness and connecting with our loyal customers.
 We do believe that there's still a role for the small format store. I think it's certainly proven. And I think it's still probably to be proven in the industry about what is the right model for a smaller format store and how do you make that economic model work and how do you connect with the customer in a way that drives the right value on those smaller shopping trips as well. So we still believe and continue to look for opportunities. And obviously, our Walgreens pilot continues to provide an opportunity to learn how to continue to build a strategy that has a small format presence in there. But I do think it also demonstrates your comment that it's hard to figure out that small format model and to make it work effectively. 
Operator: The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Been looking at the Thanksgiving sales and how customers were spending, trading up. Can you talk about what that might mean for the Christmas selling season later this month? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at quarter-to-date, our identicals would be pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. The balancing of it is significantly different than the last few years because, obviously, there's 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you look at the way how customers spend their money, we continue to see obviously strong on people trading up, strong performance in wine, cheese, all those types of categories, and we would certainly expect that to continue to stay consistent through Christmas as well. So we really expect the business to continue where it is through Christmas. Obviously, if you look at January of next year, it's really the SNAP cycling, the SNAP impact would affect the kind of the numbers that we've provided for guidance. 
Charles Cerankosky: Related to customers trading up, is that what you're trying to do when you invest in the customer experience? Prepared food strikes me you're making investments there. But are there other things we should think about? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It's fascinating because the customer is trading up both in terms of buying bigger package size. So what we find is when people are tied on budgets, they go to smaller package size. So we see people trading up there. We see people trading up to products that's better for you, natural and organic category. Prepared foods would be an area that we see people continuing to trade up for, and it's an area where we've focused a lot of attention on how do we get better. We view it as a huge opportunity to improve from where we are. And it's one of those things where we're just at the beginning part of that journey but certainly see customers very willing to pick up dinner at Kroger but do it with a Home Chef meal or something already prepared. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. 
Antonio Tabet: This is Antonio Tabet taking over for Mike Montani. I just wanted to ask something on the 4Q comp outlook. You guys are obviously cycling SNAP in January. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing so far now with the whole rebrand going on.
 And another follow-up to that is with the option of free pickup promotion going on right now until January 1, is there a possibility that, that stays? Or what are you seeing from that so far from the reception of customers? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the outlook for the fourth quarter, so far in the quarter, we're tracking pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. So it's really up until the SNAP period, we really don't see changes there.
 In terms of the pickup, free pickup option, we really aren't to a point yet of deciding whether to continue it or not. As you know, we've done it in several markets, and we're still early in the analysis. We -- the customer adoption has been stronger -- a little bit stronger than what we were expecting. But it's -- we're still at a point where we don't need to decide that yet in terms of whether we extend it or not. 
Gary Millerchip: Just to add, Rodney, so it is literally a few weeks obviously into -- since we announced the promotion. It's interesting. We're seeing a combination of new customers starting to use the service as well as existing loyal Kroger shoppers using the service more frequently as well. So we'll be using all of that data, as you might expect, to really analyze and evaluate. And that's certainly a factor that could also influence how the quarter plays out in terms of sales, which is another reason why we're trying to be clear about sharing the different moving parts that could still affect the quarter. 
Antonio Tabet: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the digital side. You guys grew digital sales 21% this quarter. And just the way we're thinking about it, for the full year, we're thinking somewhere in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion digital sales versus 2018 value somewhere around the baseline of $4 billion. So that implies around 31%, 30% year-over-year growth. Is that somewhat reasonable to think of? Or is that an attainable target? Just want to get your color on that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at it on a run rate basis, the numbers that you shared would be very consistent with what we see. The other thing I always think is important to remember that I mentioned on our digital business and Yael shared it on a graph is the profitability of that business is maturing as we expect. And if you look at the early adopters on digital, the profitability of that customer was the same as going in store because we get such a higher share of their total spend. And we continue to see that maturity happen as well, which, for us, is something that makes it a sustainable model longer term as well. 
Gary Millerchip: Just one thing to add, Rodney, you said in your prepared comments and I mentioned it briefly as well, but I think we shared before that it really is the cycling of the Home Chef merger that caused the absolute percentage growth rate to show a declining trend. The underlying progress that we're seeing in customer engagement through Kroger pickup and delivery continues to be very strong and very consistent in the underlying results that we're seeing beyond the headline number. 
Antonio Tabet: Okay. And does that headwind continue to 4Q? 
Gary Millerchip: We've cycled that now. So it kind of -- it was partly through Q3, so you have kind of roughly half of it in the -- sorry, partly through Q2, so roughly half of it in the second quarter, and now it's fully cycled through in Q3. I think Yael may have shared, too, at the investor conference that we expect the growth year-over-year going into 2020 to be in that 20% range, consistent with what we shared this quarter. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Rodney, thank you for the update on the quarter-to-date comp. Can you -- I know you probably will say no, you've never done this before. But just given some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, could you give us an update on sort of where you stand on your core gross margin quarter-to-date and your fuel margin as well? The reason I'm asking is there does seem to be a little bit of hesitation from some investors on your ability to sort of hit the high end of your guidance range for the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I really would just go back to the comments that Gary made before. If you look at the underlying supermarket business, it continues to be strong. Identicals continue to be strong. A very good balance between cost reductions and investments in service and growth. The biggest swing would be the fuel margin. And even internally, the swings can be so much from day-to-day that it's really -- the value of where we are quarter-to-date, I don't think it can change overnight. And I remember the other day being in a market where in the morning, the margins were $0.40. In the afternoon, the margins were $0.15. It's that type of swing. But when you look at overall, it's a great return and it creates a lot of customer loyalty.
 So -- and then the other piece is SNAP. So I don't know, Gary, if there's any additional insight. But to me, quarter-to-date, fuel margins are just kind of hard because it swings so much. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes, I think that's right. And just to put the number into context, I mentioned it briefly earlier, but the rate that we've been trending at year-to-date in that $0.29-ish range, $0.34 was the Q4 rate last year. That $0.05 range can make a $50 million difference in terms of profitability. So -- and obviously, we have a very clear strategy of how we connect with customers on fuel and making sure that we're in line with the market. And so it is one of those areas where it can have a significant impact, and hence why I appreciate it does leave a much wider range than we normally want to, I think, have in place for the fourth quarter, and it's certainly not a lack of confidence in what we're seeing in the underlying core business, but it's just -- with that level of uncertainty out there on something like rates, it's -- we felt it was prudent to leave the range where it is. 
Kenneth Goldman: I get that. And then my follow-up is, obviously, the government made some changes that are going to take some people in the America off food stamps, and it sounds like there's more of that coming. I'm curious, to what degree does your 2020 guidance factor that as a risk? Because, clearly, I think that if 700,000 or eventually some of the people think it will be closer to 3 million Americans get off food stamps, I can't say that as a positive for you, but I'm curious if there's any way to think about numerically how that might affect you? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. Ken, obviously, it's something that we continue to watch very closely. And obviously, it's one of those things that we knew was a potential risk that's out there in the business, and we'll continue to watch it and evaluate. From our perspective, we really try and build the business model around being able to adapt to the circumstances, and we do believe that the model that we're creating and our ability to connect with customers and deliver an overall experience, the personalized pricing offers that we can generate that obviously are -- what we tend to see when customers have less dollars, they'll tend to gravitate more to own brand products, and you'll start to see some behavior shift. But because food is a nondiscretionary spend, usually, the customer is going to make adaptations that they have to, to be able to still buy the groceries that feed the family.
 So from our perspective, it's certainly something that we contemplate as a risk as we think through how we'll continue to build our model and drive connection with customers. And it's something that we'll continue to adapt as we hear more and learn when and if the changes occur. But obviously, it's one of those things out of our control. And our focus is much more on how do we make sure we win the customer and continue to adapt strategy if some of those things were to hit us as a headwind in 2020. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additions. Obviously, the overall economy continues to be strong as well, which provides support. And when you look at SNAP, we would be less dependent on SNAP than many of our competitors would be as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Firstly, just wanted to touch on price investments. I think last quarter, you called out, I think it was about 12 basis points of price investment. Just curious if there was a similar level of price investments this quarter. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I don't think we've typically called out specifically price investments. What I would say in terms of maybe a couple of thoughts, when you think about gross margin and what happened in gross margin during the quarter, the way that -- to sort of break it down, if you like, and I covered a couple of these points earlier, but if you exclude fuel from the results, we had a 24 basis point investment in gross margin, 9 basis points of that related to the out-of-period charge that we shared in the press release this morning, which essentially brings it down to 15 basis points. All of that gross margin headwind was essentially in the health and wellness space between Kroger specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. And as Rodney mentioned, our gross margin rate overall improved slightly when you exclude pharmacy from the core business.
 So another way to say that is through the cost of goods savings that we were able to execute on during the quarter and the alternative profit growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter, which both support improvements in gross margin, we fully offset the continued price investments that we made in the business to drive the continued improvement in ID sales growth.
 We are continuing to invest in price. As we've shared, I think, at the Investor Day, a lot of our focus this year is on really making sure that we're using our data to drive the price investments in areas that matter most to our customers. And some of those are going to be personalized offers and promotions, but some of it will also be in fuel rewards. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that while the profitability of fuel improved during the quarter, that was offsetting the supermarket business by an 8% growth in the amount of fuel rewards that we paid to customers to incentivize them to continue buying Kroger.
 So it's a complex model in that sense, but we are continuing to invest in price. We're pleased with the way that customers are reacting to the investments that we're making because it's certainly allowing us as that one component of driving the identical sales growth that we shared in the quarter. But we're being very deliberate in balancing those investments with cost of goods savings and alternative profit growth. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing that helped gross -- our shrink improved for the ninth consecutive quarter and warehousing and transportation costs improved as well. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. That's helpful. And then you briefly mentioned the prepared food opportunity. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about your vision behind the recently announced ClusterTruck partnership? And does this at all impact how you're thinking about Home Chef? 
W. McMullen: I'll start with the end of your question first. It doesn't affect us how we look at Home Chef at all. And if you think about our overall strategy on trying to serve the customer anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want, as you know, about half of food is food already prepared where people spend their money. And our market share there is significantly less than on the traditional supermarket business. And we really view that it will be a combination of Home Chef, something physical in stores in terms of meals ready to heat, ready to eat. And ClusterTruck is one of those where we think it's an addition to that overall ecosystem. Obviously, they have incredibly good technology. It's made to order quickly. And they will be able to leverage -- and we're doing -- it's obviously on a test basis, they'll be able to leverage some of our physical assets to be able to scale as well.
 So it's really an additional piece in terms of how do we get the customers what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. And it's just an overall part of the overall ecosystem. And we just see the opportunity on food that's already prepared is a massive opportunity. 
Operator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: So you said you've been encouraged by some of the early learnings from your expansion of the free digital pickup initiative. Can you give us a sense for how that initiative has impacted the P&L? So is the financial performance in line with what you expected? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks for the question. Just recall, again, it is really early days in the journey with the promotion because we literally launched it a few weeks ago. And obviously, part of the modeling that you would expect us to do as we understand customer behavior is to look at -- as Kroger does on everything that we do, look at the longitudinal behavior with the customer and not just the individual transaction but how does that change the level of engagement with the customer, and that's going to need to happen over a longer period of time, as Rodney mentioned earlier.
 Certainly, the early encouraging signs are, as I mentioned, we're starting to see new customers experience the service and start to engage in Kroger pickup that haven't before. We're also seeing existing Kroger pickup customers start to increase the frequency with which they use pickup service. And so a lot of the financial modeling that we will do will really be looking at those metrics over a longer period of time and saying, how does that play out in terms of the value it creates and how does it drive loyalty. And then, of course, as we talked a little bit about at the investor conference, we'll look at that in the context of the investments that we're making in the business and how does customer value this part of the experience versus other ways in which we're creating value across price investments, across fuel discounts and obviously through the experience that we're offering in the store.
 So it's a pretty complex area. And certainly, we'll look at it over a longer period of time. We're seeing kind of the type of behavior we have expected to see, and it's certainly been positive. But it's really going to be a longer period of time before we could really evaluate the way in which it impacts the model with the customer. 
Michael Lasser: And just to clarify, Gary, you have assumed that in your 2020 guidance that you've provided, the test will be limited to 2019 so it will not continue into 2020 at this point. And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Gary Millerchip: We haven't really gotten into specifics around what our pricing strategy will be in 2020. As we talked about, obviously, I would think about it more much as you think back to the chart that I shared at the investor meeting in New York and how we're balancing the investments that we're making in the cost savings in the business. So we certainly have a clear view of how much we believe we want to invest in the business next year and how that will be supported by the $1 billion of cost savings that we're expecting. So if we were going to see the value in pickup driving more value in our model, it would be because either we expect it to drive higher sales and support the investment or we believe it would be a better way to invest the dollars that we think are important to driving value for the customer in 2020. 
Michael Lasser: That's helpful. My follow-up question is, Rodney, you've seen some pretty good momentum in your ID sales. There's probably a variety of factors that are contributing to that, including a healthier overall environment, being further away from some of the disruptive changes that you've made and better execution in the business. If you had to rank those factors and maybe any others in order of importance and magnitude that they've contributed to driving this improvement, how would you do that? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- great question, Michael. We would really view those as pretty equal. The other thing that we would add on top of that is really using personalization and data to be more specific for each customer individually. So like on -- the example I gave on fuel rewards, but it would be true for offers more than just fuel rewards, but really personalizing it to each household individually. And it's really all of those -- we would call it, the sum of all parts. It's all of that together that's creating and improving the momentum. It's not just one single thing. 
Operator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. 
Joshua Kamboj: This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon. So sales trends are improving and the grocery gross margin increased slightly in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that combination is in the near term? And then more broadly, what changes in the competitive landscape would you need to see to undergo a deeper round of price investments over the next 3 years than what's currently embedded in your plan? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part of the question, I would kind of draw back again to what we talked about at the investor conference. The way we think about the model going forward is, certainly, we're going to continue to invest in price. We're going to continue to invest in the customer experience because the long-term sustainable growth in loyalty, we think that's critical to our plan. What we're doing very deliberately is being very disciplined in how we're managing costs within the business, both cost of goods savings but also OG&A cost efficiency, which obviously was strong during the quarter. And then alternative profit streams continues to accelerate and obviously offset the gross margin investments that we're making as well.
 So I think we look at it much more of an overall ecosystem, if you like, is how do we use food as the foundation for customer loyalty, which drives the traffic. And then fuel obviously builds on that in terms of causing customers to shop more frequently. And then you think about the health and wellness business and alternative profit streams layering on together to create this overall ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and drives total profitability of the customer. And the way we think about it is how do we pull those levers together in a way that allows us to continue to invest and build loyalty. And we're using the different dynamics there around alternative profit and cost savings to be able to continue to invest.
 I think when we look at the market, certainly, obviously, there's always high competition. We expect that to continue. We always assume that within our model. And we feel very good about the plans that we're implementing around driving costs out and continue to grow alternative profit that we can make the investments that we need to, to be able to continue to grow customer loyalty. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'd only add a couple of things. One, and Gary briefly mentioned it, if you look at continuing to learn to improve the customer experience, that provides support and ongoing support because we still -- we've made good progress, but we still see opportunities to get better.
 The one area that I've been pleasantly surprised, as you know, we've been able to -- in 2018, we were able to take over $1 billion of costs out. We're on track to exceed that again incrementally in 2019, and we have plans to do that in 2020 as well. We continue to see good opportunity to take costs out. And when you look at all those -- both those pieces together and the free cash flow of the business is what gives us confidence and comfort in the comment that Gary shared at the investor meeting of TSR of 8% to 11% per year. 
Joshua Kamboj: That's helpful. And then in general, maybe you could just quickly touch on your price gaps versus some of your key competitors. Have they been widening or narrowing? And are you pretty happy with where they sit at the moment? 
W. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that we always think it's important, we're comfortable where we are, but it's always important to remember that customers decide where to shop based on freshness of departments, and we shared with you that our customer feedback on fresh is better than our big box competitors. We also have tons of personalized offers where a customer gets value, both in terms of individual mailings, individual e-mails and fuel. So it's all of those pieces together, and we feel good about where we -- our gap is. 
Operator: And the last question will be from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. 
Robert Ohmes: Just 2 follow-ups. Just the first on the LIFO increase, can you maybe just -- you mentioned procuring better, but LIFO is coming in higher than expected. I think in the press release, you guys called out grocery and dairy inflation. Is this all commodity driven? Or are CPG companies pushing through price increases? And then also, could you tell us what the inflation component of IDs was to the third quarter? So maybe just paint us a picture of what exactly is going on between all those things. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes, it's an interesting question around LIFO and inflation because -- I'll maybe answer the 2 questions slightly differently. From an inflation point of view, as you know, we've shared before, we were assuming inflation in the range of 0% to 1% in the year. I would say it's trending slightly above that range. Actually, for Q3, I wouldn't say it's materially different than it was in Q2. There are a couple of categories like produce went slightly down and meat went slightly up, but nothing that would have been dramatic in terms of the overall change in inflation. So just slightly ahead of that 1% assumption that we had during the year. And actually, even though our LIFO charge forecasted increasing, we haven't really seen a dramatic change in the overall inflation rate across the categories. Everything I just said now I should probably caveat excludes fuel and pharmacy because those 2 obviously tend to have a different trajectory versus most of the food categories.
 Interesting -- with LIFO, it is a one data point in time at the end of the year that we follow to support the accounting rules that are in place around making that LIFO adjustment. With the data point that we used in the third quarter caused us to, in following that process, believe that we should increase the rate and based on what it's telling us, that's why we called out the forecast is expected to be a headwind for the year. Of course, it's a noncash item, and it doesn't really impact the underlying performance of the business. But it will impact the earnings for the year based on the trend that we're seeing right now. But I wouldn't say it's a reflection of a major change in what we're seeing in inflation.
 And obviously, we've shared before, when we see price increases, generally speaking, we'll be pushing back on them based on our knowledge of our own brand products and managing those. But where we are seeing them, we're generally looking to pass them on to the customer where it makes sense in those markets. 
Robert Ohmes: And just my other follow-up question. Just on fuel rewards, so you're expecting the CPG profitability of fuel kind of -- it sounds like flatten out next year. But it sounds like you're also going to be pushing harder, if I understood it, to kind of drive IDs more using the fuel rewards program. Just how should we think about that? And has there been a change in the responsiveness to fuel rewards that's got you interested in pulling that lever a little harder to drive IDs and penetrate loyalty more? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It really is an important part of our overall connection rewards on -- back to our customers for them shopping with us. I would say part of it is just continuing to learn new approaches that connect with the customer. So over the last, really, 6 to 12 months, we've been doing a lot of different types of tests and learns, trying to identify additional approaches that connect well with the customer. And it's really some of those are working, so we continue to scale that. How much we scale will really be driven by the degree of customer connection and how much does it drive the business. But customers still love an incredible great value for fuel. And we have so many convenient fuel locations. It really works out well for our customers and for our business as well. 
Robert Ohmes: And just, Rodney, how should we think about -- if you do keep growing it at 8% year-over-year, how will you fund that in 2020 if you're not going to be growing the profitability of your fuel business at the same rate? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Well, when we talk about fuel cents per gallon, we do not reduce that for any rewards at all. That doesn't show up there in terms of our internal financials. If you look at the overall guidance that we gave for 2020, we would be reflecting what we expect and plan to do on fuel rewards. But it really gets back to Gary's comment in terms of by -- improving identicals by this much, these type of process changes and getting costs out, what type of capacity does that give us to invest in service and price. And we would look at fuel rewards as part of that price investment because that's how our customers look at it.
 Thanks, Robbie. We really appreciate everybody joining us today. And as always, thank you for your questions. Hopefully, you can get the sense from Gary and my comments that our underlying business results continue to be strong. Identicals continue to move in the right direction. We had good balance on investing in growth and cost improvements, and the free cash flow of the business continued to be strong, which positions us to get into a position of being able to buy stock back as well. So when you look at it overall in the quarter, feel very good about the underlying results and where we're headed.
 As you know, before I end today's call, I always like to share a few final comments that's directed at our associates and how we live our purpose every day. Last week, I was visiting with store associates in our Collierville Kroger in Memphis. And a customer approached me when I was walking into the store, and he just wanted to share why he shops at Kroger. And he said -- first of all, I gave an example where one of our associates just gave incredible customer service. And then he said, "Krogers, you always are great at donating food and funds to serve hungry families in our communities." And he specifically talked about his community. And to me, that reminded me of the privilege that we all have, to serve our customers and communities and each other, whether it's generously giving back to our neighbors in need or by being there for our more than 11 million customers that come into our stores and online every day, especially during this busy holiday season.
 We open our doors and welcome everyone in as guests, whether they shop with us all the time or it's their first time shopping with us. Each celebration or tradition is unique, and we can be there for our customers when they need us most. Because we believe no matter who you are, how you like to shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy, fresh food. Each of us, all 460,000 associates, play an incredibly important role in bringing fresh for everyone to life. From stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, thank you for all you do every day and especially during this busy holiday season. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, merry Christmas and a happy new year. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2019-09-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 In addition, please save the date for our 2019 investor conference, which will be held in New York City on November 5. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you can join us.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.
 Kroger is focused on executing the second year of our Restock Kroger plan to generate shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers: redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value.
 We are halfway through the second year of our 3-year plan. We continue making strategic investments to reposition the company for the future while continuing to grow and deliver today. We started this conversation the last 2 quarters by acknowledging we had our work cut out for us. As always, we remain energized by that challenge. While we're always continually driving for improvement, there are several examples in our second quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus of Restock Kroger blueprint is paying off.
 Guided by our customer obsession, Kroger delivered our best identical sales results since the launch of our transformational plan. Our internal customer measures are improving even faster than our identical sales growth. There is always a lag between improving the customer experience and when the customer will reward us. Some other positive trends during the second quarter include FIFO operating margin that was stable in our supermarket business, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 15 of our divisions had increasingly -- increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the first quarter.
 We continue to reduce costs. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.
 We continue to make significant investments to redefine the grocery customer experience. We are building a platform of seamless experiences to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want. We know the seamless experience is essential to the customer experience, both today and tomorrow, which is why we continue to invest heavily in our capabilities in this area.
 Kroger's digital sales grew by a solid 31% in the second quarter. Pickup and delivery sales growth continued to perform in the mid-30% during the quarter. Going forward, we expect our digital sales growth rate to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer of our other digital offerings like Vitacost. Vitacost remains an important part of our business, and our growth in Ship is in part thanks to what we've gained from their platform and talent.
 We've also expanded our digital coverage area to reach 95% of our customers. This means that 95% of our customers who shop Kroger at a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery. Importantly, we are starting to see improving operating profit trends in our digital business. Our digital business is becoming less of a headwind, which is an important inflection point, and we continue to invest in new capabilities to support our transition to seamless. However, I do want to note, this is still a significant investment for the company.
 A great example of partnering for customer value is our continued rollout of Ocado sheds. In July, Kroger and Ocado announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia. What's so exciting about Ocado is that their model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. So not only will sheds accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way.
 We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. Ocado's technology team of over 1,400 software engineers brings a huge depth of talent and a long track record of innovation to growing opportunities in online grocery retail.
 We also announced an expansion of our relationship with Walgreens to a new test area in Knoxville, Tennessee. Starting this fall, 35 Walgreens stores in the area will feature a curated selection of Kroger's popular Our Brands products like Simple Truth, America's largest natural organic brand, along with national brand products.
 Kroger's Our Brand sales grew 3.1% this quarter. Retail and unit share growth led to the highest second quarter share in Our Brands' history. We also introduced 203 new Our Brand items during the second quarter. Our customers' favorite new items near key food and flavor trends we predicted and then shared with our investor community last year at Investor Day. And those new items delivered more than $137 million in incremental sales during the second quarter, further bolstering our supermarket business. We were thrilled to share the news last week that Kroger is leading the way with the widest assortment of plant-based protein among U.S. retailers through our Simple Truth brand.
 We continue to see progress in alternative profit streams with Media and Kroger Personal Finance as the primary growth drivers. Gary will share additional commentary on the progress of our alternative profit streams in his section.
 Now moving to talent development. As we previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's talent development investments, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger by supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investment in wages, training and development.
 Feed Your Future is our industry-leading education assistance program continues to build momentum. Among all the participants, more than 85% are hourly store associates. Since inception of the program last year, we've distributed 3,000 awards totaling $5.1 million in education assistance.
 In addition to continuing to develop talent internally, we continue to recruit talent from the outside, especially in the areas of digital, technology and supermarkets. Increasingly, customers, associates, stakeholders and U.S. investors are choosing who to partner with based on a purpose and values. We were pleased to see the business roundtable's recent announcement, acknowledging that businesses have a responsibility to be a positive influence on society. Kroger has always been focused on being a trusted partner in communities and committed to social purpose.
 In the second quarter, we were proud to publish our 2019 environmental, social and governance report, reflecting our efforts across the company to be environmentally responsible and a positive influence on society. The report detailed progress on Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan as well as our 2020 sustainability goals.
 Other items highlighted in the report included our 9% reduction in food waste generated by retail stores. We achieved a 13% improvement in supermarket food waste diverted from landfills, moving from 27% diversion in 2017 to 40% in 2018. We reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 9.1 million pounds so far, well on our way to achieving our 10 million pound goal by 2020.
 I will now turn it over to Gary for more detail into our quarterly financials. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.44 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas on our business that were particularly robust.
 Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the second quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plans. The alternative profit businesses achieved budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. And our fuel performance was strong, helping mitigate pharmacy gross margin, LIFO and tax headwinds in the quarter. 
 LIFO charge for the quarter was $30 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by a higher-than-expected inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 18% in the same period last year. These 2 factors combined represented a $0.05 per diluted share headwind in the quarter compared to last year.
 As Rodney mentioned, Kroger reported identical sales without fuel at 2.2% during the second quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched our transformation plan. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, produce and natural foods. We were also pleased with top line momentum in our pharmacy business and experienced mid-single-digit increase in script counts. Overall, we are pleased with sales progress in the quarter, and we will continue to work to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $626 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the second quarter in 2018. Gross margin was 21.9% of sales for the second quarter. FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 29 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business. Retail supermarkets, excluding fuel and retail pharmacy, saw 12 basis points of gross margin investment.
 Based on the needs of the business, we are focused on balancing margin investments and capturing cost of goods, sourcing savings and operational efficiencies to offset these investments. As a great example of this focus, our associates have done an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the second quarter compared to last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.
 OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 14 basis points. This was achieved through continued focus on execution of Restock Kroger initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions.
 We always look for opportunities to improve free cash flow and ROIC, important metrics to Kroger shareholders. During the quarter, we accepted a substantial offer to sell an unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time. Kroger used the gain from this transaction as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the UFCW company pension plan, helping stabilize associates' future benefits. The net impact of these transactions to EPS growth was neutral.
 As we have previously shared, fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.71 this quarter compared with $2.85 in the same quarter last year. Retail fuel profit came in above our expectations for the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the second quarter. We now expect fuel to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year than originally anticipated.
 Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance will be the primary drivers of growth this year.
 Kroger Precision Marketing continued to build momentum in the quarter, increasing engagement to over 300 consumer packaged goods companies and experienced a 90% retention rate along with significantly higher spend. Kroger Personal Finance also saw growth in line with expectations during the quarter as we successfully expanded the number of customers and the frequency with which customers utilize these products.
 And now for an update on labor relations. We ratified the new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee, during the second quarter. We also reached a tentative agreement with the UFCW covering 17,000 associates in our Ralphs division in Southern California earlier this week. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland and Seattle. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Our financial strategy is to use our strong free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.3 billion, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.46 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2.59 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range, and as we start to operate consistently within that range, we will explore options for returning additional capital to shareholders. Earlier this year, Kroger increased the dividend by 14%, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases.
 Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. We are pleased with our second quarter progress and are maintaining full year guidance to 2019.
 With pharmacy gross headwinds expected to continue in the second half of 2019 and as we lap a particularly strong OG&A performance in the third quarter of 2019 -- 2018, we now expect EPS to be flat in the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we lap discrete items from prior year and continue to build strong momentum with our alternative profit streams.
 I'll now turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As Rebekah said earlier, our Annual Kroger Investor Day is coming up in New York on November 5.
 As Gary just mentioned, we reconfirmed our 2019 guidance for identical sales, excluding fuel, adjusted EPS and adjusted FIFO operating profit as well as reconfirmed that we are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We want to be clear on today's call that we are not reconfirming the 3-year $400 million in incremental operating profit expectation. In November, we will give detailed 2020 annual guidance. I do want to highlight that we do expect to deliver FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. We have outlined a handful of key goals for our Investor Day and would like to use this opportunity to provide you with a preview.
 At Investor Day, we plan to reinforce our commitment to the overall framework of our Restock Kroger transformation plan, sharing what has worked well and what has not worked well thus far. We intend to do a deep dive into our supermarket business, which underpins the redefining grocery customer experience pillar of Restock Kroger. November 5 is the appropriate forum to be deliberate and to allow the experts on our team to spend the proper amount of time with our financial stakeholders to explain how we are thinking about Kroger's business model and how to measure the shareholder value created by Restock Kroger. Several of our senior executives will give detailed updates on our progress against the key metrics in our supermarket business and our momentum as well as how we think about it going forward. We will reiterate the ongoing successful results behind our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses. We will also talk about the continued strength in free cash flow since the announcement of Restock Kroger, which enabled us to get back to within our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range earlier than expected. In addition, we will share our views on the business as we look further out beyond 2020 where growth is expected to continue.
 I've said it many times before. Transformation is incredibly difficult, and that's the journey we are on with Restock Kroger. As we reflect on this journey, we want to be transparent about what went according to plan and what didn't go as anticipated. Some things are coming to fruition as we expected but just later than we thought such as identical sales momentum. Some things were unanticipated such as the lower gross profit margin in the pharmacy business that the entire industry is experiencing. Things we did expect and that are going even better than we thought include productivity improvements and cost savings.
 Over the course of the 3-year plan and today's retail environment, there are lots of puts and takes. That said, I want to reiterate that Kroger is committed to FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance.
 The Restock Kroger transformation journey sets the company up for long-term growth looking forward. And the benefits we have seen thus far have helped Kroger in our transformation from grocer to growth company. We have the right overall strategy and framework for this business and look forward to telling you more about it in November.
 Now Gary and I will take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Congrats on a good quarter. So first, I guess on the comp acceleration, I was curious if you can give some more color in terms of whether you saw improvement in traffic or ticket. And also, what do you believe contributed to the comp acceleration during the quarter? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the call, in the prepared remarks, it was broad-based across most divisions. The area that we saw the biggest year-on-year improvement is average spend per item. Customers continue to go upscale and buy bigger product sizes. We also saw continued improvement in loyal households in terms of the numbers and the frequency of their visits. The other pieces to me that I was especially proud of our team is it's broad-based and it's really using our data to connect with customers one on one. 
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, maybe if I could just add a couple of things. I think what we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned in prepared comments too, is many of the elements that we shared in the early part of the year around the accelerators that we expected to help improve the trend in ID sales as we headed through the year have certainly started to show through in the metrics that we look at. So as you'll recall, we talked about as we start to lap the heavier price investments from last year and the space optimization changes that we made in -- predominantly in Q2 and early Q3 last year, as Rodney mentioned, is we're seeing the customer metrics that we look at internally and continue to execute better on starting to show through a trend and improving sales performance.
 And while we -- as we shared on the call and in the press release, the absolute digital sales growth was a lower rate. That was really an adjustment for the Home Chef purchase a year ago. And when you look at ClickList and home delivery, they are still performing very consistently and driving significant growth. And I think we see all those components continuing to build and certainly in a way that we look to the year and expected Q2 and Q3 and beyond to play out. We're seeing a lot of those elements that we expected starting to show through in the results. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And a quick follow-up question. Any color you can provide in quarter-to-date trends? 
W. McMullen: If you look at quarter-to-date, obviously, a year ago, there was a hurricane that affected a couple of our divisions in a meaningful way. And we're in the middle of that happening a year ago. If you exclude those 2 divisions, we would be slightly ahead of where we were in quarter 2, but it's just slightly. And we -- I've excluded those 2 divisions just because until we get through the total cycling, it's really hard to say exactly where we'll be. But continued progress. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, curious, your take on the pharmacy business, right, where it sits today. Obviously, it looks like a fair bit of pressure on EBIT margin. How transitory do you think that is? And when you think about that business long term, I know you've always wanted to kind of own that customer because of the loyalty factor. Do you think about ways to do something with that business, right, to alleviate the pressure on the P&L? 
W. McMullen: The -- one, the one point you made, I think, is incredibly important. If you look at the pharmacy customer, that customer is incredibly loyal to Kroger. And when you look at their total spend, it's a fantastic customer to have. When you look at the pharmacy business overall, it continues to be very, very profitable relative to the assets invested. And obviously, year-on-year, there's headwind. But when you look at the total business, it still continues to be a strong business.
 The other thing is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job on -- to identifying opportunities to build the business, which obviously get a flow-through benefit of that, and significant operating changes to take costs out of the business. Now taking costs out of the business mitigated a meaningful part of the gross pressure, but still, there is more things to be done on taking costs out and process changes. So when you look at the business overall, I'm incredibly excited about the progress we're making. But looking forward, I think it's still a critical and important component of our overall business strategy. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then secondly, when you think about the Ocado rollout, right, one, much pressure on 2020. I know they won't open until '21 and probably a little pressure on '20. But then secondly, do you yet have sort of an ideal budget for the Ocado progression, right? From day 1 it opens, the shed is unprofitable by some amount and the time to profitability is x number of months or quarters. I know it's theoretical, but have you been able to get your arms around that? 
W. McMullen: Well, I would say we have an estimate on expectations on that, and it would be different depending on whether it's in existing market or a new market. And if you look at our budget expectations in a new market, it would take longer for ramp to profitability versus an existing market where you can move volume over on day 1.
 The modeling that we've done is really using the experience Ocado has had in their ramp-ups in England and adjusting it for traffic patterns in the U.S. locations of our stores, location of customers and labor rates and those types of things. Obviously, until you get a facility open, you don't know whether all of those assumptions are correct. We would typically expect a facility to be somewhere year 2 to year 3 before it gets to profitability. But that is -- time will tell but the best of our estimates and best of the experience that Ocado has had.
 The other thing that we're hoping is if you look at each facility Ocado has opened, it keeps -- it gets better on a ramp-up than the prior one. And one of the nice things is that Ocado will open up a facility in Canada that we'll be able to learn from as well plus the learnings they've had. And that's the one piece that we haven't included in the budget is the fact that they keep getting better. 
Gary Millerchip: And the other piece to mention and you referred to it in your opening comments as well, we're learning a lot more as we continue to see as customers evolve digitally, engaging with us. And so we have a clear model in our mind of what our expectations are, but that model continues to evolve as we learn how customer behavior changes between delivery to home, between pickup at the store and really making sure that we're optimizing the efficiency and the innovation from Ocado to really support the whole digital ecosystem. And I think that's going to continue -- gets more exciting as we think about how the way the customer is changing and how Ocado can meet those needs in the future as well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And Gary just implied and I talked about it in the prepared remarks, Ocado is significantly more efficient than the way we're doing it today. 
Operator: The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: So Rodney, I wanted to ask you about 2020. And I know you talked about -- that you're thinking you'll grow FIFO operating profit. You didn't want to give a lot more detail, but I was hoping that you can provide some additional color around the key drivers to that. And then I also wanted to ask, because you've pulled guidance now, which is okay because no one thought you were going to get there. But you've also introduced uncertainty to investors because we don't know what you're thinking. Is there some minimum expectation that you could at least speak to today to help us out in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 and where this business is going? 
W. McMullen: Yes. A couple of comments. And as you mentioned, we'll get to a whole lot more detail in November on all the pieces, and we'll also talk about 2020 and beyond. If you look at the key drivers, it would continue to be identical sales growth. Obviously, managing our gross profit margin. We continue to find a lot of cost opportunities, everything from process changes to cost of goods to goods not for resale. And in fact, one of the things that we're identifying there is there's a longer stream of opportunities than what we had even originally expected as part of Restock Kroger.
 On the guidance for 2020, that was the reason that I made the comment that we did want to be clear that we expect 2020 operating profit dollars to grow over 2019 provided guidance, just to make sure that people understood that we do expect a growth. We're in the middle of the process, and it's a process normally we wouldn't finish until March of next year when we would give this next year guidance. We are accelerating it until November because we think it's incredibly important to do that, but we are in the process on specifics. But we did want to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect growth. 
Edward Kelly: All right. So just follow-ups on this. So from a gross margin standpoint, your gross margin ex fuel, pharmacy kind of flattening out. Can we expect that to continue over time? And then secondly, at your leverage target, historically, you've been very good about returning cash to shareholders, particularly through share buyback when your stock is perceived to be undervalued. Could that be a larger portion -- or could that be a larger initiative next year? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks for the follow-up questions. This is Gary. I'll take them in the order that you asked the questions. So on gross margins, certainly, we do continue to invest in price. And as Rodney mentioned, there are significant offsets in the investments that we're making in the way that we're managing cost of goods in the team. And over time, we expect, as we've shared, as we reclassified alternative profit, that will also become a tailwind that offsets investments and helps gross margin as well. So while we certainly believe that price investments are sort of critical part of the strategy, we do expect it to look different from what you would have seen in 2018 and 2017 in terms of a level of investment when you look at the time that we have for 2019 and the rest of the year.
 As you know, we use our data and insights, too, to really understand what's important for the customer. And we're continuing to make sure we're priced right on the products that matter most to the customer, both from everyday pricing and from the way we personalize the offers through using the data that we uniquely have available to us because 96% of data is tethered to a loyalty card. But we also know from customer insights that it's not just about price, and ultimately, our customers decide to shop at Kroger because certainly of value but then also the quality of the products, the personalization that we can offer through our data and the freshness and the experience. And so we do feel good around the plan for the rest of the year as we head into 2020 around how we'll manage those levers.
 From a free cash flow perspective, to the second part of your question, I'll really just maybe reinforce a couple of comments that we made in the prepared remarks that you should certainly expect Kroger to be -- continue to be focusing on how do we maximize free cash flow for the value of our shareholders. We are now about within the range. It's important to us that we demonstrate we are consistently back in the range because there can be some volatility in a retail business, and we want to make sure that we've delivered on our commitment to operate within the range. But certainly now that we're there and we expect to continue to generate free cash flow, we will be looking very closely at what's the most effective way to return capital to shareholders. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: It's also a follow-up on 2020. You mentioned that your cost takeouts and your productivity initiatives are doing better than what you previously expected. But obviously, for you to back off some of your prior target, there are things that are not going as well as you anticipated. So can you give us more detail whether it's your ID sales growth, the market being tougher than you expected, the alternative profit stream. On each of those different levers, can you give us more detail on what's not going as well as you expected? 
W. McMullen: Sure. Yes. A couple of those tie back to what we talked about before. But the pharmacy, obviously, is at a different level than what we expected when we did the original expectations just in terms of market structural changes that's happened to everybody in the industry. Obviously, identical sales made progress -- are making progress, but it's taking us longer than what we expected. If you look at alternative profit, it continues to be ahead of what we expected and continues to grow strongly. And in November, we will give more details on all of those. And productivity and process changes and cost opportunities, we continue to see a big pipeline for those and even more than what we originally expected. And just to remind everybody, we're taking over $1 billion a year of costs out to operate the company. 
Michael Lasser: And my follow-up, Rodney, is when you put together this plan, you had some assumption about the competitive landscape, both from bricks-and-mortar players as well as the emerging digital threat. How is the overall market environment relative to where you thought it was going to be? Is it -- presumably given that you're backing off some of these targets, it's probably a little tougher than you anticipated. Is that fair? 
W. McMullen: No. I would -- when you look at the competitive environment overall, I would say it's pretty similar to what we thought at the time. The pharmacy would be the exclusion to that, that I mentioned. But when you look at new operators in the market, we assumed that it would continue to be important. We've been proactive, especially since we merged with Harris Teeter, making sure that we created seamless experience and have a strong digital offering. And I always tell everybody, job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer; job two is we'll figure out how to make it profitable. And we're indifferent whether somebody shops digitally with us or in a store. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, we actually saw that headwind was less in the second quarter year-on-year from a digital standpoint.
 So when you look at overall, I would say, we would say pretty much what we expected. Pharmacy is a little different. And we knew that there would be a transition period that we needed to transform the company, which is what drove us behind the Restock Kroger commitments. 
Operator: The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Maybe just a couple more follow-ups. I think like Ed said, it's not a big surprise that the guides pulled. Can you clarify if it's just the operating profit piece that's pulled? Is the free cash flow guide still intact? Or is everything gone? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks for the question. So as Rodney mentioned, we really plan to give you far more detail in November. And we felt it was really important that we committed to doing that in 6 or 7 weeks from now to be able to provide all the color. We still have obviously huge confidence in the level of free cash flow that we're generating within the company and continues to be a strength in this year. I do think we would want to provide additional guidance on that alongside, as Rodney mentioned, our future financial strategy and how we create value for shareholders at the November meeting. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. That certainly makes sense. And kind of in terms of what hasn't gone right versus what has, I would imagine that this quarter gives you more confidence in kind of the go-forward process. ID is above 2%, gross margin ex fuel and the pharmacy down in the low double-digit range. Is part of the, I would say, pulling or pushing out operating profit dollar growth to perhaps beyond 2020, is part of that getting back to a more normalized supermarket operating environment and delivery of supermarket operating income growth? And can we expect that kind of this quarter and the guidance for the next couple quarters is indicative of what you think a normalized level is? 
W. McMullen: We'll get into more details in November. But a couple of comments I would add to your comments, and I mentioned it in the first quarter earnings call. If you look at the things that we measure internally in terms of how -- the feedback customers give us on what kind of experience we're giving them, what we find is that there's always a lag behind identical sales and when the customer tells us we're doing a better job. And when you look at the second quarter, we certainly felt like that was a reflection of that and we continue to improve the experience. To get into a lot more details on it, I really think we're probably better off to where we have a lot of time in November where we can go line by line. But I do think it was important for everybody to understand we do expect 2020 to have operating profit growth over the '19 confirmed commitment. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. If I can just squeeze one follow-up. Is there a way you can address maybe market share in the quarter relative to your market share trends over the last few -- I mean 2.2% is certainly well above kind of industry scanner data. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share overall, we would say basically it's flat. It's within -- it's probably up or down as mentioned, but I would say we're not satisfied, but it's moving in the right direction. 
Operator: The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Actually, 2 questions. Rodney or Gary, the continued rollout of delivery and pickup, can you give us some help thinking about the shape of that impacting your EBITDA margin? Is it -- do you get to a point later this year or next year where you start to anniversary pressures and you see alleviation from the pressures of that rollout? Any kind of help on that would be great. And second, I just want to follow up on the dry grocery inflation commentary. Is that something that's building momentum? Is that CPG company pressure? Is that something that is a tailwind for IDs in the back half and maybe into next year? That would be helpful as well. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. 
Gary Millerchip: So on digital, first of all, we are certainly -- continue to be very excited around what we see in the way that customers engage with us differently as they start to become more of a -- Rodney referred to as a seamless customer where we're delivering for the customer both, whether it's delivery to home or ship to home. And everything we see about the way that customer engages more deeply with us shows the value of that overall relationship across all the channels of store and digital working together. I know we've shared before that when we look at spend lift, we see a significant spend lift from the customer when they fill that first basket, it's a much higher basket and a significant part of that spend is incremental. And then over time, we also see customers actually move to a position where their visits in the store actually increase as well as they overall build their loyalty with us.
 And so you're right, Robby, it's very much a maturation curve, if you like. And so we monitor every store and every vintage of the business that goes through that maturation of launching pickup and launching delivery to home. And what we see is that, that curve where by about year 2, year 3 of the customer engagement in those stores, we start to become really agnostic around how the customer is shopping with us because of the incrementality that we see overall in that behavior and how that mold to Kroger.
 So as they're starting to come through that maturity curve, that's really what Rodney was referring to when he mentioned that we start to see digital less of a financial headwind in the Q2 this year and then into the second half of this year because we're really starting to see the maturation of that business, partly the customer behavior obviously accelerating, but also because we don't have the same start-up costs and the same investments in launching those services.
 So we certainly expect that to continue, and we are very focused on how do we maintain and accelerate the growth of customer engagement through digital. We were pleased that we have continuation of digital household engagement growing again during the quarter, and that's very much a focus for us. As we continue to grow their loyalty and we get past that maturation point, as Rodney said, it's still an investment overall for the business. So where we get even more excited when you think about the technology with Ocado and the opportunity to automate some of the back-end operation, if you like, providing those services because that has the potential to significantly shorten the path to profitability as well when you think about the way the customer shops with us seamlessly overall. 
Robert Ohmes: So would you say, Gary, that the peak EBITDA margin pressure from the rollout of pickup and delivery has been passed and we just passed it this quarter? 
Gary Millerchip: That's essentially what we're seeing overall within the way we look at our digital business and the way you look at that customer maturation. That's right. But that's kind of what Rodney was referring to. 
W. McMullen: And Gary -- I agree with Gary's point, and we also continue to invest in Ship and some of the other components as well. That is a high start-up cost, but that's even reflected in the numbers that Gary talked about. 
Robert Ohmes: Great. And then just on the inflation outlook for dry grocery and what's driving that. 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Obviously, we deal with the question of CPG partners addressing price increases all the time. It's something that we deal with on a case-by-case basis, and we feel we're in a particularly strong position to really understand what's happening there because of our own brand products and the way in which we can have those conversations to make sure that the price increases are legitimate cost increases coming through to us. Certainly, as we shared, we are seeing our range for the year on inflation which we were assuming it would be somewhere between 0 to 1% and what we're actually seeing in a couple of those categories that I mentioned in the prepared comments that we're slightly ahead of that range. We continue to obviously manage to try and mitigate those through cost of goods opportunities and certainly where we do see the price increases coming through. And we believe they're legitimate, we are looking to pass them on to customers where it makes sense in light of the competitive environment. 
W. McMullen: The other thing, Gary, just one addition that I think is always important to remind and we always remind our CPG partners, if they're raising costs more than the market is going up, our own brands always gains share. And it's incredible, strong quality product obviously. It's something that has been part of Kroger for a long, long time. And we continue to even be -- add more innovation and more lines in terms of the Kroger brand itself, Private Selection and Simple Truth. So anytime a CPG adds -- changes cost versus what the market is doing from raw materials, what happens is our brands gain share as well, and that's also something I think is important to remind everybody. 
Operator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Karen Short: Just curious. So back to the 2020 goals, I mean, obviously, you gave a pretty detailed answer on what was a little tougher. I think pharmacy stands out and ID is obviously taking a little longer. But fuel has obviously been a much bigger tailwind for you. So -- and I get that hasn't changed. That's been the case, fuel continues to be a tailwind for you. So I guess what I'm curious about is what really changed from 1Q when you reiterated the $3.5 billion to today? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks for the question, Karen. Certainly, from a fuel perspective to kind of cover the first part, you're absolutely right. From an overall performance of the business this year, we feel the fuel business has continued to demonstrate great strength. And it demonstrates the sort of the value, we believe, in the diversity of the portfolio of business that we now have. Obviously, everything is built up the foundation of food and that frequency of shop and the way customers are engaging with us and the loyalty we create. But when you think about food alongside health care, the fuel margins that we're generating in our alternative profit streams, we feel good about the way it allows us to manage through some of these changes as they -- as we see them that are outside of our control, and particularly in the case of the pharmacy headwinds that we referred to earlier on the call.
 As we talk around 2020, as Rodney mentioned, we do want to make sure we provide you with a lot more color at the November meeting around how we're thinking about the growth in the business. I know Rodney has obviously already referred to a couple of elements around areas of the business that we've learned a lot. And as you alluded to in your comments, we've shared, I think, very openly that we embarked on a major transformation for the company, which involved transforming the experience in the stores. And digitally, it involves standing up a number of new businesses around alternative profit streams and taking a dramatic amount of costs out of the business.
 So I think a lot of what we've been learning, as we've shared, is that as we get smarter and better in understanding how will those pieces come together and the speed at which they will deliver the benefits that we're expecting to Restock Kroger, we thought it was important to share with you today that we do believe that we'll deliver growth next year and operating -- FIFO operating profit over the confirmed guidance for 2019 and that we want to make sure that we spend the appropriate amount of time in November really taking you through what's worked, the areas where we believe we still have opportunity to improve and how we see 2020 further shaping up. 
W. McMullen: And 2020 and beyond as well. 
Karen Short: Okay. That is fair. And then I guess looking at the results this quarter, given obviously, again, strong fuel, I get core down 30-ish, 31% in 2Q. And I think it's fair to say that some of that is not within your control because it is pharmacy-related. So wondering if you could just get me -- give some color as to whether or not that number is kind of consistent with where your numbers shake out. But also maybe if you could parse out what the actual pharmacy, both specialty and regular pharmacy, might have done in terms of pressuring the core. 
Gary Millerchip: I think that the best guidance we can give, kind of if we just refer back to a few of the points that we shared in the release and some of the comments that we made, Rodney mentioned it, from a supermarket perspective, when you take out fuel and retail pharmacy, essentially, the operating margins are relatively stable. And the pharmacy and the Kroger specialty pharmacy business were obviously a meaningful headwind during the quarter because of some of the industry headwinds that we see overall.
 But when you look at the investment in gross margin of 12 basis points that we shared around the supermarket business, excluding retail, pharmacy and fuel, and then the 14 basis points of OG&A benefit that we saw in the quarter, that's kind of really where I think is the best kind of data we would point you to, to give you a sense of what's going on in the business. And obviously, the gross margin, excluding fuel gross margin, investment was 29 basis points. And you get a sense of the disconnect, if you like, between what the health business impact to the quarter versus what the core retail gross margin investment was excluding pharmacy.
 Sorry, we just have time for one last question. 
Operator: And that question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Thomas Palmer: It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Just a couple quick ones for you. First, you called out hurricanes as a tailwind a year ago for the third quarter. Is -- I mean, is there going to be some offset in the southeast just given what we've seen with maybe people stocking up for Dorian? 
W. McMullen: Dorian was helped a little bit but not to the same degree as the hurricanes last year hit that center. And if you look in terms of just timing, the next 3 or 4 days will look altogether different because when a hurricane actually hits, then you have stores closed and customers aren't able to get into the business, into our stores. The thing about -- as you know, in hurricanes, you never know when the next one is going to hit. And what we always try to do is to make sure that we're ready there in advance for our customers. We support our associates and we're there. As soon as it's safe to be back, we get our stores back and open and operating. And we'll have -- our associates will go to whatever store they can get to, to work versus their home store. But anything at all, as soon as it's safe -- we understand we're an essential component of a community and make sure we're there for them. So I always say Kroger is at its best when there's events like this happens in terms of supporting communities and people. 
Thomas Palmer: And then you've alluded to kind of the ability to look towards share repurchases again. Is that contemplated in your guidance for this year? Or would that essentially be upside if you go that direction? 
W. McMullen: At this point, we really haven't made any decision on repurchases for the balance of the year. And if there was anything, it would be extremely modest. As you know, we just now got back into the range. As Gary mentioned, we want to make sure that we're judicious and not -- and look at cash flow as it's being generated and balance all the pieces. So at this point, I think it's a little early to say. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: I think that's right, Rodney. Certainly, we're actively looking and making sure that we're maximizing free cash flow. But at this point, we want to make sure we're consistent within the range and as soon as we feel we're in that position, but it's certainly not contemplated currently in the guidance that we provided for 2019. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, everyone, for all the questions. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates who listen in and how we all live our purpose every day.
 To our associates, thank you for your hard work. I am fortunate to meet so many of you across the company and hear the incredible stories of what you do every day for each other and the communities. From our stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, you inspire me beyond my ability to express in words. Your passion for and focus on our customers is just incredible. More importantly, I am so proud of how you support each other and come together as a team. We are 460,000 strong, and we are Kroger proud.
 September is a special month for us as it marks the second anniversary of Kroger's social impact plan, Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. We know we can't achieve this goal alone. And recently, the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation announced its inaugural cohort of 7 innovators who will join us in achieving our bold goal. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining, and we look forward to seeing you in November. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-06-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. 
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. 
 We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the discipline, focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan: Restock Kroger. All of this work starts with our customer-obsession focus. That is why we're building an omnichannel platform to serve customers with Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by existing -- exciting partnerships that create additional value. That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it's important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range.
 One of our most powerful competitive advantages is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3%, and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands, such as Private Selection, led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. We know that our customers love Our Brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. 
 In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brands items. Our customers' favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection pork belly bites, Private Selection artisan jerky and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl Ice Cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter.
 Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pickup or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pickup or delivery services or ship. Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omnichannel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I called this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made.
 2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. 
 We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado. Kroger's partnership with Ocado will, for the first time, introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This, in turn, means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America.
 We are also making progress building out our alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on our alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle, built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic, to improve the customer experience, which then supports new margin-rich, asset-light businesses. We expect alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our Media businesses and customer data insights. 
 There are other initiatives within our alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks.
 One of the challenges transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotable next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our new business development, including partnerships, and Kroger's alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed and made in partnership with Kroger's Board of Directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new senior vice presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward.
 Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phaseout of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interest. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use.
 Because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments.
 Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who's been in the CFO role since April. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities: in store, pickup, delivery and ship.
 As Rodney discussed, we have a few headwinds during the first quarter, including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. 
 I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan. And alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019.
 On that note, last quarter, we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements.
 Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to Table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification.
 Through the first quarter of 2019, alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with Media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our Media business and the seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters.
 Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. 
 We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. 
 Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items, decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with the Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. 
 Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents-per-gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. 
 Turning now to talent development. We are supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today, I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most clerks, and associates will receive regular wage increases every 6 months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.
 We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after 6 months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. 
 In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky, during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. 
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion during -- since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YouTechnology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so.
 I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YouTech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term service agreement with Inmar. YouTech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light, margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. 
 Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include our liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. 
 Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the year. For 2019, identical sales growth, excluding fuel, we continue to target identical rates that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. 
 Rodney, back to you. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision, to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Rodney, my question is could you talk a little bit about, now that you're 1/4 into this year, how your price investment plan is trending? Is it more or less than what you were expecting? And maybe remind us what kind of price investment year 2019 is expected to be and maybe weave that into how that plays out into the expectation for accelerating IDs, and then also maybe weave in just the environment you're seeing out there competitively. We're seeing signs of the promotional environment in produce being a little more aggressive than it's been in a while. If you could weave the picture together for us, that would be great. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. If you look at the '19 investments, it would be a reasonable amount. It will not be as much as what we did in '18 because, as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our '19 investments into '18 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. 
 When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes. And overall, we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more. But when you look it all in all, it looks pretty consistent with before. 
 On accelerating the identicals, it really is -- one of the things on space optimization, now it's becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been -- has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience, which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. 
Operator: The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Maybe, first, just a follow-up on IDs. Can you help us with the cadence throughout the quarter? It sounded like when you gave the quarter-to-date update with fourth quarter earnings that you were running better than where you finished the quarter, and obviously things are expected to accelerate. So beyond remodels, has there been enough contribution from the rollout of online grocery and the impact of inflation relative to your expectations? 
W. McMullen: Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make -- tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a wall, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything. But there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of -- if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all those things. As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth. And if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we're looking at the second quarter so far, it's only 3 weeks, but we are moving closer to the '19 guidance. 
Gary Millerchip: Rodney, the only thing I would add... 
Judah Frommer: Okay. Great. And then... 
Gary Millerchip: So I think the question was asked around digital, too, as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results, and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating, both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. And if I could quickly follow up on Media. It sounds like trends are going kind of in line with or above plan there. Clearly, some of your big-box competitors have made moves in the media space, sometimes acquiring external assets. Is that something you feel like you need to do? Does their leaning into these retailer-led platforms help your conversations with vendors? Or does it serve as more competition? 
W. McMullen: Yes. For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand -- and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer. And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced, for all of us to be successful, just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. 
 In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. 
Operator: The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Yes. Just, first, a clarification. The planned real estate transaction in the quarter, if I look at the cash flow statement, there is about a $57 million gain. Is that the amount that we should be thinking about that contributed to the quarter? 
Gary Millerchip: Jeff, it's Gary. That's right, Ed. We -- as we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often, they can be some losses as well as gains sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that onetime transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated, and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. 
Edward Kelly: Any other planned real estate transactions like this contemplated for the full year? 
Gary Millerchip: I think we are always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist, but they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. 
W. McMullen: And, Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, it's in the guidance. 
Edward Kelly: Rodney, my real question here is for you, and it's on the IDs. And bigger picture, you used to consistently outperform a broader peer set and industry data like Nielsen. And to me, one of the biggest issues right now with your company is that, that actually no longer seems to be happening. And your IDs are just north of 1% this quarter despite the fact that you have digital in there, specialty's in there now. You are lapping some optimization. You've invested a lot last year. I guess why do you think the share gains have slowed so much? And I know you're focused on improving momentum, but what specific adjustments are you making? 
W. McMullen: It really is, for us, to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. And so part of the -- and this is using the data that we track every week, how are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock and all of those pieces. And the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. The other part is some of the things I mentioned before, is just cycling space optimization and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing and using the data in a continued, sophisticated way but even growing upon that as what we've had in the past. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I actually wanted to touch on food inflation. Can you maybe get a little bit more granular in terms of what you're seeing currently and your expectations going forward? And then maybe you could talk about, are you seeing prices being passed through to the shelf at this point? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we'd see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%. That was what we've built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. Certainly, as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. One of the things that obviously we feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through. And of course, it's a great set of knowledge for us knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increases. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. That's helpful. And then... 
Gary Millerchip: I think our outlook... 
Erica Eiler: Oh, no, keep going. 
Gary Millerchip: No. I was just going to say I think our outlook for the year, in general, would be in the -- would be similar to what we've been experiencing, except for, of course, some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on some potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously 1 or 2 items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. 
W. McMullen: And tariffs from China has pretty minimal effect on us, and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully, something works out there. As you know, overall, from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day, tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. No. That's great additional color. And then just quickly on gross margins. Can you talk about the dynamics going on with pharmacy right now and the industry as it relates to gross margin and how you're thinking about kind of those dynamics going forward? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context on our pharmacy business, too, because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty overall with the customer, and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly, as we mentioned, during the quarter. And it ties very closely for us to our health and wellness strategy. And as we start to think about food as medicine, we think it's a very important connection. 
 The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play, really, within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1 which, as I mentioned, wouldn't be unique to us. The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PPM agreements, 3 of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in costs there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that, both from how do we buy most effectively but also how do we create more efficiency in the pharmacy business. And we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order, and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. 
W. McMullen: And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our Own Brands and other things that I mentioned, in total, we still had great results. And also, as we look -- move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life. And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our OptUP app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier, and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: Rodney, can you address the topic of the organization's capacity for change, right? So you've got a lot of change going on. You've got people in new roles. Do you think that, all of that, other than maybe space optimization, is impacting execution in any way and maybe impacting your top line growth? And then as you go forward, if there might be some of that, is there a way to sort of streamline things, prioritize so that maybe there's -- you impact the organization's ability to manage that change better? Curious to your thoughts on that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. A great question, John, and it's something that we talk about, obviously, routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had -- it's a huge opportunity -- we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to --  for us to ask ourselves is, is it center of plate or corner of plate, [ corner of that ]? And if it's center, that's incredibly important. So I feel incredibly good about the people that we've put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. 
 We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help us supplement the internal talent that we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents. And on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. 
 So it's -- to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people in role over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes. And it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth, so it's making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. 
John Heinbockel: And then I know it's early, but what have you learned with the Walgreen test in Cincinnati, particularly as you kind of look forward to opening up the Ocado sheds in non-Kroger markets? Have you learned anything definitive or not yet? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been incredibly positive is Walgreens, their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner. And both of us are learning things, the customer likes and dislikes, together, and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. Sure. I think that some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all, by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky, alongside 10 of our own stores with the pickup service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're even a different level of convenience than we were before. And this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight, whether it's for lunch or dinner, and that's certainly a real positive. What we find generally with the small-format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with their shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small-format stores, and we've seen it over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really poring over the data and making sure that we're using a data-driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. 
Michael Lasser: Can you give us more clarity on how the past year -- full year operating profit guidance works? Thus far, you're trending a little bit below your ID sales range, even currently in the quarter. Sounds like the pharmacy gross margin pressure has been greater than you expected, and you got a real estate gain in the first quarter and yet your profits were still down. So what's the path that you can take from here to get to your operating profit guidance for the full year? And at what point do you see more risk that it would be harder to get to that level? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the -- if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the c-store business during the first quarter, and we sold YouTech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. And as I mentioned, the alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think that's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney, so thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job of looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business, and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and we'll continue to pull that give us the ability to make sure that we continue to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customer and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model. And we continue to find additional opportunities, whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in goods not for resale and cost of goods. And so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020. 
Michael Lasser: And then my follow-up question is on your price investment. Recognizing that there's been a lot of noise in your IDs over the last couple of quarters given the disruption from the store remodels, do you think your price investments are as effective as they might have been in the past? And if they are, will you have to reaccelerate your price investments in the coming quarters to drive higher IDs this year? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- one of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price, and we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they're looking at their price as well. When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what's the experience they get from associates, what's the freshness of the fresh departments, and we've continued to rate strong in terms of -- if you look at produce, meat, seafood, delis, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer, where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then, obviously, fuel is an important part of that overall equation. So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great, and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at -- as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: I had a couple of questions on operating profit. First, wanted to ask just about your 3-year plan. I didn't really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don't want to read too much into it. But can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you've pointed out in the past, I think The Street is skeptical of getting to that given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill and there's a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition and now with this real estate transaction. That was $57 million, I think. So that's about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren't aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan, so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? 
Gary Millerchip: Sure. Yes. I think as you think about the Restock Kroger Plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we've identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we're feeling very good about the -- what we've learned through the process around where we unlock and how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you've heard us talk about, alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be, if anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there. As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying, I would say, more cost savings as we are working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there in becoming a more efficient operator. I do think, as we've shared all the way along and Rodney has been consistent in his comments, that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That's an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we're committed to achieve in the second half of this year and obviously into 2020. So I think as you pull those 3 pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there. And I would say in the levers that we intended to pull, where we are in the journey with those levers, we're feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we're still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. 
Kelly Bania: And any comment on the Home Chef, Turkey Hill, the real estate, how those are part of the $400 million, the exact impact of those? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. The -- so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we're baselined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion, if you recall, in '17, going to $3.5 billion. There maybe a couple of -- they're certainly not going to be drastically material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. We certainly don't contemplate, as we think about the run rate and the value that we'll be generating in 2020, that one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We've built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We're not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn't drive the value. 
 The Home Chef certainly isn't in the $400 million, and the Turkey Hill sale gains certainly is included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are, that's why we've kind of stripped those out from the performance and what we've shared as our progress in the year. None of those, or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain that would be, if you like, filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups to that. I guess can you share with us where you see your FIFO operating profit with all the adjustments these, I guess, 5 quarters through the plan? And then in terms of alternative profit. So I think you said in the past, there was a 20% increase this year. Does that equate to the $100 million that you're now talking about? And can you remind us what the last year and next year is kind of planned at? 
W. McMullen: Well, on alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was -- last year, was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at '17, if I remember right, Gary, and you'll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. So it's... 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. 
W. McMullen: It's continuing to accelerate as we learn what to -- how to do it. And if you look at like the Media business, we've recruited professionals that know how to grow that business, so we're actually accelerating where we are. 
 On the 5 quarters and stuff, I think we're probably -- would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up to make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help -- be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. 
Gary Millerchip: Absolutely. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Prykull: So I guess, firstly, on the composition of gross margin, the change year-over-year and maybe the cadence for the rest of the year, a couple of components to that. So how much of the 40 basis point nonfuel decline can be attributed to pharmacy? Should we expect a similar headwind for the rest of the year? Will that improve? You mentioned alternative profits can be lumpy. Anything to keep in mind from a margin contribution seasonally? And then you're lapping some supply chain investments in the fourth quarter. I understand that. Any sense for mix shift towards Our Brands and the contribution there? 
W. McMullen: On the -- I'll start, and I'll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments, in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. 
 If you look at Our Brands, as I always tell people, Our Brands margin typically is 600 to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously, it's a higher sales part. And when you look at the gross margin per item, it's usually $0.01 or $0.02 higher on a cents-per-item profit basis. In terms of Rx and the balance of the year, Gary, I'll let you go into a little bit of the details there. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. So certainly, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth. Those 2, combined, would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. We're feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year. And as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don't expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. That being said, obviously, we manage the business very dynamically. It's important that we're able to adapt on pricing, continue to invest where it makes sense and where the customer tell us they really value it, and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. So we tend to really focus on how we're managing the business to make sure that we're achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. 
 We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we're finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce cost-saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. 
W. McMullen: And alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of the gift cards and the other related items. We have time for one more question. 
Operator: And that question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. And Mr. Cerankosky dropped out -- dropped his line. 
 The next question will be from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. 
Michael Montani: Just on the core gross margins for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments in the pharmacy? What are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend, if you could. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going to buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment. But the -- as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things, which funded quite a bit of investment as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? 
Gary Millerchip: No. I think you said it well, Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Okay. Good. Thanks, Michael. 
 Before we end today's call, one of the things that's exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how all of us live our purpose every day. 
 As America's grocer, Kroger takes seriously our role in celebrating our uniquely American heritage during the patriotic season between Memorial Day and Independence Day. It always makes me feel incredibly proud that Kroger employs so many men and women who have served or currently serve in the Armed Forces. I got a chance to personally live our purpose last Saturday with our Veterans Associate Resource Group who put on a 5K run to raise money for veterans. While I certainly didn't finish first and nowhere close to last either, I would like to add, in the race, I did have a different kind of first: touring a specifically designed tiny house that our caring associates dreamed up and then built for a deserving local veteran and his family. The home was built to green technology standards, made from recycled materials and features solar panels, demonstrating our associates' commitment to and passion for Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. In addition to the home, our Cincinnati/Dayton division donated a Kroger gift card and a bag of Our Brands products to turn a new tiny house into a home, and it really felt great. One of the many ways Kroger shows our gratitude and appreciation to all of our service members and their family is through our long-standing commitment to the USO. Kroger is the single-largest donor to the USO, contributing over $22 million over the past decade. In keeping with this commitment, we will be presenting the USO with $1 million donation and a Barbecue for the Troops event we are hosting at Fort Stewart in July. It is our honor and privilege as America's grocer to serve America's heroes. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year. 
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-03-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge that the team here at Kroger realizes that we have our work cut out for us as the market points out this morning. We realized business transformations are harder -- hard. But I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments. We look forward to our time together to take your questions and try to better lay things out for you. 
 Joining me on today's call are Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Gary Millerchip, for the first time, Mike's successor, who will become Kroger's CFO on April 4. As previously announced, Mike will continue to serve as EVP and a member of our senior team until the end of the year. We can't say enough how grateful the entire Kroger team is for Mike's service, leadership and stewardship of the company for the last 34 years, especially during the last 19 as CFO. We are also incredibly fortunate to have Gary, whose deep finance and business background combined with his successful track record of creating shareholder value as a member of our senior officer team, makes him the right person to carry Kroger forward. This is especially true as Kroger transforms from grocer to growth company. I've talked before about the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant. This constant reinvention takes place at least every decade. Gary has been instrumental in helping us think through our transformation as part of Restock Kroger and beyond. He is uniquely positioned to be Kroger's Chief Financial Officer of the future and, as such, will also help shape the future of our omnichannel experience and reporting. 
 During today's call, Mike will provide the financial and operations recap for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, and Gary will outline Kroger's guidance for 2019. 
 In October 2017, we introduced Restock Kroger, our 3-year plan to create shareholder value by serving America through food, inspiration and uplift. The plan has 4 main drivers: redefine the grocery experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value. Specifically, we committed to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative restock cash flow by the end of 2020. I'm pleased to report that Kroger solidly delivered on our key year 1 Restock Kroger commitments. When you look at the full year, we delivered against our FIFO operating profit and our Restock cash flow goals, which sets us up to reach our 2020 targets. We improved identical sales and delivered EPS near the high end of our -- both our original and adjusted guidance range, giving us both business momentum heading into 2019. And I'm especially proud that we achieved our -- an unprecedented cost savings of more than $1 billion through process improvements in 2018. Restock Kroger is fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. 
 We continue to make significant investments to build an omnichannel platform that will deliver customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. At the end of 2018, 91% of Kroger households have access to pickup or delivery. By the end of 2019, with full integration of Kroger Ship into our ecosystem, we will reach 100% of America. We are very pleased with the growth of digital sales at Kroger. In 2018, our digital sales run rate was about $5 billion. Going forward, we are trending toward a run rate of approximately $9 billion. Kroger also grew Our Brands to reach a record 30.5% unit share in the fourth quarter. We introduced 1,022 new items in 2018, which helped drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. Simple Truth continued to lead the way with a 15.3% sales growth in 2018, making it a $2.3 billion brand. 
 Kroger unveiled several transformative partnerships to create customer value in 2018. Home Chef continues to grow and shape today's meal solution space. In February, we announced Home Chef's expansion to 500 more locations and 6 new store divisions. Our pilots with Walgreens, Microsoft and Nuro continue to generate great customer insights. The Nuro pilot in Scottsdale is nearly complete, and we are planning to enter another market early this year. We remain optimistic about all the ways our partnership with Ocado will set Kroger up for accelerated growth in the future. In February, we announced Florida and the mid-Atlantic region is where we plan to build the next 2 Ocado sheds in addition to the first location planned for Southwest Ohio. 
 In 2018, we accelerated investments in associates and significantly improved employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. And we were thrilled to be recognized on Fortune Magazine's Change the World 2018 list for using Kroger's scale for good, engaging our business to solve society's most complex issues through Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This groundwork positions us to deliver on our 2020 Restock Kroger targets, including financials, and transform the company for long-term growth. 
 I want to take a few minutes to talk in more detail about our alternative businesses. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top and bottom lines. That's why in February, we announced the appointment of Stuart Aitken to the newly created role of Senior Vice President alternative business. In this new role, Stuart is assuming oversight for Kroger's successful existing alternative profit businesses, including 84.51° and Kroger Personal Finance. Stuart will also lead the development of a full portfolio of alternative businesses to support the transformation of Kroger's business model and to better support our customers and supermarket business. 
 Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51° and media all beat their operating profit targets for the year. This was very encouraging as these are the biggest line items in our alternative profit businesses. We used some of the excess profit to invest into other new alternative profit streams to begin seeding our margin-rich, asset-light businesses of the future. In 2019, we expect 20% profit growth in our alternative businesses, and we'll also launch a few more new businesses that are both symbiotic to our core and deliver high margins. 
 Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. We will grow market share by creating a virtuous cycle built on our grocery business. At the core is a winning combination of unmatched local presence coupled with a digital ecosystem that enables us to offer our customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. We are enhancing the customer ecosystem with partnerships that are helping us to redefine the customer experience by building incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering and unprecedented convenience. A constantly improving customer ecosystem generates traffic, customer data and insights, which then fuel the growth of adjacent alternative profit streams. We see tremendous potential in these asset light, margin-rich businesses built on the foundation of an omnichannel grocery experience. The profits generated by these businesses will create shareholder value and generate cash to invest in Kroger's core so we can further redefine the grocery customer experience. This is how Kroger's new growth model is a virtuous cycle. 
 Above all, Restock Kroger positions Kroger to create long-term shareholder value. We have a clear path to achieve the $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative Restock cash flow by the end of 2020. We finished 2018 with sales and business momentum. We expect earnings growth and an improving supermarket business in 2019. 
 Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting on Rodney's comments to start the call, it's kind of surreal to know that this is my 77th and final earnings call as CFO. I'm thrilled to be transitioning the role to Gary, who is a terrific partner and will be an excellent Chief Financial Officer. 
 Looking at our results for 2018, I'm very proud of the entire team at Kroger for delivering on the key Restock Kroger commitments we made back in October of 2017. Landing the first year of a 3-year plan is always the toughest and most critical since everything that follows builds on the foundation that gets built. We feel great about the foundation we've built, which sets us up to create shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments to grow the business. There were a variety of factors that affected fourth quarter in either the OG&A or gross profit line. As a result of better retention and higher average hourly rate, our vacation accrual was a $0.02 headwind in the quarter and incentive pay because of achieving the ID sales we did, and the [ CPS ] was a $0.06 headwind. Both of these affected OG&A. As I said, our incentive plan was primarily based on the grid of EPS and ID sales. As EPS got closer to the top end of the range, we were incentivized to continue to make sustainable investments in our business to grow sales. Some of these investments were in our supply chain for both supermarket business as well as Kroger Ship. On a combined basis, this was about $0.04 per share. These items affected gross profit. When you add these together, it was about a $0.12 headwind to the fourth quarter, a lot of which is something that we're going to be able to build on for the future. 
 Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.34 compared to $0.198 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.34 versus $2.46 in the same quarter last year, which affected total revenue. For 2018, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.252 compared to $0.206 for the year before. The average retail price of fuel for 2018 was $2.66 compared to $2.36 in 2017. 
 The solid investments that we've made in 2018 will help the supermarket business have a better 2019 overall. We do, however, expect fuel to deliver lower operating profit margin in 2019 compared to 2018. 
 Identical sales momentum continued into the fourth quarter where our ID sales result was about 10 basis points improvement over last year's fourth quarter. There is no doubt that weather events and the acceleration of SNAP disbursements helped ID sales results in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to distinguish between the 2 because they occurred at essentially the same time. Combined, snow and SNAP helped ID sales by 44 basis points in the quarter. We continue to feel good about our ability to meaningfully connect with customers who rely on SNAP to supplement their food purchases. 
 While space optimization was a slight headwind versus the slight tailwind we expected, we saw strong progress. Stores that had been open for 12 weeks and unaffected by a new competitor had positive results in the quarter. And admittedly, this is taking longer than we originally expected, but we are pleased to see this result. In 2018, we completed the most disruptive of the remodels. As we go through 2019, the work will be more targeted and, therefore, less disruptive to our customers. All in all, the tide for space optimization is turning as we head into 2019. 
 FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $621 million compared to $782 million in the same period last year without the 53rd week and the 2018 and 2017 adjustment items. For the full year, FIFO operating profit was $2.84 billion compared to $3.13 billion in the same period last year without the 53rd week and the 2018 and 2017 adjustment items and excluding the convenience stores. This was above our goal for the year. And as Gary will discuss in a few minutes, we expect to grow again in 2019, and we remain committed to reaching our Restock Kroger goal at 2020. 
 Kroger's financial strategy is to use its free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. The company actively balances the use of cash to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to invest a combined $589 million in Ocado securities and Home Chef, contribute $185 million pretax to a company-sponsored pension plan, repurchased 79 million common shares for $2 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under an accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid 434 -- $437 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchase of leased facilities. We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of Restock cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger. And in 2019 (sic) [ 2018 ], we delivered $1.9 billion. 
 Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.83. We intend to use our free cash flow to bring the leverage ratio back into the target range of 2.3 to 2.5x. The company's intention is to not buy stock back until we get into that range as we did in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. 
 We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates over the 3 years of Restock Kroger. This is happening in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. In 2018, we made significant investments in wages and used tax reform dollars to invest in our educational systems program, Feed Your Future. We also increased the 401(k) match for nonunion associates, among other benefits aimed at an improved associate experience. This was in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many competitors do not offer. 
 Looking now at labor contracts. We recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering Smith's in Albuquerque. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering the store associates at King Soopers in Denver, Fred Meyer in Portland, Ralph's in Southern California and Kroger in Memphis. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2019, including contracts for UFCW store associates in Seattle, Las Vegas, Indianapolis and Louisville. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 Before I hand it off, I want to reiterate again that the first year of a 3-year plan is difficult to land the first year. But when you step back to review the full year, we feel great about delivering on our financial commitments while continuing to make the investments that will position Kroger for growth in the future. This solid foundation sets us up to transform Kroger and to deliver in 2019 and 2020. 
 And now I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss how we'll build on this momentum in 2019. Gary? 
Gary Millerchip: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to join the call today and more specifically, speak to Kroger's upcoming year, both what we are committing to and how it aligns with the Restock Kroger. For 2019, identical sales growth excluding fuel, we are targeting identical sales that range from 2% to 2.25%. We expect net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and FIFO operating profits to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. The low end of our range is above the current consensus estimate for 2019. 
 Kroger's EPS growth is expected to come from FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver the incremental $400 million in FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020 through Restock Kroger. 
 I'd like to spend a few moments underscoring Kroger's future growth model because the clear path to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit includes alternative profit streams. And although these high-margin and asset-light businesses won't have a major impact on our top line in the near term, they play a significant role in helping us achieve bottom line growth. I have made it a priority to join Mike and Rebekah already for several investor meetings. We as an Investor Relations team recognize and appreciate the request to better understand how to model alternative profit streams going forward. Please know that our finance team is spending time on this very topic, including a review of industry best practices with the goal of providing more detail in the future. 
 In 2018, there were several Restock Kroger successes that have created tailwinds we believe will help us continue to grow sales and achieve incremental FIFO operating profit in 2019. We pulled forward price, digital and store investments in 2018, in part using tax reform dollars, which will create tailwinds for sales and operating profit in 2019. We achieved significant cost savings in 2018 and have plans to accelerate this momentum in 2019. Our largest alternative businesses, Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51° and media, all beat their operating profit targets in 2018 and have plans for continued growth. And while investing to build a seamless ecosystem remained a headwind to earnings in 2018, that dynamic is beginning to shift. 
 As Mike shared in his comments earlier, fuel is expected to be a headwind in 2019 compared to last year. The strength of fuel margins in 2018 helped us make investments that set the supermarket business up well for 2019, but we do expect softer fuel results this year. 
 Looking at the cadence of EPS throughout the year, we expect the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of 2018, the second and third quarters to be within our annual guidance range and the fourth quarter to be above the guidance range, which will allow the full year to land within the range. We anticipate that momentum will build throughout the year and put Kroger in a position of strength going into 2020. We laid the foundation in 2018, which we'll now build on in 2019 to deliver our 2020 commitments. This includes Restock cash flow. We delivered what we expected in 2018, setting us up to meet our $6.5 billion cumulative Restock cash flow commitment by the end of 2020. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion in 2019. This number will likely grow in future years as we announce more Ocado sheds. 
 As Mike also shared earlier, in the short term, our intention is to use free cash flow to bring our leverage ratio back into our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. And finally, we anticipate Kroger's 2019 tax rate to be approximately 22%. 
 Before I turn it back to Rodney, let me say that I'm incredibly grateful to Mike, who has put together a thoughtful week-by-week transition plan. He really has been the best partner I could ask for when transitioning to the role of Kroger's future CFO. Thank you, Mike.
 I am personally very energized to be in a sector that is transforming as quickly as grocery retail. The way we think about the fundamentals of retail is rapidly evolving, which will make next few years incredibly interesting for the financial stakeholders who follow this space. 
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Gary. As America's grocer, Kroger has the winning combination of local presence plus a digital ecosystem, enhanced by strategic partnerships, enabling us to offer our customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. We are transforming from grocer to growth company by deploying our assets to serve even more customers and create margin-rich alternative profit streams. We are well positioned to deliver on our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: So I guess, a question I have -- and I know you try to encourage us not to look at your business in terms of the core and fuel and alternative profits, but you did kind of gave us the slide at the Analyst Day with that depicted, so it's hard not to look at your business this way. But when I look at the full year '18 and I try to break out what the core business actually did, the decline was fairly significant. Like I'm kind of backing into almost 30% decline in the quarter. And I guess, can you help me understand what the components of that are that are maybe just transitory? And then the second part I would just ask is, obviously we're trying to think of you in a way that you're thinking of yourselves, meaning as a growth company. But you need stability in your core to have the credit in your valuation for being a growth company. So maybe a little color on how you can attain that, I guess, stability and/or grow your core. 
J. Schlotman: I'll take that one, Karen. Well, obviously, a lot of -- we made a lot of investments in 2018, which affects a wide variety of different lines. And it's difficult to say, obviously fuel had a good quarter or -- and a good year. When you look at trying to back into the core, what do you do with digital, which has been a headwind, and we continue to invest in digital. If you don't back that headwind out and put that in the growing a new business category, yes, that would drag the core down the way you do it. But if you look at the digital investments we've made along with the other investments we've made, in the fourth quarter, I talked about the new warehouses that we opened up to support our digital business. That -- if you look at that all in the core, yes, the core declined. I won't go into a specific number, but it really is how you slice and dice all of this. All of that said, and I wouldn't necessarily discourage you from looking at the different pieces of the business because we do have to do a better job of helping you all understand and explain where the alternative profit streams are going to come from because some of them won't affect the top line. Some of them will just be profit. But when you're trying to transform the company and you have a first year of a plan, we take all the pieces and all the available flows and profitability together and then decide how to invest them in which business, which is what we did in 2018. 
W. McMullen: And with that said, and Gary mentioned it, we will definitely do a better job helping you be able to see that insight because we certainly understand the question and it makes total sense. 
Karen Short: Okay. And I guess, just a follow-up, then. So if we look at that $3.5 billion for 2020, I mean, you're looking at an EBIT growth of 17%, which is not something I've ever seen any grocer do in a year. But is there anything that has changed in terms of each of the streams versus where you're at in your Analyst Day in terms of the growth rate? 
Gary Millerchip: This is Gary. I think we feel, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we feel very good about the 2019 plan that we have for the business. And kind of referring back to your question, Karen, that you asked and Mike answered, there's a lot of noise obviously in 2018 when you're going through a major year of transition. And we feel that as we head into the second year of the plan, as the pieces come together and we have the tailwinds from some of those investments that we made, we have a strong plan in place that we feel is going to make a difference to the way in which growth is occurring across the organization and where you'll see that in the results that we report out as we shared in the prepared comments. I do think that as we head through 2019 and we're building on the plans that we put in place through Restock Kroger, we expect to see the investments that we made in '19 start to come out in -- sorry, 2018 come through in 2019. And we have a very clear plan of what we expect those benefits then to deliver in 2020. So I think we appreciate, to Rodney's comment, that we have to give you a clearer view into how all those pieces fit together. But I wouldn't say there's anything materially changed in the plan that we have for the 3 years and that we're not seeing all the pieces come together in largely the way that we expected. 
J. Schlotman: Karen, one more thing I would add on the calculation of the decline. And you may have done this, but I would remind you that last year had a 53rd week. And you need to take -- obviously take that out when you compare 2017 to '18. And I think last year, we said that extra week was worth $0.09 or so. 
Karen Short: Yes -- no, no -- yes, we backed everything out. 
J. Schlotman: Okay. Because I wouldn't come up with a number anywhere near where you are. 
Karen Short: Maybe we can follow-up. 
Operator: The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: First thing I wanted to do, is maybe just follow-up on where Karen was going with this. I mean, on the $400 million goal, if we just think about how you started year 1, which you say is on track, but EBIT fell over $200 million. And it would've been down more if not for an epic fuel year. And the biggest decline was in Q4 even if you adjust for that extra week. And I know that you are reaffirming this target, but if you look at 2019 guidance, it's got about $100 million improvement. And it does sound like -- and this is off a big investment year, it does sound like there are some things that should come back to you, which implies a $550 million improvement in 2020. So why isn't there more progress, I guess, in 2019 given what you're going to lap? And then can you give us more comfort around how you see this growth in 2020? I mean, obviously, your stock is down quite a bit today because I don't think the market's seeing progress. The market is kind of seeing the opposite. So if you can just help us to some extent here, I think it would be good. 
J. Schlotman: A couple -- a lot of thought there in your question. One of the things I would point to relative to progress we're making is what Gary said in his prepared comments where if you look at operating profit guidance for next year, it is above where the current consensus estimate is. So in our mind, that does demonstrate progress. When you talk about why wouldn't 2019 grow more given the investments we made in '18, we are expecting a more usual year for fuel margins in 2019 versus 2018. We believe it would be -- it wouldn't be prudent to budget 2019 to replicate 2018 in fuel. So the core business and the alternative profit streams, digital not being as big of an investment, in fact, a little bit of a tailwind when you look at expected investments year-on-year. We first have to overcome in 2019 lower expected operating margin in fuel and then grow off of that. And as we built the business plan with the 2 to 2.25 EBITDA -- or [ ID ] sales, that still gets us to an operating profit margin that's above Wall Street. And if you look at the high end of that range, it's essentially right at what Wall Street would be predicting for 2020. 
W. McMullen: Ed, I mean, we really understand your question. And just to enhance a little bit of what Mike and Gary was talking about, digital, we do expect it to turn to a tailwind versus a headwind. As you know, we accelerated a lot of investments into 2018 that we expect those to pay off in '19. Mike talked about some of those. Obviously, space optimization is one of those. We continue to make great progress on taking costs out of the business. And when you look at all those together then, as Mike mentioned, we also expect fuel to be a headwind when you look at next year total. So totally understand the question. And when we look through and modeling all the pieces, I do think it's important to note when you look at fourth quarter by itself, the incremental $0.12 of charges that Mike talked about, most of which will not reoccur next year. Or if they do, they will be spread out throughout the year versus just in one quarter. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. The gross margin, down 93 basis points was certainly surprising. It does sound like there are some onetime things in here. But can you just give us a little bit more detail on what happened? What is mix by the way? And what did you do in supply chain? And then how do we think about the gross margin in 2019? Because it's hard to get to your EBIT guidance without, I think anyway, flat to positive FIFO gross margins ex fuel. 
J. Schlotman: If you look at the fourth quarter decline, about 1/3 of it, maybe a little less than 1/3 of it was from price investment. So kind of what we've been experiencing all year long. The other 2/3 of it is a combination of startup costs for some new warehouses that negatively affected warehouse and transportation line, that expense line that's in the gross profit as well as continued growth in primarily our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy team had a great year, very strong sales growth out of them. That is a high-growth business that has, as compared to our core business, a dramatically lower gross margin rate. But because the price of each one of those prescriptions is so high, generates very strong operating profit dollars in that business. So those last 2 were about 2/3 or so of the margin erosion and pricing was about 1/3. 
Edward Kelly: And just for next year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think I'm going to give guidance for OG&A and gross profit for next year. If you look at the ID sales, if you look at the earnings per share guidance and we gave you operating profit, there are assumptions that you're going to have to make about where OG&A and gross profit are going to go next year. As Rodney said, some of those investments we made this year won't be as dramatic as they -- as next year. Things like digital not being a headwind and being a tailwind will help margins as well. So we won't be opening new warehouses like we did in 2018. And those startup costs are what cost us on the margin line. 
Operator: And our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: Let me start. When you think about the next couple of years, the alternative profit stream impact on margin rate, EBIT margin rate, right, is the greater impact going to be on gross margin line or the expense ratio line? And then when you guys talk about ex fuel margin, does that include the alternative profit streams today? And will it in the future? Or you'll break that out? 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. On the first question, as I alluded to, we're doing a lot of work right now to really decide how we best can share that story with you because I think as we mentioned in the past, the alternative businesses that we talk about have grown up a little bit as a legacy over the way they would have been within the Kroger business prior to us really in 2017 identifying this as a big strategic growth area for the company and how do we truly leverage all the data and the knowledge that we have about the customer to drive those alternative businesses across Kroger Personal Finance, the media business and some of the other areas that we shared at the analyst meeting. So right now, it would be reported in a number of different areas of the business. And what we really want to do is to make sure that we're very deliberate in identifying and helping you -- provide you with a clearer picture of how you can see that more clearly as the business continues to accelerate growth in 2019 and 2020. 
J. Schlotman: And John, if you look at the OG&A and the fuel -- and the margin rates, excluding fuel, it would include those businesses. We would have a really long list of things to pull out if we didn't do it any other way. 
John Heinbockel: All right. So then as a follow-up, is it possible based on what you said, Gary, is it possible that there will be an alternative profit stream segment? Because again, it's getting so significant. It's so different than the core business, does it makes sense to break out separately for all of them, right, combined, revenue and EBIT? Is that something you're thinking about or amenable to? And then the last thing, if you think about the core business, what comp do you think you need to actually grow EBIT in the core business? Is it 2? Is it -- or given cost pressures, is it higher? Is it 3? What do you think? 
Gary Millerchip: I think for the first part of the question, we're not ruling anything out right now. We're not committing either to what the answer would look like. We really want to make sure that we're deliberate about thinking through the best approach to make sure that we manage this business effectively, but also can clearly demonstrate and show the story of the value it's driving to the bottom line. But certainly committed to reaching some conclusions on that and being clear in 2019 about how to think about and see that. 
W. McMullen: And certainly, when you look at the longer-term model, the 2% to 3%, we would certainly agree with that and would see the same number. For the next couple of years, it might be a little on the low end of that to drive earnings growth. But over time, the sustainability of the model really needs 2% to 3% identicals. 
J. Schlotman: I think it's important to note, John, that if you look at our productivity gains during the year from -- not only from the great year we had from reducing our turnover, which means we increased retention as well as some operational efficiencies inside the store. Our productivity pretty much offset the higher investments we made in associates in the store. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: Just wanted to touch base on the top line. The IDs over the past year were more in the 1.5 to 1.9 range, and just wanted you to just maybe help us better understand the expectations to see acceleration in the business to kind of above 2. Maybe just speak, give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the stores that have gone through the optimization. And we'll start there. I have a follow-up. 
W. McMullen: I love the question. If you look, the last part of your question on space optimization and as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, it certainly has been a headwind longer than we expected. But for the stores that have opened -- that opened or remodeled longer than 12 weeks, we're finally starting to see where that positively adds to our identicals. So it's been slower than we expected, but it's nice to finally see. So obviously, that's a piece of it. We also expect to continue to see improvements from the investments that we made in 2018. If you look at tonnage in '18, it was actually stronger than what the identical sales growth would be. And we continue to see people trading up in products and in size of products as well. So when you look at the maturation of the remodels that we've done, continuing to improve the way -- we've significantly improved in-stocks in some of the core business pieces and tying that all together with the investments we've made is what gives us confidence in the 2% to 2.25% that we shared. 
J. Schlotman: One other thing relative to that, Rodney, is when you look at quarter to date, we are essentially right on top of where our fourth quarter was. And the split between the core supermarket business and the alternative businesses is very similar to where the fourth quarter ended. I know there's a lot of rhetoric out there that the pull-forward of SNAP means that we've started the year out more slowly, but we're essentially right on top of where the fourth quarter ended so far here in the first quarter now. It's a 16-week quarter. A long way to go, but we are off to a start that helps us feel good about the guidance. 
W. McMullen: And Mike's point on SNAP, it definitely -- there was definitely a pull-forward. And when you look at SNAP by itself, the first period of the year would be a headwind. But if you look at other pieces... 
J. Schlotman: It would be a headwind, but we filled that headwind with other sales in the supermarkets. 
Gary Millerchip: Just maybe one other color to add too. As we think about the journey from Restock Kroger in '18, a lot of the initiatives that we landed during the year that created some of the noise that Mike referred, but really should start to build tailwinds into 2019. Rodney mentioned that the turning point from a profitability impact of digital. But as we continue to grow digital sales at the rates that we're seeing on a much bigger number, that continues to have a bigger influence as we head into the outer years of Restock Kroger on the ID sales performance of the business. And then the work that we did in 2018 to invest in our own brands and driving significantly high customer engagements as customers continue to deepen their relationship with our own brands is an important piece of the, I think, the opportunity that we see in 2019. And then finally, the merger with Home Chef and the work we're doing to expand the fresh food experience in the store and the meal kits opportunity obviously only came in partway through the year and represents another opportunity that we see to really build momentum in '19 from '18. 
Paul Trussell: That's helpful color. And somewhat related, I'm curious what you're seeing over the past few months and what you're forecasting ahead on the inflation front. And if you could just kind of comment a bit more on how we should think about price points given higher input costs? Are you seeing price points go higher? And also to what extent -- or how would you describe kind of the price environment out there? Is the environment rational? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't know if I'll get -- if I'll grade the environment to rational or irrational. This is a competitive industry. It's always been a competitive industry, and we always build a business plan assuming it's going to be a little bit more competitive versus less competitive. And if we get surprised and it's not more competitive, it winds up being a help. If you think about inflation just in the fourth quarter and you take out fuel and pharmacy, cost inflation was less than that. It was about 39 basis points. When you add in pharmacy, it kicked up to 1.08 basis points. For the year, it's actually without pharmacy was slight deflation on the year from a cost basis, which is -- may not reconcile with everything you're hearing about cost increases coming through. Our team's done a phenomenal job of going after cost of goods savings in a variety of ways. And keep in mind, the numbers I'm talking about is what we pay for products based on how many of those units we have this year and last year and the price this year and last year. So we've done a great job of being able to offset some of those cost increases you hear about. 
W. McMullen: The other thing that I would add, and we talked about this before, but when you look at some of the companies, they've raised prices more than what the true cost is. And it's -- it really helps that our own brands are so strong because what we find is when somebody does that, they end up giving up market share and they give up market share to our own brands. And over time, we make more profit on Our Brands than we do selling the national brands. Now we're going to always give the customer choice and we want to earn whatever we get. But if somebody's pushing costs through more, they will end up giving up share when they do that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: Can we just start off again with 2019 guidance here? How much of this $100 million to $200 million EBIT growth is essentially going to be coming from your core grocery versus your alternative revenue streams? And how are you thinking about the fuel margin in 2019? And then I suppose, Mike, I can certainly understand that you don't want to go line for line on guidance. But clearly, the market is reacting to the negative 93 basis point gross margin results. So maybe just at the very least, you could hold our hands a little bit going into the first half of the year on gross margins and how to think about that as alternative revenues become a greater component of your EBIT. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I understand your request to hold your hand a little bit, but we're going to stick with the guidance we've given and not get specific on gross margins and things like that. I would say a big chunk of the growth in operating profit margin for next year would be coming from the core business with ID sales like we talked about. We do expect, as I said, fuel to be a pretty dramatic headwind next year, which leads us to the bottom line result of the guidance Gary talked about in his section. 
W. McMullen: On fuel, we would be pretty close to using our 3-year average on margin in terms of expectations of fuel. We do skew that a little bit to more recent times, but it's pretty close to the 3-year average. On gross margin, you should not expect a 93 basis point reduction in gross margin. 
J. Schlotman: That I agree with. 
W. McMullen: And if you look at the model overall, as you know, we've accelerated a lot of the investments. And some of the things showing up in [ gross ] is just the way the accounting shows in terms of warehouse and transportation cost. So those types of things, we would not expect that same headwind. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. So I suppose my quick follow-up to that just really is, we were expecting to see far less than 93 basis points in Q4 based on Q3 comments. So just to be clear, so long as we don't receive any type of material tailwind from fuel, which we are very unlikely to receive in Q1, there should be some sequential improvement in your gross margin degradation, correct? 
J. Schlotman: Correct. 
Chris  Mandeville: And then my follow-up would be, just I've spent quite a bit of time in Vegas these last couple of days at Shop Talk. We've been speaking to a lot of folks within micro fulfillment. So Rodney, I guess, I just want to get your take here again as it relates to the relationship with Ocado. Can you help us think about a few items here and just why you think this is the right technology going forward? Have you spoken to them with respect to their own micro fulfillment option -- called Zoom? And then maybe does that actually afford you some flexibility with respect to the 20 CFCs that you dedicated yourself to with them? 
W. McMullen: In terms of -- first of all, somebody on the Ocado team and the Kroger team would -- actually would be talking daily. Now if you look on a broader strategic conversation, those would be happening probably on the monthly type basis. The thing -- one of the reasons that we were incredibly excited about partnering with Ocado is Tim and his team continually push themselves. And what they have today, they'll continue to get better and they'll continue to give a look at different approaches and alternatives. And when we signed an agreement with Tim, one of the comments we made was that we're not signing it based on what you have today, we're signing it based on what we think you're going to have in 3 to 5 years because of the talent they have, their drive to keep getting better and some of the things they have on their drawing board. So I feel very comfortable that if there's a model out there that's more efficient and gives the customer what they want, the partnership with Ocado, we'll be able to discover that and we'll be there when it needs to be there as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: Mike, gosh, it's been years. So congratulations. I can't believe you're going to be not on the call. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. My 77th one, as I said. 
Scott Mushkin: Yes. I don't think I've done 77, but I've done a few myself. So congratulations. 
J. Schlotman: Some days, it feels like you've done more than that, Scott. 
Scott Mushkin: So market share. You guys usually ran through market share in the fourth quarter, and I was just wondering if you can give us some thoughts on what's happened with the market share during the year. And then I wanted to follow-up. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you think about market share the way it's traditionally calculated, our market share did grow in the year. As Rodney talked about, our tonnage was actually better than what our ID sales were. And as you invest in price and things like that, it can distort the top line, but you're moving -- you continue to grow tonnage. 
W. McMullen: But it did slightly improve for the year. 
Scott Mushkin: Market share? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. 
Scott Mushkin: And when you're talking tonnage when we look at the IDs, you're excluding about 50 basis points from specialty pharma contribution. Is that correct or no? 
J. Schlotman: Let me understand you. I don't understand your question exactly. 
Scott Mushkin: I thought you put specialty pharma into the comp. And I forget what quarter you did that -- it was the first quarter of last year and I was just wondering... 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we started at the beginning of the year. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On tonnage, what we tried to do is just look at the absolute number of units that's flowing through our stores. So a unit of toilet paper counts as 1 whether it's a 1 pack or a club pack size. But it's just looking at the units that are flowing through our stores is how we try to track it. 
Scott Mushkin: Perfect. And my follow-up question is, I know you guys have been working on alternative revenues for a while. So I assume in the '18 numbers there's a chunk of that EBIT that's alternative revenues. I was just wondering if you can size how big the year-over-year gain was and how big the alternative revenues are already. 
Gary Millerchip: Yes. I think as we mentioned a few minutes ago, we saw really nice growth in alternative profits year over year. The 2 biggest areas, as you know, from the analyst meeting, are media and Kroger Personal Finance. And both of those 2 grew profitability by over 20% during 2018. As I kind of referred to earlier, we're still really wanting to work through what's the best way to be able to give you the full picture around alternative profit going forward. It's becoming obviously a bigger and more meaningful part of our business. As Mike mentioned, Mike Schlotman mentioned earlier, with the fuel being a headwind in 2019, we expect both what you traditionally think of as the core business an alternative profits both to be contributing to the improvements in FIFO operating profit in 2019 with a headwind that we'll face in fuel. But at this point, we're really taking a step back and determining what's the best way to really share the alternative profit story in a meaningful way for all of you and to make sure that we can connect the dots for everybody. 
J. Schlotman: And if you remember back at the investor conference this year in '18, Stuart Aitken had a slide that showed the slope of the growth of alternative profit. Admittedly, it didn't have the dollars on it. But if you take a look at that slide, it shows how we expect it to continue to build over time. And as that momentum starts, you'll see even more growth out into the future. 
Operator: And next question will come from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. 
Gregory Badishkanian: Great. So just a follow-up on the food inflation. You had mentioned it was 39 basis points. So I'm just wondering how much -- how'd you expect that to trend in 2019? And also, just your ability to pass that amount or even maybe greater than that in terms of [ to the ] customer? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, our expectation for inflation in 2019 is relatively benign. And I would say the way it gets passed on depends a lot about where the inflation comes from. Is it in a category where we have a specific pricing program that we want to stay committed to. Or is it in a -- or in a category where it might be a little easier to pass on and others are passing on along -- passing it on along as well. So it really depends exactly where you wind up seeing the inflation, whether or not it gets passed along and how quickly it gets passed along. 
Gregory Badishkanian: Right. Makes sense. And then just with the -- a lot of discussion on the press -- in the press about Amazon opening up physical stores, how would you characterize the level of risk to larger conventional food retailers from that move? And what are kind of the things that are maybe embedded in terms of your competitive positioning and your footprint that would help to offset that? 
W. McMullen: Well, a couple of things. First of all, as you know, we embarked upon creating an omnichannel experience for our customers of almost 5 years ago now. And we're -- if you look at the feedback our customers give us, we're increasingly being able to help it -- help the customer make it easier for them to get they want. And what we find is when customers are engaged digitally, they still come into the physical store and they also spend more with us in total. So our teams have done a great job of being able to create that and make sure that we keep that customer connection and continuing to improve that customer connection. The thing that we've had for years is we have 460,000 associates out there that are just every day working hard to serve our customers and each other. The quality of our fresh product continues to get better and better and it's a competitive advantage. When you take all of those things together, and we have a lot of great physical locations that are high-quality sites that have been accumulated over several years. It's really all of those things together in terms of what will cause the customer to want to come from us, partner with us and for us to be able to give them an experience they can't get somewhere else. And very excited about where we are. And as Gary mentioned in the prepared remarks, from a digital standpoint, we would expect that to become a tailwind in 2019. Thanks, Greg, appreciate it.
 As always, thank you for everyone's call. As I mentioned at the beginning, we understand and acknowledge that we have our work cut out for us, and the market showed it this morning. But I want to emphasize that we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call also is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insight on our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well.
 So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few comments directed toward them. As I mentioned earlier in our prepared remarks, Kroger believes in strengthening the communities where we do business, within our supply chain, across our communities and in our stores. And you don't have to look far to see how much that strength comes from women. This month, we're excited to recognize all the women across Kroger -- the Kroger enterprise, who work day in and day out to exemplify our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Kroger employs more than 250,000 women who work in our stores, manufacturing and distribution plants and offices. A growing number of nearly 500 women-owned businesses here in the U.S. are Kroger suppliers. And through our commitment to source foods that are Fair Trade Certified as part of our Simple Truth product line, we are proud to support women-owned cooperatives and businesses internationally, including women-led tea farms in Rwanda. Kroger is proud to join in today's celebration of International Women's Day, and we are lighting up our headquarters building in Cincinnati tomorrow to celebrate. 
 Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every year -- every day of every year. I also want to have one last thank you for Mike, 77 calls is a heck of a lot of calls. Mike has been a great friend and partner in this journey. And Gary, congratulations. I'm incredibly looking forward to working with you and for you to be able to build on the things that Mike has put in place in working with his team. So congratulations. 
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2018-12-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 At our Investor Conference at the end of October, we shared several big ideas. The defining idea is that we are transforming our business model through Restock Kroger and then beyond. We will grow market share by both redefining Kroger customer experience and alternative profit streams through complementary businesses and partnerships.
 Redefining the customer experience means offering customers incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering and friendly and caring associates. Delivering an exceptional customer experience through the Kroger ecosystem creates incremental new profit streams, which in turn drives the economic model that makes the seamless experience possible. 
 In this way, our new growth model will be a virtuous cycle. This all means that Kroger is also reinventing our financial model. We're moving from a traditional grocer to a growth company with both a strong customer ecosystem that offers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere and asset-light, high-margin alternative partnerships and services. I will break it down a bit in more detail. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top-line.
 At our Investor Conference, we highlighted one of the most successful to date, Kroger Personal Finance as well as several businesses under our 84.51° portfolio, including our Kroger Precision Marketing media offering. Kroger Personal Finance delivered record year-to-date profit and is on track for their most profitable year ever. Our high-margin media business is strong and growing. Revenue for Kroger Precision Marketing, Powered by 84.51°, is up more than 150% year-to-date. 
 One service line, our boosted products and search business, where advertisers can influence how their products show up on our sites, benefited advertisers with more than 700 million product impressions in the third quarter alone, personalized to Kroger shoppers, with click to conversion rates that are 2 to 3x the industry standard. 
 We see tremendous potential in these asset-light, margin-rich businesses build off of a robust grocery supermarket experience, which is being redefined every day at Kroger. Nowhere is this more obvious than digital. Our digital sales grew by over 60% in the third quarter. Our seamless coverage area now reaches more than 90% of Kroger households. This includes Kroger Pickup and Delivery. 
 Kroger Ship is now available in all supermarket divisions. Ship customers can shop from a curated selection informed by 84.51° data and insights of more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter the most to our customers, plus there are 4,500 Our Brand products available only from Kroger. We are aggressively investing to build digital platforms because they give our customers the ability to have Anything, Anytime, Anywhere from Kroger and because they're our catalysts to grow our business and improve margins in the future. 
 As we stated at our Investor Day, we expect to be able to cover not only 100% of our customers but also the entire U.S. population. Our Brands continue to perform exceptionally well with customers and is one of the most profitable parts of our supermarket business. Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.6% of sales dollars, both of which are record third quarter results. 
 Our Private Selection and Simple Truth brands saw strong sales, units and gross margin gains in the third quarter. Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic is our fastest growing brand, with sales up double digits, again, in this third quarter. As we've shared previously, Our Brands account for 4 of the top 5 items sold through Kroger Pickup, and 41 of the top 50 items sold on Kroger Ship.
 We have now been executing for 3 quarters our Restock Kroger Plan to create shareholder value by redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value, developing talent and living our purpose. We feel good about the progress and how everything is coming together. We are proactively investing for the future in stores and online and in our customers and associates. We are using our assets, especially our love of people and our love of food, to transform our business in ways that drive sustainable competitive advantage.
 Now here is Mike to share more details on our third quarter results and to update you on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our net adjusted operating earnings per diluted share result of $0.48 for the third quarter. Strong fuel margins and continued execution of Restock Kroger contributed to this result. We continue to make several Restock Kroger investments in the third quarter. These included investments in price, especially in support of Our Brands and in space optimization, store remodels and technology enhancements.
 Part of these investments will allow customers to buy Anything, Anytime, Anywhere from Kroger. As we discussed at our Investor Conference, space optimization is a massive undertaking, and we continue to expect to end the year with 600 stores completed. Our ID sales for the third quarter were in line with our expectation. ID sales were led by natural foods, pharmacy, seafood, produce and deli departments.
 Looking at gross margin. We were pleased to see that our shrink rate continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the previous year. The gross margin rate reflects the timing and size of company's price investments compared to a year ago, rising transportation costs and growth of the specialty pharmacy business, which is a high-sales, low-margin rate business that generates strong gross profit dollars. 
 Keep in mind that last year in the third quarter, our gross margin rate was higher than our typical run rate. For the third quarter in 2018, gross margin, excluding fuel, was actually higher than the second quarter of 2018. These fluctuations illustrate how results in a given quarter can vary based on the cadence of the investments we make in the business.
 Part of our investments this year support the Our Brand strategy where we continue to offer high-quality products at a great value. The improvement in unit movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers. We intended to continue investing in price to drive unit growth while also delivering on the bottom-line for our shareholders.
 We are pleased that OG&A costs decreased by 20- basis points as a rate of sales. The significant improvements we are seeing from our focus on reducing store associate turnover is contributing to this positive movement. We continue to focus on productivity and waste and improvements in our cost to fill prescriptions and increased adoption of self-scan contributed to this improvement. Our investments in Restock Kroger in redefining the customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This will contribute to generating $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020.
 Now for an update on our fuel -- retail fuel performance during the third quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.261 compared to $0.249 in last year's third quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.81 compared to $2.46 in the same quarter last year. We expect our tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 23%. Excluding the 2018 adjustment items, Kroger expects its tax rate to be approximately 21%. These rates reflect the third quarter adjustment related to a regular IRS audit. The IRS audit resulted in a reduction in prior year tax deductions at pretax reform rates and future tax deductions at post-tax reform rates.
 Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to invest the combined $589 million in Ocado securities and Home Chef; contribute an incremental $185 million pretax through a company-sponsored pension plan; $467 million to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund; repurchase 91 million common shares for $2.3 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under an accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid $435 million in dividends and we invested $3 billion in capital, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.
 We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of Restock free cash flow by 2020 as part of our Restock Kroger Plan. We have working capital improvements built into this guidance and off to a great start with $100 million improvement in net operating capital -- net operating working capital, so far, this year. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.72. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target is 2.3 to 2.5x, and we remain committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range.
 We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. 
 In March, we also announced investing a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program, Feed Your Future, and an increased 401(k) match for nonunion associates. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering more than 13,000 Kroger associates in Columbus, Ohio. The agreement raises starting wages and accelerates wage progressions after 1 year of service. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland.
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solvent wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. 
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, in the second half to be similar to the first half results. We updated our GAAP net earning guidance to $3.80 to $3.95 per diluted share for 2013 (sic) [ 2018 ] from the previous range of $3.88 to $4.03. The change in GAAP guidance is due to the third quarter market value adjustment of $0.09 per diluted share for Kroger's investment in Ocado shares and does not reflect any future changes in the market value of those shares because those cannot be predicted.
 On an adjusted basis, we maintained our net operating earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018, and keep in mind that fiscal 2017 included an extra week. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. 
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We're not quite through our first year of executing Restock Kroger, and we feel great about where we are. We are laser-focused on our customers and fulfilling their needs. We are clear on our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Our 2018 accomplishments and investments set us up well for 2019, and we are committed to delivering on our Restock Kroger financial targets by the end of 2020. We have a clear path through both redefining the customer experience and growing alternative profit streams. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: I just wanted to ask a bit further on the alternative revenue streams. Since your guy's Investor Day, we, on the phone, of course, have been getting a lot of questions from investors as well around that. You called out today kind of the Kroger Personal Finance seeing nice results there, but can you just kind of give us a little bit more color on that specifically? And just kind of as a category alternative revenue streams, kind of what are some of the puts and takes? We know it's one of the more important components of your EBIT guide. 
W. McMullen: If you look at the October meeting, we went through several different ones. Obviously, today, if you look at -- we highlighted Kroger Personal Finance in October because we wanted everybody to see that we actually have a great track record of delivering against identifying new business opportunities and having it grow in a meaningful way that's actually substantial to us. One of the announcements that we made last year was the Kroger Precision Marketing where we're using the insights from 84.51°. All of those things are really based on the traffic from our stores and our digital properties in creating a seamless experience for customers. And all of those things that we're doing will help our customers shop one of our stores easier. And, like in the media experience, it will allow our CPG partners and other people to target specific customers through our pipeline. If you look at over the last 4 years, the compounded annual growth from a profitability standpoint has been 16%. If you look at our expectations as you look at '18 through '20, we would expect that to accelerate to 28% growth per year. And certainly, the progress that we're having in '18 would support the 16% that we projected based on the historical 4 years. Mike, anything you want to add? 
J. Schlotman: No. I think we also -- Rodney gave some color on the Kroger Precision Marketing. The fact that it's up 150% year-to-date and I think it's pretty impressive that the boosted search of relatively new product with 700 million product impressions just this third quarter. And when you get click-to-conversion ratios 2 to 3x industry standard, that's the kind of thing that keeps that momentum going and keeps third parties interested in continuing to have that boosted search. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. All right. That's helpful color. And then maybe just as a -- maybe a SaaS follow-up, just in the press release this morning, just with some of that price investment commentary, is that -- would you say kind of normal cadence, nothing out of kind of the ordinary? Or did you see any particular changes on the competitive front or by category this quarter? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I would say it was just -- if you look at the overall strategy, it's executing the overall strategy that we started -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year but we've been embarking upon for several years. So I wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary. As Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, last year's third quarter was higher than trend-line. The other thing, I think, that's important just to note is that we did have a couple new warehouses starting up and a warehouse conversion that also negatively affected the margins in the quarter. And those are one-time -- well, it will take a couple of quarters for those to get started up in the transition, but that also negatively affected the quarter. 
Operator: The next question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: So I just wanted to ask a question about full year guidance and the implied fourth quarter. So the range is pretty wide for 4Q getting kind of like $0.38 to $0.53. So I'm wondering if you could just give a little color on that and the puts-and-takes to operating margin. And then, I guess, maybe comment on the guidance in light of the fact that gas margins seemed pretty strong in the quarter-to-date. And I know in the past when that has been the case, you've pulled forward expenses into the fourth quarter or into the quarter -- whatever the quarter was where there were strong gas margins, so a little color there would be helpful. 
J. Schlotman: Sure, Karen. And the wide range, I -- we all agree here at Kroger that the range for the fourth quarter is quite wide, keeping it at $0.15. And it's purely driven by what you zeroed in on, and that's gasoline margins and where they wind up because they've been very volatile over the last several weeks, while a very strong year, they can turn pretty quickly both positively and negatively. And if you think about what one margin in gallon means to earnings per share or $0.01 margin per gallon means to earnings per share, it can equate to almost $0.01 a share. That volatility is what caused us to decide to keep the range fairly wide. It has nothing to do with our view of how the business is going to operate in the fourth quarter. It's purely, will margins continue to be strong? Will they get weak the next -- will they get weaker the next 5 or 6 weeks or where exactly will they go. And it's really, you're unable to predict where those margins go on a weekly basis so we just decided to keep it a little wider purely based on where gas margins may wind up in the fourth quarter. 
Karen Short: Okay. So is it fair to think though if they remain strong, you'll pull expenses into the fourth quarter? Or it's just impossible to predict? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't necessarily predict pulling expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at where we're sitting here in early December, our promotional activity and our ads are pretty well set, how we plan to go to market over the holidays coming up and New Year's and even as we get into later January getting ready for the college football playoffs and the Super Bowl, all those big events. Those kinds of plans are pretty well locked and loaded and the supply chain is ready for those kinds of activities to come through. So to do a lot of other unusual things in the next, call it, 8 weeks, 8.5 weeks would be -- I think we're pretty comfortable with the plans we have in place. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then just a general question on the alternative revenue streams. I mean, presumably, those are high-gross margin and this quarter isn't really the quarter to see the flow-through, obviously, given the comparisons from last year, but gross margins were still a little lower than we were modeling. But any color on how to think about how alternative revenue streams will impact reported gross margin ex fuel going forward? 
W. McMullen: The -- I wouldn't -- longer term, I wouldn't say that we're really to a position to start giving some of the detailed insights. Your hypothesis is absolutely correct in terms of the margins in our alternative profit streams are significantly higher than the core business, which is one of the reasons why we want to make sure that we call it out and point it out. The other thing, as you know, that's incredibly important is in those -- in that space, it's typically very asset light. So if you look at Kroger Personal Finance, we have an incredibly strong partnership with the bank. The assets that's used to grow that business is reasonably modest. If you look at Kroger Precision Marketing, it's using insights and data to create that revenue stream so it's easily scalable as long as you're producing the results for your customers. So it's a piece that's incredibly exciting. In terms of giving some specifics, I just think it's still a little too early for that. 
Operator: The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Can we start with just IDs? Could you maybe talk about the cadence of the IDs throughout the quarter? What you're seeing so far in the current quarter? And any update on the optimization drag? I think, obviously, your guidance implies Q4 will be better. I'm just curious as to whether you're seeing some of that yet. 
J. Schlotman: Well, if you look at the cadence throughout the quarter, it was fairly consistent throughout the quarter. As you look at so far this quarter, we would be in the same range as where we ended the third quarter, so we've started off at about the same spot. When you look at space optimization and the fact that we're in the holiday season, we've been disciplined to not have stores disrupted during the holiday season, so we would expect to have those stores start to perform better like we talked about at the Investor Conference. We will start up next year -- space ops. We will start some stores in January after the holiday season. When you think about the slide I showed at the Investor Conference on space op, what we're seeing in ID sales for those stores is not materially different than what I showed back in October. 
Edward Kelly: All right. And then I wanted to ask you about SG&A. It was a positive surprise this quarter, for sure. Can you talk about your ability to drive 20- basis points of OpEx leverage this quarter? And you've been talking about cost discipline, right? Is this now starting to inflect into the P&L? And I'm just kind of curious as we think about things going forward, how we should be thinking about this line item? How important is it to your $400 million over time? Just any color there would be good in terms of like what this quarter means as to how we think about modeling going forward. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I think what it means is a lot of what you said, and when you look at the areas that I called out in the prepared comments, when you think about retention, and our retention getting significantly better than it has, it does multiple things. One, you don't spend the dollars you have to spend to hire somebody, just the actual hard cost of getting somebody into the system whether you do a background check or any kinds of other screenings on the individual, getting them through a training program and then getting them on to the sales floor, at a productivity level lower than someone who has 6 or 9 months experience. So when you have more and more people who have that 6 to 9 months experience and start to get to the 12 months experience, that helps the productivity inside the store. More people then wind up staying, particularly the part-time workforce, as they start to understand and appreciate, when they're here 6 months, they start to get the benefit of Feed Your Future where they can get $3,500 a year towards furthering their education. That cost, while it sounds expensive, actually will be offset by that person staying for another 12 or 18 months versus having that person turn a couple of times and having lower productivity and training. So you kind of create a virtuous cycle and better opening wage rates, more contemporary benefits, helping them with their college education or GED or English as a second language. We have a lot of folks here work for Kroger in management positions that have decided to go back and get their MBA and other advanced degree certification. So all of those together help with that. We continue to see improvements in our cost to filling our pharmacies. Our pharmacy business continues to be a very strong piece. Our script count on a 30-day adjusted basis continues to grow nicely. And as we leverage that and are able to leverage down our cost to fill prescriptions, that certainly helps. And then the efforts we've had both on our front-end transformation that we tried to work in with space op, when possible, of reconfiguring the self-checkout units so that it's an easier, a more friendly experience for our customers. And then the added benefit of the Scan, Bag and Go, all of those help create productivity, which is a positive to it. A lot of things I said there. I don't know that I would promise 20- basis points going forward, but certainly cost reduction as we've been talking since we announced Restock Kroger on October '17 is a very important part of getting the $400 million of operating profit. 
W. McMullen: I agree totally with everything that Mike said. And I think the last part that Mike said is the important part. As you look at now through 2020, you should expect to see us reducing cost of -- how much cost it takes us to operate our business. And Mike gave a bunch -- several great examples, but we're really -- our operations team is doing a great job working with our stores and our technology team on some innovation ideas to improve processes and take cost out. So it's really all of those pieces working together. But absolutely, as you look out through 2020, you should expect us to improve cost and how much it costs us to operate our business. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: In light of the fact that space optimization disruption should be a little less in the fourth quarter plus given the re-acceleration of your price investments, should we expect that IDs are going to meaningfully accelerate in the subsequent months over your fourth quarter? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I think that the only place that would go on -- ID sales is our guidance as we expect the second half to be comparable to the first half. Our third quarter was close to the second quarter and our first quarter was a little better than the second quarter. So we do have a little bit of ground to make up on that guidance, but we didn't -- we said similar, we didn't say exactly equal to. But we are expecting a little bit better fourth quarter. We're working hard to do that. I think we have great plans in place. 
Michael Lasser: And Mike, what would be the offset to some of those benefits? Are there industry factors, consumer pressures? What are your thoughts there? 
J. Schlotman: I don't know what you mean by offset. 
Michael Lasser: Because you're going to see less disruption from space optimization and you should get a sales lift from the price investments that you've been making, so I'm just wondering if there's offsetting drags to those factors. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't point to any particular offsetting drag as it relates to the top-line. Keep in mind, our fuel rewards program continues to be incredibly important to our customers and our associates when they think about the total value that we give them on a day in, day out basis. And that $0.10 a gallon they get off, keep in mind, we reduce reported IDs for that because you have to buy groceries to get the lower fuel discount. Not all of our competitors account for it that way. So as that continues to be popular and more and more people engage in that, we're selling more in the stores, but it actually slows how quickly ID sales grow just because of the way we do our accounting. So there are always puts-and-takes on that top line. 
Michael Lasser: That's helpful. And my follow-up question is on Kroger Personal Finance. It's been seeing very healthy growth. What's been driving that? And how much of that is the private label credit card? 
W. McMullen: It's really all of the portfolio of products they offer. So in the last 2 or 3 years, we've done a couple of mergers with Roundy's and Harris Teeter so there's good growth there. There's good growth in the existing business. And then the credit card business continues to be an incredible tie-in for -- loyalty for Kroger customers, so it's really all pieces of that business continues to grow. Obviously, credit write-offs are low as well, but that' a pretty small part of the overall impact on the profitability of that business. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: In the past, around this time of year, you've provided some initial thoughts about the upcoming fiscal year, at least, on some occasions. Mike, at the Investor Day, you did say, I think, 2019 has to have some, I think, the word you used was decent operating profit margin dollars. I just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you're expecting next year? Or in general for next year, are there any unique tailwinds, headwinds we should be thinking about? Just opening up that topic if we can. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't go too far on 2019, but it's -- if you go all the way back to 2017 and then the first quarter of this year, when we talked about pulling forward some investments from '19 into '18, clearly, operating profit margin has to grow in 2019 over 2018 and start that march to the $400 million that we're going to generate over the 3 years of the Restock Kroger Plan. I will say, and I knew at some point we would get this question because we were a little -- we were pretty more prescriptive this time last year on the call about what we expected for 2018, and a lot of that had to do with the fact that we had a range of estimates out there at that point in time that were as low as in the $1.40s and $1.50s and up to above $2.20 kind of range. It was a massive range. And what we were trying to do was rein in that range as we got into the end of the year. And knowing that we were going to give guidance in March, we didn't want that wide of a range out there. I think, today, people are understanding that this is a 3-year program we're undertaking. And as we make -- as we pull those investments from '19 into '18, they should start generating a little bit more in '19, then even more in '20. So it is a 3-year growth of algorithm to get to the $400 million where we continue to see a clear path to the $400 million. 
W. McMullen: The other point that I would add, and we talked about it in October, is if you look at digital, our overall digital business continues to be a significant investment for the future of the business. And we would expect for '19, that to become a less of a headwind that it was in '18. And that is also an important part to remember as well. 
Kenneth Goldman: And then a follow-up. If I look at your SG&A dollars and -- they were down year-on-year if I exclude the one-time pension contribution last year, some extra weeks, it actually was down for the first time in at least 22 years according to my model. So I realize you're gaining efficiencies in store associates, I get that Personal Finance is a contrast SG&A item, but I'm still not 100% sure why that decline was so sudden. I mean, your SG&A came in $200 million below where The Street was. So can you help us understand a little bit of what the big dramatic change was in the quarter or maybe I'm just -- we're all just modeling it wrong and didn't see something. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. From a dollar standpoint, Ken, don't forget that last year would have had the C-stores in our OG&A rate and they're disposed of now in our dollars. 
Kenneth Goldman: Yes. But last quarter, in 2Q, it was still -- you still were up year-on-year with SG&A, so it was a little bit more of a dramatic change. I could follow it up off-line if it's -- I don't want to hold everyone up on the call. 
J. Schlotman: Hold on one second. 
W. McMullen: Ken, they're pulling up stuff to talk. 
Kenneth Goldman: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do this. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We were up a little bit in the second quarter. I would say the second quarter is probably more a function of, in the prior year, we would have had some bonus accrual reductions because of the year it was at -- where the year was heading that we didn't enjoy this year. 
Operator: The next question will come from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: So as it was noted, you guys are doing quite well in OG&A but gross margins were a bit lower than what we were all expecting. Mike, can you just maybe help ballpark the impact on gross margins based on the noted items that you called out? And I know you don't necessarily like to guide to any one line item, but just given the particular strength in fuel margins that we're seeing quarter-to-date and how that plays into overall earnings, can you give us a sense of just how to think about gross margins ex fuel in Q4? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you think about that margin rate in Q4, I'm more comfortable doing that than listing out the effects in any one quarter of some of those things because 1 quarter is not an indication of where they go long term. The one I did call out is Kroger Specialty Pharmacy. It's a very profitable business. It has a very low margin rate. But because of the individual cost of those prescriptions for the patients, it generates very strong gross margin dollars which is why we're in that business. And as that business continues to grow, it will be a headwind. That one alone was a double-digit basis point headwind, but I won't give the exact amount. When you think about the fourth quarter, you should probably think about the fourth quarter change in gross margin rate the way we talk about that basis point change being more similar to the second quarter than the third quarter. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up. Over the last couple of weeks now, we've seen several sizable product recalls. And I think some of it was even specific to the Kroger brand in both meats and pet food. So I'm just curious on what Kroger has been doing of late or what it plans to do when it comes to supply chain and improving sourcing helping mitigate recall costs. 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look, food safety has been something that Kroger has been incredibly proud of for many, many years. And we have a team of folks here that, that is their only responsibility is to make sure that products are safe throughout the food channel. We will do routine audits of our suppliers as part of that process. One of the things that we are incredibly proud of is, in the unfortunate situation where there is a recall, we reach out to our customers and let them know that there's a recall on products they bought so that we try to get that customer to get the product back to us as quick as possible to make it easy on them and to let them know. It's something that we also review with our board on a regular basis. If you look at severity of incidents, we've actually, over the last 5 or 6 years, there's been a decline on severe incidents. Now if you look at overall recalls, it continues to increase just because I think the overall food safety chain in the U.S. continues to improve. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And maybe just 2 quick housekeeping questions. What was inflation, deflation in the quarter? And was there any notable call-out from hurricane impacts on the comp or expenses in the... 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you look at the hurricane impacts, it would have been a little bit of a headwind to ID sales. We didn't necessarily call it out primarily because it wasn't that dramatic, but it was several basis points of a headwind. More than a couple, but it's not like it was 20- or 30- basis points. So -- but it was meaningful, but not directionally going to change the answer. If you look at your question on inflation, deflation, I'm looking at my chart here. I have 30-year-olds that make a chart for their eyes, not my eyes. So if you look at inflation, deflation without fuel and pharmacy, on a cost basis, we had about 11- basis points of inflation. If you put pharmacy back into the mix, we had about 22- basis points of inflation. So a very benign environment. It ranges around the categories of who had some inflation and deflation, and there were some categories that had a little bit of inflation and others that had a fair amount of deflation. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So on capital allocation, I was curious how quickly you anticipate being back to that 2.3 to 2.5x leverage ratio. And then as we look out to next year, I know you have $1 billion term loan coming due. So just curious if you have any initial thoughts in terms of whether you would pay that down or refinance that debt. 
J. Schlotman: So we actually have about $1.1 billion of long-term debt that is now classified as current coming due in, call it, the next 90 days -- or next 60 days. Some this month, some next month that we would anticipate refinancing that in the market. We do have forward -- we have forward starting swaps against both of the types of debt we would wind up expecting to issue at very favorable rates. The 30-years hedge is almost 100- basis points below where the 30-year is today, and the 10-years hedge is not quite that strongly but almost as strongly. We haven't decided exactly what we'll do with the term loan. It is -- some of our banks like the business, some don't like the business, but we certainly would have enough capacity with commercial paper to be able to use commercial paper to pay off the term loan if we chose to. So we'll have -- we always have a financial policy committee meeting with our board in January and we'll discuss our plans of how much flexibility do we want. If we rolled over the term loan, it keeps more revolver capacity so you can handle fluctuations day-to-day. Relative to the net total debt-to-EBITDA range, we are always in contact with the rating agencies. They understand what our program is and we are executing against the program we've described to them relative to them keeping our ratings where they are. 
W. McMullen: And it's important for us to get back into the range. 
J. Schlotman: Absolutely. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then switching topics on price investments, so they clearly accelerated, I think, the past quarter or 2. So just curious in terms of whether the volume uptick so far -- thus far -- is meeting your expectations. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't -- I don't know if I would be as strong in the comment that they clearly accelerated. If you go back to each of the quarters so far this year, we talked at the end of the first quarter that we started making the pull forward investments in the fourth quarter. So from that standpoint, what we were pulling forward from '19 into '18, it's a fair assessment that beginning then, we did make those pull forward investments. I wouldn't characterize the third quarter as a big uptick in what our price investments plans were for the year. It's just that we continue to make the price investments throughout the year and it's more a function of how we made price investments last year a little bit choppier than we did this year. 
Rupesh Parikh: And are they meeting your volume expectations as far as the volume uptick... 
J. Schlotman: So we continue to be happy with what we're seeing from the results of the plan. It's not a single plan. It's not a single investment. So as with anything, when you make price investments in a wide range of things, there are those out there that you probably are getting more volume than you expected and some, not quite as much. Not everyone is perfect, but we're constantly stepping back and assessing all the results. Overall, I would say we're very happy with what our investments are giving us. I don't want to give the appearance that each and every one of them is perfect because that probably wouldn't be believable, but we are very happy with the collection of them. And the ones that are doing well, we do more of. And the ones that aren't quite so well, we try to tweak and -- or see what else might work. 
Operator: The next question will come from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Just to follow up on the price investment first. Can you give us some insight to how internally the decisions are made around seeing better fuel profitability and kind of how quickly you can turn that in to pulled forward price investment. And then how should we think about that pull forward? Does it actually offset investments that you may have made next year? Or since the environment is so competitive, is there just this race to the bottom with everybody? 
J. Schlotman: I wouldn't -- it's obvious from some of the questions out there that there is this notion that when fuel profitability is very strong, we invest more in price and that's driving our gross margin down. I actually don't think that's true for this particular calendar year. We had a price program in place as part of Restock Kroger. We knew what we wanted to invest this year. Washington gave us a Tax Reform Act that lowered our cash taxes. We elected to pull some of our investments from '19 into '18 to get that expense behind us in the first year. The lower taxes start to drive better growth in those categories as we get into '19. I don't -- I wouldn't say that we've made any big moves on pricing as a result of strong fuel margins, it's just where everything shakes out. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing, I think it's always important to remember when we go to market, our fabulous associates in terms of the great experience they deliver in fresh product is also important. So for us, it's the overall shopping experience that we're trying to create for the customer. And we're aggressively investing in the Anything, Anytime, Anywhere so they can do it anyway they want to, whether that's digital, delivery, pickup or physically in a store and have the same great experience and great fresh product in all those together. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the OG&A line. I would say, historically, your unionization was thought of as kind of a knock on the business. And today, I would say that the expansion into online and digital is seen as needing incremental investment in OG&A. But would you say we're at a point where the unionization may be helping you in some ways, given the tightness of the labor environment? And is there anything you can do to dispel online grocery necessarily adding meaningfully to SG&A or bringing down the margin there? 
J. Schlotman: I think when you look at our workforce overall, whether you're unionized or nonunionized, when I look at -- because not 100% of Kroger is unionized. And when I look at overall results in a unionized market versus a non-unionized market, whether it's -- at the end of the day, the OG&A rate and what you pay associates to perform their jobs, when you look at your employee relations, employee satisfaction, there's really not a tremendous difference between those, particularly in the wages. But we offer all of our associates a great health care option and if they're in a union, they're in a more defined benefit plan. If they're not in the union, they would be -- some of them will be in a defined benefit plan, but some are in a defined contribution plan. So it's really a mix of benefits inside those. When I look at some of the home delivery and the online stuff that you refer to, there's a lot of cost in that system that everybody can point to and say how you're going to do it. It's one of the reasons we joined up with Ocado to build the fulfillment centers that we're going to start building, and we announced the first one here in Cincinnati. While there are certain costs that will add as a part of the total supply chain for the customer, there are other parts of that cost that will come out of the supply chain -- more efficient picking because it's done robotically, it's done significantly faster on a 50-item order compared to how long it takes a 50-item order inside the store. I don't take product from the manufacturer to the warehouse to the store. I take it from the manufacturer to the Ocado warehouse, and then it goes right from there to a customer. So there's different efficiencies which is, overall, why we think that's going to help offset some of the costs people are worried about. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: Could you speak to any additional color around your digital business? I know you mentioned up 60%. Just kind of what you're seeing out of Kroger Ship versus pickup and Home Chef. In addition, if you can maybe just speak to the new pilot with Walgreens. 
W. McMullen: There's a whole host of questions there, and I'll just... 
J. Schlotman: That was a good one question. 
W. McMullen: I'll try to organize it in a way that makes sense. As you mentioned, our digital business overall grew over 60%. All pieces of the digital business continues to grow. The -- if you look at what was the biggest drivers of the growth, it would certainly be continuing to add locations where customers can pick up and get delivery. From an online standpoint and the stores that were -- already had it a year ago, their continued growth, and then Home Chef as well. Home Chef would be pretty much exactly where we thought it would be from a growth standpoint or where Pat and his team thought they would be and then we were part of it. If you look at Ship and some of the other pieces, it's still pretty early in the process. We would have had a lot more expenses in terms of setting up where all the systems worked versus so much of a sales driver. But obviously, over time, you would expect that to become more of a sales driver, but that is very early in the ramp. The relationship with Walgreens, it's -- both of us are very excited about what it can be, but it's one of the things where you really have to start small and learn from it. And that's really the prioritization is let's take baby steps and see if we can identify something that works for a Walgreens customer and a Kroger customer in some way that both of us can grow our business and make money. So excited -- that thing, I guess, I'm most excited about is when I spend time with our combined teams and their openness and aggressiveness on trying to identify something that's great for our customers, for both of our customers, is the thing that's so exciting. But it's pretty early to be able to start giving some more specifics than that. 
Paul Trussell: I appreciate the color. And then just to quickly circle back on inflation or lack thereof. It's clearly a benign environment in terms of the impact to your third quarter results. I just wanted to just circle back on your outlook as you think about what's to come over the next few months. Any change in your outlook on inflation, deflation impact to your results? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say no. I don't really see a lot out there. I know there's a lot of noise in the marketplace about CPG companies pushing price increases through and the like. Over time, that -- we'll see where that goes and how everybody winds up reacting to it. Keep in mind, when we talk about inflation, deflation, it's relative to Kroger and not marketplace forces necessarily. So it's our cost of goods this year versus our cost of goods last year. And as everybody knows, a key component of driving the $400 million of operating profit over the next 3 years is continued improvement in cost of goods. So some of that deflation is actually doing things to get better pricing inside Kroger and that may not be something that's replicated at other places. 
W. McMullen: The other thing, I think, it's always important to remember is I always think it's a dangerous thing for CPGs to raise their cost more than what the economic cost of something increasing. And what we find, over time, when somebody does that, our own brands will pick up a disproportionate amount of share whenever somebody does that. So to me, it's a fine balance that we're all doing to try to find what's that optimal price point. 
Operator: And that final question will come from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Just a couple of quick ones. Sorry if I missed this. Mike, can you give us traffic versus ticket in the quarter? And maybe Rodney chime in, I'm just curious the tone of the customer through the quarter, were there any variances there? Are you seeing trade-up when you look at what they're doing? And then also, again, sorry if I missed this, but loyal households, is that -- was that still growing in 3Q similar to previous quarters? 
J. Schlotman: When you look at, overall, the basket value grew a little bit in the quarter, and that's primarily a result of mix of what's going inside the basket. When you look at transactions in the quarter, when you add in all of the entities, it was up a little bit in the quarter as well. 
W. McMullen: The tone of the customer, they continue to -- the economy still feels very good. People continue to buy wine, anything that makes their life easier, they will aggressively buy. So it wouldn't be anything -- and then from a household standpoint, we did continue to have a slight growth in households as well.
 We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them.
 Last week, we celebrated Giving Tuesday. In conjunction with our partner, Feeding America, we set a goal to raise enough money to provide 4 million meals to those in need during this holiday season. Together with our customers, we raised enough to serve almost 6 million meals, helping us move closer to our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste goal of eliminating hunger in our communities.
 Last Friday, a major earthquake rattled Alaska. We operate 7 Fred Meyer Stores that were affected. And thankfully, all of our associates and customers inside our stores were safe. I'm so proud of the awesome job that Fred Meyer and Kroger team did. Under the leadership of Joe Grieshaber and our teams, everybody worked together to get all our stores opened within 1 day. 
 Each holiday season, I'm reminded of our privilege to serve more than 9 million customers who shop with us every day. Every celebration or tradition is as unique as the customer who walks through our door. Among the hustle and bustle of the season, you welcome our customers and help to make their celebrations brighter. We lift our customers' spirits and they uplift our spirits as well. These are just a few examples of what it means to live our purpose to Feed the Human Spirit. It's an amazing thing of what we can do together.
 Thank you for all you do for our customers, communities and each other. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to you and your family and all those listening in. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2018-09-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Please save the date for our 2018 Investor Conference, which we will hold in Cincinnati on October 29 and 30. Details will be coming soon, and we hope you can join us. 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. 
 Restock Kroger is designed to reposition our core business by 2020 so we can achieve our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. We outlined the 4 main drivers of our plan last October: first, redefine the grocery customer experience; second, partner for customer value; third, develop talent; and fourth, live our purpose. Delivering on our objectives under each of these areas between now and 2020 will generate incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow to create shareholder value. And while we are only 2 quarters into our 3-year plan, we are making solid progress. 
 More importantly, I want to help you understand how all the steps we take today and in the future are set in motion with clear strategic intent in line with our vision. Everything we are doing is intended to create a truly seamless shopping experience so we can serve customers Anything, Anytime and Anywhere. As we create a seamless experience, we'll use our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers to be the hero to their families at mealtime every time. 
 You can see this through our exclusive arrangement to bring Ocado's smart platform to the U.S.; and in our recent launch of Ship, Kroger's new direct-to-customer shipping platform; and in our continued expansion of home delivery, including our driverless delivery tests with Nuro. You can also see this in our merger with Home Chef. Part of what makes our merger so exciting is their data-driven and customer-centered approach to menu creation and meal solution development. Home Chef is accelerating our ability to deliver convenience, simplicity and a personalized food experience. 
 We are also building an expansive network of innovative partnerships to create new customer value. Alternative revenue streams will expand and enhance our strong core business and increase profitability. Partnering with innovators like Ocado will both accelerate our core business and serve as the foundational platforms for new opportunities. 
 Our decision to launch our brands in the international markets through Alibaba's Tmall global platform is another example of our willingness to develop alternative revenue streams. And our people, generosity and passion for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste will make the world a better place. We are incredibly excited to see that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment earned Kroger a place among the top 10 companies on Fortune magazine's Change the World list. 
 You can see our vision coming into focus in several of the exciting announcements we've made over the last couple of months, and we're obviously not done. As we share more of these very intentional puzzle pieces with you in the months and years ahead, a very clear picture will emerge. Every one of these announcements is both a culmination of a new beginning and they are a culmination of the long focused strategic work by our teams, and they are the new beginning of the exciting innovations and growth platforms for the future. 
 Kroger's digital sales grew by over 50% in the second quarter. We're executing our digital strategy and growing our seamless coverage area, which now reaches more than 80% of our customers, up from 75% in the first quarter. This includes our network of ClickList pickup locations; stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners; and ship-to-home capabilities, such as our new Kroger Ship platform. 
 Kroger Ship launched in 4 markets in August: Cincinnati, Houston, Louisville and Nashville. We have since launched in Atlanta and anticipate rolling out the service to additional markets over the next few months. During this first phase of Ship, customers can shop from a curated selection of over 4,500 Our Brand products, which are not available anywhere else online, and more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter most to our customers, a list informed by the 84.51° data and insights. 
 Executing our strategy and innovating in our core business requires tremendous digital and technology talent. I'm pleased to share that this summer, Kroger Technology was named one of the Best Places to Work in IT by Computerworld magazine. Also this summer, we announced Kroger is establishing a new digital headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. In the city alone, we expect to grow the digital team from about 600 today to over 1,000 people by 2020. Then in August, we signed an agreement with the University of Cincinnati to operate an innovation lab within the school's new Innovation Hub, creating another talent pipeline to support our business. 
 All the changes we are making to build digital platforms will also create opportunities to grow our business and improve margins in the future. We are aggressively investing in these transformational opportunities. And while we are investing for the future, we are delivering for customers and shareholders today. 
 Our Brands continue to resonate with customers, both in-store and online. Since August launch of Kroger Ship, 41 of the top 50 items sold are Our Brand, and 4 of the top 5 items on ClickList are Our Brands. In the center of the store, premium Our Brands, including Private Selection, HemisFares and Abound, grew double digits during the second quarter as well. 
 In the second quarter, Our Brands made up 28.2% of unit sales and 26.5% of sales dollars, both of which are record results for a second quarter. Our Brands continue to outpace Kroger's identical sales growth, led by more than a 15% growth in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines during the second quarter. 
 Simple Truth has quickly become the second largest brand sold in our stores since launching 5 years ago. In 2018, Simple Truth reached more than $2 billion in annual sales, making it the largest natural and organic brand in America. Simple Truth's popularity and explosive growth is a major reason why we're starting with the brand in our first international pilot with Alibaba's group Tmall global platform. 
 Restock Kroger is just getting started. We like what we're seeing so far and we're working to keep that trend going. The outcome of our key Restock Kroger drivers is the creation of shareholder value, which we remain committed to delivering over the long term. 
 In June, we announced that Kroger's board approved a dividend increase for the 12th consecutive year. Our dividend has grown at a double-digit compound annual growth rate since it was reinstated in 2006. We continue to expect an increasing dividend over time. We are on track to generate the free cash flow and the incremental FIFO operating profit that we committed to in Restock Kroger through 2020 and to deliver on our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. 
 Now here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to update you on our guidance for the remainder of 2018. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. 
 As noted in our press release this morning for the first half of 2018, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result was slightly ahead of our internal expectations due to the solid early execution of Restock Kroger, including process changes that led to sustainable cost controls and higher-margin alternative revenue streams. This performance will allow us to continue making incremental investments while delivering on our guidance range for the year. 
 We also noted that the second quarter adjustment items relate primarily to the change in the market value of Kroger's investment in Ocado securities. Since our investment and partnership announcement in the second quarter, the share price has doubled. 
 As you know, we accelerated several planned Restock Kroger investments starting in the first quarter and continuing during the second quarter. These include investments in price, especially in support of Our Brands, and in space optimization. Our pricing strategy isn't new. Since 2000, we have invested more than $4.2 billion in lower prices for customers, while also striving to provide the best full-service grocery experience in America. 
 Even as we pursue our long-term strategy, we always look for ways to bank savings before we make significant investments, as we did in the first half of the year. We noted in June that pull-forward investments in Restock Kroger that began in the last 4 weeks of the quarter and continued space optimization rollout will be headwinds to ID sales in the second quarter. So this effect is not a surprise to us. We expect the headwinds from space optimization during the first half of 2018 to come -- become a tailwind late in the third quarter. 
 Looking at our ID sales in the second quarter, 20 of our supermarket divisions had positive IDs, demonstrating Restock Kroger is resonating with customers across the company. Several departments outperformed our total ID sales in the second quarter, most notably natural foods, seafood and pharmacy. We also continue to see growth in households during the quarter. 
 Looking at gross margin, we were pleased to see that our shrink rate continue to improve during the second quarter. The gross margin rate reflects the company's price investments, some rising transportation costs and the growth of the Specialty Pharmacy business. Part of our price investments was to support Our Brands, especially to reduce starting price points. The improvement new movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers. We intend to continue to invest in price to drive unit growth while also delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. 
 OG&A costs increased as a rate of sales driven entirely by higher expense for incentive plans as compared to last year. We continue to face rising credit card fees, especially as more customers shift to using credit cards with higher interchange rates. This is a growing problem, and we are taking steps to address it. 
 You likely saw the news this summer that our Foods Co supermarket division announced that it would no longer accept Visa credit cards as a form of payment. This is because Visa rates and fees among the highest of any credit card brand. We stopped accepting Visa credit cards to save on the high costs associated with credit card companies' interchange rates and network fees. The savings will be passed along to Foods Co customers in the form of everyday low prices on items shoppers purchase the most. 
 Foods Co has stopped accepting the cards in mid-August, and we are currently assessing our next steps. We're prepared to expand nonacceptance to other banners if that's what it takes to get a level playing field for negotiated interchange rates. 
 It's also worth noting that we recently changed our Kroger rewards credit card from Visa to MasterCard. We will continue to aggressively manage OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods. A big focus continues to be on the store productivity and waste. 
 We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in Restock Kroger in redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is how we will generate $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020. 
 Now for an update on our retail fuel performance during the second quarter. Our second -- our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.263 compared to $0.217 in last year's second quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.85 versus $2.28 in the same quarter last year. 
 We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%. Excluding the 2018 first and second quarter adjustment items, we expect the 2018 rate to be approximately 20%. Favorable tax resolutions with certain states during the quarter benefited adjusted second quarter net earnings by about $0.01 per diluted share. 
 As previously announced, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for our Turkey Hill Dairy business, including a potential sale. We want to ensure Turkey Hill has every opportunity to meet its full growth potential. Turkey Hill is a unique CPG food business within Kroger, as it is a strong nationally known brand. Much like our convenience store business, Turkey Hill is such a beloved brand, thanks to the 800 dedicated associates who've contributed to its success. 
 We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of free cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger. The original amount was $6 billion, and we increased it to $6.5 billion after the passage of the federal tax act. We expect the tax act to reduce cash taxes by about $1.2 billion over the next 3 years. We used $700 million of those savings to fund our investment in Ocado and our merger with Home Chef. On one other note -- one other note to this is we have working capital improvements built into the guidance, and we are off to a great start with a $300 million improvement in net operating capital so far this year. 
 Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.59. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect our leverage ratio to remain slightly above the target range, primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the company's merger with Home Chef and investments in Ocado. Kroger remains committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range. 
 Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth, while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating in returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, we have used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion pretax to the company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund. 
 We repurchased 103 million common shares for $2.6 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business unit under a previously announced accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid $435 million in dividends and invested $2.9 billion in capital. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase reauthorization. 
 We're investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits, while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and trainings. In March, we also announced investing a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program, Feed Your Future, and an increased 401(k) match for our nonunion associates. 
 We recently ratified a contract with the UFCW covering Kroger associates in Fort Wayne, and in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas. We are currently negotiating with UFCW contracts for stores covering associates at Smith’s in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. 
 We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant for today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 Turning now to guidance for 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth excluding fuel to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. We updated our GAAP net earnings guidance range to $3.88 to $4.03 per diluted share for 2018, from the previous range of $3.64 to $3.79. This increase in guidance is due to the unrealized gain in Ocado shares recorded in the second quarter and does not reflect any ongoing changes in the market value of Ocado shares because those cannot be predicted. 
 On an adjusted basis, our net earnings guidance range remains $2.00 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. 
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Everything we are doing supports our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift, and we are executing our strategy. We are building a truly seamless shopping experience that we can serve customers Anything, Anytime and Anywhere. We're using our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers be a hero to their families at mealtime every time. 
 We are identifying partners who will help us deliver customer value today and the future. We are laying a foundation for more profitable alternative revenue streams that will also accelerate core business growth. And we are serious about living our purpose to Feed the Human Spirit, because associates, customers and stakeholders are increasingly deciding where to work, where to shop, where to invest and where -- who to support based on a company's commitment to making the world a better place. 
 It's no surprise then that we are very proud that Kroger was recognized in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, our plan to end hunger in places we call home and eliminate waste across our company by 2025. It is exciting to see our vision taking shape, especially because we know that delivering on our vision will create value for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: I wanted to start with the IDs. Can you talk about the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in the third quarter? And then part of this, can you quantify the impact that optimization had on the IDs during the quarter? And just generally, how is that playing out so far relative to what you've expected? 
W. McMullen: I'll start out and I'll let Mike fill in. If you look at the space optimization and the other projects that we mentioned, without those, our identicals would have been a little over 2%. If you look at so far in the third quarter, we're trending a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. Mike, I'll let you talk about the cadence during the quarter. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I think the cadence was actually fairly consistent. There were -- actually, there was a blip or 2 when you look at some things like in Texas last year when we had the disruption down there from Hurricane Harvey, and those kinds of comparisons to the prior year make things a little bit difficult to compare. But when you factor out some of those kinds of items, it was actually fairly consistent. I think the encouraging thing is, is when Rodney talks about where we would have been and why we're very comfortable continuing to give guidance for the year of 2% to 2.5%, what we're seeing on the space optimization stores when they come out of the period of disruption and they get back to business as usual, we're seeing exactly what we expect to see. And obviously, as we get to the back half of the year with the holiday selling season, we won't have stores disrupted and we'll have the stores we're going to realign completed. So we expect to have a great fleet of stores going into the important holiday selling season in the fourth quarter. And 600 of those are redone in a way that is resonating with the customers. 
Edward Kelly: Great. And just as a follow-up on the guidance. From an EPS standpoint, it does seem like so far this year things have been a bit better than what you've expected. And you've talked about that, I think, Mike, that you raised guidance or you lowered guidance for your tax rate, if you could just clarify that. But either way, this quarter, you didn't touch the guidance at all from an EPS standpoint. Is there something out there that incrementally you're concerned about? Or is this simply a case of conservatism, and as you're comfortable around the guidance, you are really thinking about investing in the business for the next couple of years? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the tax rate, obviously, we had the benefit of the favorable tax resolution from a state standpoint in the first quarter with or without the c-store's effects, the tax rate a bit as well, so it's a little bit confusing. So I know it is a little bit lower, but I would remind you that we lowered the -- we raised the low end of our guidance range in the first quarter. And all those kinds of things would have factored into our decision to do that, including the time once the c-store transaction closed and the like, and where we were on state tax issues, knowing things that we weren't going to say publicly yet, all factored into that decision to raise the lower end. Relative to what we do with overperformance, I think you know this as well as anybody, Ed. And we have a very long history, as I indicated in the prepared comments, we like to deliver some results before we make all the investments that we plan to make. Obviously, this year is a little different in that we had the tax act savings to invest and pull some pricing moves forward, while still being able to deliver on our earnings per share growth. And I think you will see us probably decide how we manage through the rest of the year and where we think the dollars are going to be, continue to make investments to grow the business for the long term. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance range today, that's a little over 6% earnings per share growth rate, which I think is a very respectable result in an environment where we're making dramatic investments to reshape the future of the company. I think the management team here at Kroger is proud of being able to refocus our future efforts and still deliver on the bottom line for shareholders. 
W. McMullen: In Mike's last point there, I think it's important to remind everybody that we aggressively continue to invest in our digital businesses. And that -- connecting with that customer will increasingly be important in the future, obviously. Because what we find is when a customer engages with us in all channels, they spend more money with us. 
J. Schlotman: And growing 50% in the digital business doesn't happen without those investments and focus. 
Operator: The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Maybe first just to follow-up on the guidance point. I think there's a little confusion because, like Ed said, the EPS range didn't change, the tax rate came down. So is there some implication that operating income could be lower than you anticipated in the back half of the year? Or is the range just wide enough that there's a range of outcomes considered in the guidance? 
J. Schlotman: I think it's your latter point. We've guided all along when we gave original guidance, and even back last October when we discussed Restock Kroger with everybody, that we expected 2018 to be a year of investment, and that we would expect operating profit margin to be down. We also talked about the fact, in March, that once the tax act got passed, we were going to take some of those savings. About 1/3 of them would fall to the bottom line, which you've seen through the lower tax rate over time. About 1/3 of it would be invested back in the business, meaning some price investments that we pulled forward into this year out of future years. So these are planned investments that we did early, which means that was a conscious decision to lower operating profit a little more than our original plan this year. I think we're as clear as we could be about that in March as compared to where we would have been in October. And then the third leg of that stool is the investment in people that we talked about with the Feed Your Future, where part-time and full-time associates, if you've worked with us for at least 6 months, can get $3,500 a year to continue their education or get a GED or get a specific trade certification as well as the increased 401(k) match for our associates. I think when you balance all of that, the fact that we're going through -- everything we're going through, making the investments, the space optimization work, incremental benefits for a lot of our associates -- and that $3,500 is all associates, that's store associates and office associates alike. I think I'm very happy with how we're managing through this significant year of change and still, at the midpoint, delivering what would be an -- expected to be a 6% earnings per share growth rate or so at the midpoint of our current estimate. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up. Maybe on the gross margin, the investment, a little bit bigger ex fuel than we anticipated. But can you break down for us a little bit investment in price relative to the freight pressure? And how much of the price investment is related to competition that you're seeing from other channels versus an internal plan? And was there anything above and beyond what you anticipated investing because it was such a strong fuel quarter? 
J. Schlotman: I think we were right on track with what we expect to invest in price and the pull-forward investments we wound up making. One of the comments we made in both the press release and in the prepared remarks was the growth of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. Their growth has been quite impressive and their ability to gain new relationships in that world has been quite impressive. That is a very high sales model, a very low gross margin compared to the overall Kroger gross margin. So that mix as it grows -- pulls our gross margin down, but it drives very nice growth in gross margin dollars in that business because of what those pharmaceuticals wind up costing. So when you mix all of that out, I don't think we did anything out of the ordinary from our price investments. It's just what the -- it's just what's out there. And I would be remiss in talking about gross profit if I didn't give a shout-out to our cost and waste team. And a very continued -- I think it's 4 quarters in a row now where we've had improvements in our shrink rate. And with our sales, when you have some very nice improvements in the shrink rate, that's one of the cost savings we expect to help fuel Restock Kroger. And they're delivering on what our expectations are, so we have that fuel for the engine. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I wanted to touch on guidance here as well. I was hoping maybe you could talk about what gives you continued confidence on delivering on the 2% to 2.5% ID sales growth, given that it implies a meaningful acceleration even with more difficult comparison. You talked a little bit about Kroger Restock and the benefits you're expecting to see there in the back half, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about that's going to drive that acceleration here? 
J. Schlotman: I think when we looked at it and decided to keep the 2% to 2.5%, it's something that we certainly think is achievable. And I said on -- when I was on Bloomberg and CNBC this morning, we're laser-focused on delivering on those results. And when you think about Rodney's comment that without the headwind of price investments that we made late in the first quarter that really affected the second quarter pretty dramatically as well as space optimization, without the effect of those headwinds in the second quarter, we would have been over 2%. And as the price investments are in for a longer period of time, the effect as a headwind diminishes because the units start to pick up, like I spoke of in the prepared comments, with the pickup in units in Our Brands where we've made some price investments. And the -- we're more than halfway through our space optimization work. About 55% of the stores that we would expect to be completed are behind us. So as those stores start to mature and come out of the cycle disruption, they will feed the ID sales as we get later this quarter and into the fourth quarter. So it's the combination of those that we expect to come together and be able to deliver in the 2% to 2.5% range. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then just -- I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about inflation/deflation here, what you saw during the quarter, your latest outlook. And are you starting to see price increases come through from your vendors? And are you starting to see shelf prices move up? Any additional color here would be helpful as well. 
W. McMullen: I'll let Mike fill in some of the details. But if you look at overall, really, it was basically 0 on inflation/deflation. You have some of the fresh departments that had a little bit of deflation, but there wasn't anything substantial. So looking forward, we really don't see much change. I would say at this point, we've -- obviously, there's been several announced increases, but we've seen very limited number of increases so far. And the customers certainly wouldn't be experiencing any increase, either, in terms of the prices they're paying. And in fact, it's a little bit less than a year ago. So Mike, I'll let you fill in some of the details. 
J. Schlotman: No, I would agree with you on it's flat overall and there is pluses and minuses in all the different categories. And our LIFO estimate for the year would be substantially, if not entirely, driven by where pharmacy inflation is and the amount of pharmacy business and inventory we have to support that business. 
Operator: The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Karen Short: Sorry, just to -- just on that last question, just to clarify. On cost inflation versus retail inflation, you're saying both are basically flat? Or could you just clarify that? 
J. Schlotman: We were referring to -- at least I was referring to, and I believe Rodney was referring to, cost inflation is what we were talking about. We're not going to get into retail inflation because it's pretty difficult to calculate. As we continue to make price investments as well as the investments we make in Our Brands and the growth of Our Brands, it can look like retail deflation. But a lot of times, it's just growth in a lower price point item, but a higher margin item on the shelf causing that. So we stay focused on where costs are going and deciding how to react to that at retail. 
Karen Short: Okay. And I know on the last earnings call, you'd indicated that you might be willing to give some more concrete data on what kinds of sales lift you're seeing in the optimized stores. Can -- are you willing to do that today? Can you give a little more color? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I think when you think about what we reported in the second quarter of 1.6% IDs, and if you were to factor out the headwind that's out there for space optimization and the price investments late in the first quarter, that we would have been over 2%. I think you see, one, that the headwind of that as well as what the potential tailwind that's out there. I won't get into specifics of exactly what those are generating. But as we see them -- as we see those stores coming out and what they generate and knowing that we're more than halfway through what we want to get done, we're looking forward to that turning into a tailwind late this quarter. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then I guess I just wanted to switch gears to the IDs a little bit and look at the spread between the new definition and the old definition. Obviously, you gave us the historical spread -- I mean, from last year in the net 8k. So obviously, that spread's widening. And I guess what I want to ask is it seems fair to think that, that spread will continue to pretty meaningfully widen as we go forward given the strong growth in digital, is that fair to think about? Because I mean, I think at the end of the day, people still want to get some sense of where your IDs are excluding the digital component. 
J. Schlotman: Well, I spoke of the fact that we had broad-based ID sales growth that are -- on our operating divisions, with 20 of them having positive ID sales, and that would have been on the traditional calculation. That would include ClickList, because they're fulfilled at the store level and would have always been in there. So we're happy, very happy with the trends we're seeing. Obviously, that's disrupted by the space optimization. Space optimization and the price investments at the store level don't really affect things like Ship and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy. 
W. McMullen: Yes, Karen, on your question as you look forward, we would certainly expect the gap to increase over time. It's becoming increasingly difficult. When a customer engages with us and they engage with us on Ship, they engage us -- engage with us on Vitacost and some of the other parts of our business. When they engage multiple places, we get a bigger share of their total and our total sales grow. But in terms of historically, the way we would keep track of that, it does change the mix and where -- how the customer's engaging with us, which is the reason why we changed the definition. But we would expect that gap to continue to increase as we become more multidimensional. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: I guess I'm still a little bit uncertain surrounding the back half guidance here. Mike, just to be clear on the tax rate, you're implying that we're looking for an 18% tax rate in the back half. And if that's correct, then the Street expectations, at the very least, on EBIT is going to have to come down quite considerably. So just trying to get some incremental color on what's driving that versus what we were initially expecting back in March. Is it more in the gross margin line? Is it more OpEx? Just any color would be helpful there. 
J. Schlotman: I mean, when you look at the back half, I don't think we're that low on the tax rate. When you look at the 20% for the year or so, we'll probably be above that in the third quarter, maybe below that in the fourth quarter, because we do try to factor in when we might see things like the tax settlement that happened in the second quarter with 3 different states. There are things out there like that, that wind up happening as well. I'm not going to get into what our EBIT guidance might or might not be on a quarterly or annual basis, because we have guided that it will be down, and we do continue to make the investments we expected to make. And we are using -- we are making incremental investments in the business, using the tax savings that we spoke about in March. I would remind you that all of that said, we generated about $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, when you look at cash provided from operation activities minus our CapEx, which is the pretty standard definition. And we're promising $6.5 billion over the next 3 years. So I think we're off to a pretty nice start to the $6.5 billion. And when you think about the valuation of the company and its ability to grow free cash flow over time. I think we're pretty solid in that respect. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then one quick clarification, then the follow-up. The comp, you actually have seen over 2% in Q2. Was that both price investment and space optimization or strictly space optimization? 
W. McMullen: It's both of them together. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then -- so my follow-up would be just obviously as it relates to the pending storms, all are of course unique, but could you just remind us of the general dynamic that you observe on both on the top line and margins during these sort of events? And then how well do you feel from an inventory standpoint in advance of the hurricane? And did you see any element of acceleration in transportation or freight costs in the Southeast quarter-to-date? 
J. Schlotman: I don't know if I would go specifically to the Southeast, that's pretty narrowly focused. We talked that rising transportation costs affected the gross margin rate overall. When you look at the dynamics of what's going on in the Southeast of the country today, before I get into the specifics, I want to repeat something I said earlier today. And our hearts and minds and prayers and thoughts are with both our associates and customers in that part of the world, because they stand to face a pretty difficult next couple of 3 weeks. And we hope we come through it as well as possible from their standpoint, and the business will be the business. I would tell you that last year at this time, we had a run-up to Hurricane Irma that people forget about. And this -- and right -- and that would have been prior to today. Today, we have the run-up to Hurricane Florence and they kind of offset one another. So we had the comparison to the run-up to Irma that was a headwind at the beginning of the quarter, and now that's been replaced by the incremental sales you get from Florence. And when you factor those out, they pretty well negate one another. And we're trending above with both of those in there, where we finished the second quarter. So we feel like we're off to a good start. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And Mike said it, but there's no 2 hurricanes the same. We have a lot of experience on reacting and addressing hurricanes. And our teams always do an incredible job and work beyond anything that one could expect. But our customers and we all appreciate everything they're doing. Obviously, the first thing is making sure everybody stays safe. But I know yesterday, I received an email from a customer whose daughter lived in one of the affected markets. And she was -- in the email, she said how much she appreciated the fact that we had water and some other things, because other retailers didn't have it. And to the degree that we're able to do things like that, it really is a reflection of our store teams and our warehouse teams and delivery teams making sure that our stores stay in stock. And it's one of those things we do have a lot of experience at. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. And Rodney, when you look what our Atlanta, Harris Teeter and Mid-Atlantic division teams have done to serve the customers and keep our associates safe, our hats are off to them. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just a clarification and then a longer-term question. On the space optimization, the comments that the IDs would be over 2% if you take that out. Is that more of a traffic disruption or a ticket and pricing disruption? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it actually is both, and it's more the average ticket because customers have trouble finding stuff, but it's actually a little bit of both. What we find, once you get through it, though, the customers -- you reallocate the space in the storage, you'll have products that the customer wanted to buy from us that we didn't have before, and we stay better in-stock as well because you reallocate space. So yes, the customers never like it during it, but once you get finished, the customers appreciate what you do and reward us accordingly. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's helpful. And then just some longer-term questions, I guess, first on Ocado. Just a simple question, but we saw the growth in Instacart and the expanded partnership there. It seems like the same-day delivery, maybe there's a lot of demand for that. But I'm just wondering if Ocado will be also able to offer same-day 1- or 2-hour delivery or if that's more of a next-day type offering? Any comments on that would be helpful. And then on Alibaba, just wondering if you're willing to frame what you think the potential could be for that longer term in terms of dollars when that starts, and if you'll include that in your IDs? 
W. McMullen: Yes, the -- in terms of Ocado, Tim and the Ocado team continues to work on improving their model, making it -- using even better machine learning and everything else. There will be certain areas that they will be able to do same day in. I think the key thing gets back to the comment that we've talked about regularly, and that's being able to deliver Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. And it really will be able -- the key will be able to -- for the customers to do it in a seamless way. And we'll use all of the assets, including Ocado, our store facilities and other things to be able to get deliveries to the customers based on when they want it. What we find is there are certain items that customers want more immediately, if you think about what's for dinner tonight. There's other things that you can help them plan out. And the thing that they're more focused on there is getting it in a convenient way. And a convenient way sometimes is picking it up, not necessarily at the store they shop at; and in some cases, delivery. So the key is all of the backstage assets tie in together, but delivering it seamlessly for the customer. And what we find is customers -- some customers like same-day or a couple-hour delivery window. Others are more focused on pickup. And next-day is not -- they view that equally as convenient. On Alibaba on the identicals, Mike, I'll let you... 
J. Schlotman: Our definition is sales to customers. So over time, those will probably wind up being in the ID sales. As we've said, we're kind of dipping our toe in the water at this point to make sure we have systems and processes down. And it's just an expansion of our ability to attract customers, regardless of where they are. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On Alibaba, and what I've been doing investor meetings recently on Simple Truth, the question they ask is the same thing in terms of how big. And it really is, for us, hard to estimate. It's something that we haven't done before. But what we find is that our Simple Truth brand has incredibly strong customer connection. And we believe that's a brand that will work across the world, not just the U.S. And learning and doing that in China is an easy first step. And Alibaba's Tmall is an incredible platform to reach over 0.5 billion customers. So it's really learning and looking at it in terms of is it a brand that will travel internationally, and then does that create a platform for growth. And we certainly think the opportunity is there. It's going to take a lot of work to achieve that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Trussell: Just circling back on margins. As you've mentioned numerous times, 2018 is a year of investments for you guys, and you pulled forward actions on labor and price and store remodels. Just kind of remind us -- or as we look to the second half, are there a different set of puts and takes that we should keep in mind versus the first half on the EBIT front? And just kind of remind us of what's embedded in that 2020 plan in terms of the margin profile. 
J. Schlotman: I won't get into EBIT on the short-term period like the back half of the year, because we haven't given guidance on that. What we've given guidance on is we expect to grow operating profit or EBIT by $400 million over the course of '18, '19 and '20 as compared to where 2017 ended up when you adjust out the 53rd week and you adjust out the convenience store business, because obviously we don't have that going forward, but we sold that for a very nice multiple. So that's what we're very focused on. We talked about the fact, in March, when the tax act was there that we're going to make investments that would reduce EBIT this year. That would be offset by -- on the bottom line by a lower tax expense, and from a cash base standpoint, a lower cash tax expense. And a lot of those investments were pull forwards from either later in '18, meaning there'll be less effect in '19, or actual pull forward investments from '19 into '18. So we will expect ourselves, from an internal standpoint, to grow EBIT more in '19 and probably into '20 than we would have in the original Restock Kroger, because we were able to get some of those investments behind us in 2018 and, hopefully, see those take root and create that extra EBITDA to support our strategy. 
Paul Trussell: Got it. And then just some quick ones. In this past period, to what extent did your private brands outperform national brands? And also if you can just give an update on the click-and-collect program and all the contributors to your digital growth being over 50% this past quarter. 
J. Schlotman: So in Rodney's prepared comments, he talked about Our Brands being 28.2% of units and 26.5% of dollars, both of which are record results for the second quarter. The second quarter is usually a bit of a dip as compared to the first quarter and other quarters, but -- primarily because of soft drinks. Because with the summer holidays, national brand soft drinks have a very strong performance because of the promotions that wind up happening. And when you look at the ClickList and the expansion of digital and the fact that it's up 50%, we talked about the fact that we're up to 80% of our customers now have the ability to either interact with ClickList or one of the home delivery services we have, which is up from about 70% in the first quarter. So we can see continued growth of our customers being able to interact with us that way. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, let me hit private brands first. If -- what have you found your data with price elasticity, private brands versus national brands? And then when you make some price investments on the private brands side, what is the national brand response, if any, to those? Or do they do nothing? 
W. McMullen: Well, I love the question, but there's a lot of pieces behind the question. If you look at Our Brands and the broad spectrum of Our Brands, each brand would have a little bit different answer to the question. So if you look at Private Selection, as a general rule, those are unique items where there really isn't a comparable brand somewhere else. So our brand on Private Selection really is very innovative, new approaches, same for like HemisFares and some of those. So the customer reaction is more in terms of doing something when we keep it fresh and exciting or a flavor that they can't find somewhere else, and that engages with the customer that way. Simple Truth really doesn't have a comparable brand in the market at all. And to the degree that obviously there is a lot of smaller natural and organic brands but it would compete against one piece of our overall brand, not the overall brand. And certainly, what our strategy always has been on natural and organic products is you don't -- shouldn't have to pay a premium. Just because it's natural and organic, it shouldn't have a higher margin in it. And that's been our strategy for numerous years, and our customers have reacted to that very well. When you look at the core banner brand, it really depends on the category. So if you think about milk, the market share is so high there's really not a lot of elasticity there; others would have a different type of elasticity. Overall, you really don't find the national brands reacting much at all in the short term. Usually, the reaction is more longer term and it's usually after a year or 2 of losing share that they decide that they want to do something about the share and then they'll come back and be more aggressive. The key to all of it, and we want all -- so we want the national brands and Our Brands both to grow, and one of the keys is innovation. And I know, almost every time I talk to a national brand partner, I always tell them that you need more innovation. Our teams feel the same way in terms of -- the key is really more innovation. 
John Heinbockel: And then real quick, on the $400 million, roughly what comp is required over the 2 years to get there? And with Ocado investments, right, as you start to move toward implementation of the first 3 or 5, would they impact the $400 million at all? Or no, it's immaterial? 
J. Schlotman: The peak of those investments won't start happening until 2020. And I -- it's factored into our ability to generate the $400 million. And we would still be targeting to generate the $400 million of operating profit margin growth even in light of having the Ocado investments and sheds starting to come online or close to coming online early, hopefully sometime in that time frame. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The price investments, Rodney or Mike, can you just talk about how much of it is skewed towards own brands versus history? Is the -- is it a massive investment in your own brand pricing that's driving your gross margin down and you've eased off price investments on national brands? 
W. McMullen: It would really be across both national brand and Our Brands. And it really is using our 84.51° insights to understand where is the best return for the price investments. So it's actually very much both. 
Robert Ohmes: And then just the very last question would just be some of your -- Walmart, example, as one example, you saw some strong results from some very large retailers even in their food retail businesses in the second quarter. And just maybe help us think about what the consumer is doing from your standpoint. Are you seeing signs of trade-up? And should we see a reversal of market share trends back in your favor at some point when you get through this? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at market share overall on the data, the way that everything's been historically tracked, we continue to gain share. If you look at overall, we're pretty much on track where we would -- where we thought we would be, as Mike mentioned earlier. We continue to see overall market growth, which is good. And we see great opportunities out there to continue to do well what we do good, and that's our strength with our associates and their service and freshness of product. So we continue to see plenty of opportunity to improve our identicals and gain share. As I just mentioned, we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger and especially with our execution of Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, as all of you know, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So before I end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments with our associates. First, as Mike mentioned before, I'd like to acknowledge the many -- that many of our customers and associates are bracing for Hurricane Florence. I know our stores and logistics teams on the East Coast have been working tirelessly for the past week to help our customers and each other be prepared for the storm. For those of you in the hurricane's path, please stay safe and look out for each other. Second, as I mentioned earlier on the call, we are thrilled that Kroger was included in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. This is such an awesome recognition of the work that each one of you are doing to help us achieve our goal. The same week we received the news from Fortune, Kroger was making news of our own. We added a bold new pledge to our existing Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitments by 2025, and that was that we will be phasing out single-use plastic checkout bags. The feedback on that announcement has been enormous and overwhelmingly positive. I know everything that you are doing are the steps to make this become a reality. Thank you for all you do. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2018-06-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Rebekah Manis: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and congratulations on your recent promotion to Director of Internal Relations. Mike and I really look forward to working with you in your new role on a closer basis.
 Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's first quarter of 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 Restock Kroger is off to a great start. I'm especially proud of our team's execution of process changes that led to strong cost controls. We are committed to knowing and serving our customers so well that Kroger serves all of their shopping needs.
 Our most fundamental strategy remains unchanged. As customers' tastes change and their shopping habits evolve, we will be there for them. That means we will make the investments needed to provide our customers with the best full-service grocery experience in America. Plus, we are investing in our associates more than ever before and seeing improvements in retention.
 We are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us, both in-store and online. We are actively improving the store experience. Our space optimization work is ahead of schedule and Our Brands achieved another period of record growth while, at the same time, growing our digital sales by more than 66% in the first quarter which was due to our ongoing expansion of ClickList, our delivery initiatives and identical growth.
 Our first quarter results enabled us to raise the low end of our EPS guidance for the year while also setting us up well to deliver on our identical sales target range for 2018.
 As you know, Restock Kroger is our 3-year plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats. We are making progress in each of the 4 main drivers: Redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Using our deep insights and experience, Kroger is imagining the future of retail by building on our core business plus adding exciting and innovative partnerships like Ocado and our planned merger with Home Chef.
 We believe the future of retail will include both physical and digital customer experiences. Everything we are doing today will enhance our ability to provide everyone in America with convenience of shopping for anything, anytime, anywhere.
 We are incredibly excited that Kroger -- it is Kroger who is bringing Ocado's technology to the U.S. for the first time. The platform includes online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery capabilities. So it's a perfect fit with our vision and strategy. We look forward to innovating together with Ocado to enhance Kroger's digital and robotics capabilities and we are already working to identify the first 3 sites for development of the new automated warehouse facilities in the U.S. to deploy Ocado's proprietary technology and distribution expertise.
 Customers want convenience, simplicity and personalized food experience. Our planned merger with Home Chef will accelerate our ability to deliver exactly this. There is a lot that we admire about Home Chef. Their creativity and entrepreneurial energy and their use of data to connect with customers to name just a few. We believe that by taking over Kroger's meal solutions portfolio, Home Chef will bring our customers even more innovation and delicious offerings so customers can be the hero at mealtime. Pat and his team at Home Chef will be able to leverage Kroger assets, both our physical stores and data, to drive their business even more. And by joining forces, we can grow bigger together than either of us could have done alone.
 We continue to execute our digital strategy through our core business as well. And as I've said before, the households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not and households that purchase from us online spend even more.
 We have aggressively grown our existing seamless coverage to reach approximately 75% of our customers. This includes our network of ClickList locations, stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners as well as ship-to-home capabilities. Our goal is to reach 100% of our customers with the seamless experience and, over time, to reach all across America.
 All the changes we are making to transform our business will make it even easier for families to share meals together. This business strategy enables us to live our Kroger purpose because we know that families who spend -- share meals together have even a better relationship and if they have children, they do better in all aspects of their life.
 Our Brands is another example of how we're redefining the grocery customer experience. Kroger customers choose to put more Our Brands in their baskets and pantries every day. Our Brands grew faster than the national brands in nearly every department and gained significant share overall.
 In the first quarter, Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.7% of sales dollars. In fact, Our Brands set the record for the highest ever retail dollar share in our history. Our Brands achieved a 5.1% sales growth at a 3.4% unit growth in the first quarter led by double-digit growth again in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines.
 Last quarter, we said that the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would enable us to celebrate investments in Restock Kroger. This is possible because we are taking a balanced approach to how we are spending and investing the benefits. It's distributed evenly between our associates, our customers and our shareholders. This approach is in line with Kroger's purpose and is helping us make strategic investments and develop talent.
 We are investing more than ever before in our associate experience. It all starts with the $0.5 billion investment in wages for many store associates that is part of Restock Kroger. We're also increasing the company's 401 contribution match to help associates retire with more money in their pockets plus expanding associate discounts to keep more money in their pockets today.
 The one piece that I'm most excited about is Feed Your Future. Our new offer of up to $3,500 in annual tuition assistance to any associate who wants to attend classes to build a better future for themselves. Whether they're interested in completing a GED or an undergraduate degree, an MBA or a professional certification, associates can take advantage of up to $21,000 in total assistance as long as they have been with us for at least 6 months and that's on whether they're a full-time or part-time employee.
 As someone who got their start stocking shelves on the night shift in Lexington, Kentucky for Kroger in 1978, I can attest to education's life-changing power. I worked my way through college and, upon graduation, I was so proud to accept a full-time job with Kroger. The incredible learning experiences and work that makes a difference in people's daily lives has kept me here ever since.
 Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and stay for a career. We believe that making education benefits available to more associates and at more generous levels than ever before is the best way to support their career and their future professional growth. And as part of Restock Kroger, we fully expect these investments will have an ROI that will create shareholder value.
 We are in the process of transforming our business so that in the future, we can connect within -- with customers in ways that add more ease and convenience to their lives. To do this and to do it profitably, we must have an economic model that supports this transformation.
 Kroger is better positioned than anyone to make this transformation because we have a set of unique and differentiating strengths. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads us to deep customer knowledge and [ unparelled ] personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines broad experience with creativity and diversity of thought. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. We connect personally with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives. And we have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program.
 Because of these strengths, we are on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental FIFO operating profit we committed to in Restock Kroger. We are confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.
 Now, here is Mike to share more details on our first quarter and update you on our guidance for 2018. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.
 We are very pleased with our first quarter ID sales and earnings results. We did slightly better than our internal expectations. We completed the sale of our convenience stores business unit. And as Rodney said, we had one of the best cost control quarters in a long time due to implementing process changes.
 This is important because over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and our infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make these strategic investments to grow our business.
 We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan.
 We've already re-prioritized the way we will invest capital over the next 3 years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost savings opportunities across both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale these demands through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments. Our investment in Ocado is a great example of what's possible of our new approach to investing capital.
 We continue to aggressively manage OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. A big focus continues to be on store productivity and waste. Our teams controlled shrink well in the first quarter. As we've said before, we won't leave a $0.01 on the table as we seek to reinvest savings to grow our business.
 We plan to generate $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020. We are taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward into 2018 so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated.
 Our pull-forward investments in Restock Kroger began in the last 4 weeks of the first quarter. While the incremental 401(k) contribution match investment was retroactive to the first of the year, costs to support our new associate education program, Feed Your Future, had not begun in earnest. Our investments in wages will roll in as contracts are negotiated and the education payments will occur over time as associates take advantage of the opportunities to further their education.
 We will make investments for the rest of the year to drive our strategy and keep prices low to retain our customers. As a reminder, since 2000, we've reduced prices to our customers by over $4 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit and ID sales growth while delivering on bottom line for our shareholders.
 We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in Restock Kroger in defining the customer grocery experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is precisely where the incremental FIFO operating profit will come from over the next 3 years.
 For ID sales, we're pleased with our result for the first quarter. Several departments outperformed the company in the first quarter, most notably meat, seafood and our floral department. Natural foods continued to generate strong double-digit growth in the first quarter. And during the quarter, we saw growth in households and loyal households as well as unit growth.
 As noted in our press release this morning, we reported identical supermarket sales without fuel of 1.4%. This result was aligned with our internal expectations for the quarter.
 When calculating identical sales to be more inclusive of all company business units, including Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and ship-to-home solutions, our ID sales without fuel were 1.9% in the first quarter. We intend to use this calculation going forward as it presents a comprehensive view of our performance as we redefine the grocery customer experience and is therefore a more appropriate measure of our performance. We've also looked at what others include in their ID calculations and have taken this step to be more consistent with how our peers report.
 Our space optimization work is right on plan. We have about 30% of our planned 600 stores completed for 2018. Space optimization will continue to be a headwind to ID sales until late third quarter. By then, we will have more stores completed and maturing than in process or not yet started, which is why it will start to be a benefit to sales later in the year.
 Retail perform -- retail fuel performance during the quarter was good again. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.187 compared to $0.171 in last year's first quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.65 versus $2.28 in the same quarter last year. This includes convenience stores for the period prior to the divestiture.
 In April, we completed the sale of our convenience store business unit for $2.15 billion. After tax proceeds, we'll total $1.7 billion. We are returning a significant amount of the capital to shareholders through our $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and we used the balance of the after-tax proceeds to lower our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio compared to the end of fiscal 2017.
 Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.43 on a 52-week basis. Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5x. We expect our net total debt-to-EBITDA -- our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to increase throughout the year due to increased borrowings to fund our investment in Ocado, our planned merger with Home Chef and tax payments related to the gain from the sale of our convenience store business unit.
 Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.
 Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pretax to company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund; repurchased 110 million common shares for $2.7 billion, which includes $1.1 billion repurchased through the accelerated stock repurchase plan; paid $442 million in dividends and invest $3 billion in capital. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the March share repurchase authorization. Purchases under the ASR will be completed no later than July 6.
 We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.
 We have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and a compensation package to provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to guidance for 2018. We expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. This reflects our updated definition of identical sales and is supported by an expectation for identical supermarket sales that is the same as our original guidance for the year. To be clear, if we hadn't updated the ID sales definition, we would have confirmed our original guidance for the year this morning.
 We have raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $3.64 to $3.79 per diluted share for 2018. The previous GAAP range was $3.59 to $3.79. On an adjusted basis, we raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $2 to $2.15 per diluted share compared to $1.95 to $2.15 previously.
 We feel very good about the year. We planned for the first quarter to be our strongest EPS quarter, which creates a tailwind for the investments we plan the rest of the year. Our first quarter was a $0.10 outperformance over the consensus forecast. And as I said earlier, it was also a little better than our internal expectations.
 Looking at the consensus forecast through the remainder of the year, we believe the second and fourth quarters are a little high compared to our own expectations and the third quarter looks reasonable. I've taken the unusual step of commenting on this because if you simply add the $0.10 to your forecasts for the year, that would put the consensus above the high side of our guidance range.
 We're off to a great start to 2018 and are on pace to deliver our $2 to $2.15 net earnings per diluted share guidance range for the year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions, and the purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. And finally, we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.
 And now, I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.
 When we announced Restock Kroger, we talked about retailers needing to constantly reinvent themselves. It takes time to do this. We're now past the halfway point and everything we are doing today is transforming our business for renewed growth.
 For 2018, we are a little ahead of where we thought we'd be. We're hitting our cost control targets due to process change, improving the associate experience and innovating to create the future of retail. That innovation is both internal and external. We are joining up with external partners like Ocado and Home Chef to create customer value while quickly expanding our seamless coverage area. We remain confident in our ability to deliver both on our plan for the year and to execute Restock Kroger over the next 3 years, which will create shareholder value.
 Now, we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Michael Lasser: I have 2 questions. One, why is buy versus build the right decision for some of the recent actions you've taken? Particularly in the home delivery market, that is increasingly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. And then, I have a second question on the guidance. 
J. Schlotman: I'm not sure what you mean by buy versus build on the home delivery. We really haven't -- obviously, with Home Chef and the meal kits, we did anticipate merging with them. And they have a great process and a great home delivery business of those meal kits, but as Rodney said, they're also going to take over managing the in-store portion of that business as well. So they'll get insight not just to home delivery, but also delivering the meals to those customers in the brick-and-mortar environment as well.
 Another aspects of home delivery. We're actually creating partnerships, whether it's with Instacart as we do today in areas or as we further our relationship with Ocado and start building the sheds here in the U.S. and have that be an avenue for home delivery as well. We think some of these partnerships and the phenomenal technology and proprietary information and processes that Ocado has will accelerate our ability to do those in the U.S. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Just one additional thing to Mike's comment. I mean, we're really looking at what's a blend of both and which one accelerates for us to be able to get it complete as fast as possible in an efficient way and making sure that we maintain and grow on the relationship with the customers. So it's really looking at partnerships and some things we continue to build on our own. If you look at our own ClickList business, we're growing on our own. So it's really a blend of both. 
Michael Lasser: That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the guidance. Can you give us a little bit more insight into some of the moving pieces? Are you -- have you changed what's embedded for operating profit dollars for this year? Particularly after it sounded like you're seeing more success with some of the process improvement and process changes that are resulting in SG&A dollars savings, even there's -- it's hard for us to tell given what's been provided. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't -- I would say we haven't changed our view of where operating profit dollars would trend for the year. It would be a consistent view that we would expect, overall, for 2018 to be a bit of an investment year. Obviously, our share count is a lot lower, which will help your earnings per share calculation.
 We are off to a great start for the year. I think we purposely, if you look at how we've set this year up, we purposely made sure we had some of the savings in the bank from the process changes. We began to pull-forward investments in the business in the last several weeks of the quarter. So you didn't see a lot of the effect
 [Audio Gap]
 from the investments we're going to make in price and other service elements in the store until very late in the quarter. Those will start to happen in the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year as well. 
Operator: The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: I wanted to first just ask about the comps and the outlook. Could you talk about the cadence of the IDs throughout the quarter and what you're seeing so far in Q2?
 And just as we think about the full year, obviously you maintained your ID guidance. It does look like there's going to be less inflation probably than what maybe we would have thought about a quarter ago. So I guess it suggests that your outlook on tonnage is probably a bit better than what it's been. And clearly, just to get that number, right, you need an improvement from here. So just your thoughts on all that would be helpful. 
J. Schlotman: Sure, Ed. If you look at IDs, obviously, we're just barely below the guidance range. Either the old definition or the new definition, we're only 10 basis points short of being inside our guidance range for the year. So it's not a huge hill to climb to be inside that guidance range for the year.
 There are a lot of moving parts to ID sales out there. I would agree with you on inflation. There certainly isn't as much inflation. There's mid -- between 1% and 2% inflation in pharmacy. The rest of the business would probably be 0.5% to a little less than 0.5%. And in some categories, it's actually deflationary, but it's a little bit all over the board.
 When you think about -- as we continue to execute our space optimization strategy, that certainly creates a headwind today. We think that headwind will continue to mitigate throughout the second quarter, a little bit -- it will lessen, it will continue to be a headwind. And by the time we get to late third quarter, we would expect that to turn to be a tailwind, which we think will help offset some of the headwind we create on our own on the retail cost deflation by the investments and prices we're making.
 I would say our expectations for ID sales this year were not really predicated on an inflation-driven result. It was based on a unit-driven result. Just when you think about the fact we knew we were going to be creating headwinds early in the year with space optimization and now that we've done the first slug of the pull-forward investments we planned to make at the end of this quarter, that will create some -- a bit of a headwind in the near-term as well.
 And answering your question about where we are so far in the quarter, I think our expectations from the quarter would be that we would expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of where we were in this year's -- in the first quarter. We would expect the second quarter to be comparable to that. We're slightly below it, but keep in mind, we're probably at the peak of the headwind for space optimization today and we're right in the biggest portion of having made all of the pull-forward price investments we made in the last 4 weeks of the quarter. All of those are converging right now.
 And we continue to be very happy with the unit growth we see and the response from our customers of what we see in reacting to the price investments, a lot of those in Our Brands. And you heard Rodney talk about Our Brands unit growth in the first quarter of over 5%, which is -- it's not only phenomenal product, it's a phenomenal result and even more value for our customers. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And just another question for you is on labor and labor negotiations and structuring of contracts. Obviously, it does seem like you're approaching negotiations a little bit differently and trying to structure contracts that provide you with more flexibility within the store, particularly around sort of like who can do what, right? Can you just give a little bit more color on what you're looking to accomplish there? And then as we think about the structure of those changes, how does that play into your ability to drive labor cost savings in the stores going forward? 
W. McMullen: If you look at overall, in terms of the approach, it's really contemporizing the way our associates are paid and understanding we have 5 generations in the workforce and having a pay design that connects with each one of those 5 generations. So a big part of every negotiation is understanding the balance between health care and pension. We still have, as Mike mentioned, one of the most generous health care and pension benefits in the industry. Some of our younger associates, that's not as important, and making sure that we balance plan designs with wages. As you know, we've increased starting wages and a lot of the acceleration that's part of Restock Kroger was acceleration of starting wages. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing improvements in retention.
 The -- in terms of the ability -- you're always working on process changes to improve how the workflows and use direct -- reduce labor so that our -- we can reinvest that labor in better service. So if you think about today, we're investing labor in ClickList, we're investing labor in some of the service departments, and what we're able to do is as our business continues to grow, it also creates more demand on people.
 I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. And one of the exciting things we're seeing is we're starting to see the green shoots of the investments in the opening wage rates for our associates and our ability to retain that associate for a longer period of time. If we can keep that associate for a full year, we're actually on the positive side of the investment because we haven't invested -- we haven't had to hire and train and get a new associate up to speed. And that cost is actually more than the dollar an hour wage investment for 2,000 in [ ADRs ] worked in a year. So it winds up being very positive for our associates. They can -- they get more pay. And it winds up being positive for our customers because you have a more experienced and recognizable workforce as well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. You hear us talk about -- a lot about opportunity culture. And what we find is when people love people and love working with people and they love food, we're a beautiful place to come. And people come here for a job, but as they spend time around people and the [ fastest going ] and the ability to understand how they impact peoples' lives every single day, they fall in love with it, and that's when it becomes a career. And the nice thing about us is as -- many of the people -- over 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates. So it's a great place to come for a job and then make it a career. 
Edward Kelly: I do think -- what I was trying to get at, I think part of the reason that your cost structure is higher, right, it's because there are different work rules in the stores relative to some of your nonunionized peers. And are those things that you're able to address through restructuring of labor contracts? I think, more recently, maybe you had done that in one of the contracts that you had talked about. 
J. Schlotman: It's certainly a component in every negotiation we have of getting wall-to-wall clerk status in those contracts. So whatever task needs to be completed next, we can manage a workforce that can do all the tasks inside of a store rather than need to have 3 or 4 different employees all ready to do the next task in each individual department. That was clearly a component of the Cincinnati negotiation that we completed most recently. And it's not like flipping a switch for Cincinnati where they immediately understand how to manage a work schedule with a clerk like that after many years of not having that type of a clerk. So those savings continue to grow in the Cincinnati market, but we strive to get that more and more added. It's an important component of, one, we have to hire. We have to have fewer people because I can have one person work 15 or 16 hours a week instead of 4 people working a few hours in every department. [indiscernible] of hours worked. 
Operator: The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: So I just want to make sure I am understanding this. So Mike, based on your comments on consensus EPS for 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, it implies operating profit swings from being slightly up in 1Q to kind of being down somewhere in the 20% range 2Q to 4Q. Is that -- first of all, that's fair, right? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I don't have that exact math right in front of me. We've been very outspoken about the fact that we expect operating profit dollars to be -- FIFO operating profit dollars to be down this year as compared to last year. That would continue to be our expectation. And as I said earlier in the prepared comments, we continue to make the investments in the business and they became later in the year as well. 
Karen Short: Okay. And the reason that the swing is so extreme from 1Q into 2Q is, as you said, the remodels ramp and price investments ramp pretty meaningfully? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we made a lot of the pull-forward price investments we made in the last 4 weeks of the quarter. We wanted to make sure we had that tailwind and knew that we were going to get the cost savings before we made the investments and just hoped about it.
 One other thing I would remind you about the year-on-year comparison is, last year had 53 weeks and this year has 52 weeks. So you have to adjust for that as well. 
Karen Short: Okay. And so just switching gears, I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on how many units you've actually -- or maybe you will have completed on the Restock program by the end of maybe 2Q? And then, if there's any early indication you could give us on how you think comps of those stores are performing and maybe separate out how comps in stores that didn't have optimization are performing versus the ones that did? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I guess, I can give you comp by store, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're about 30% of the way through the 600. So that would mean we've got about 200 or so of the stores completed. That doesn't mean that they've gone through the maturation process that it takes a few weeks after the completion for the customer to come back in the store, get familiar with the new layout of the store, make sure -- there are instances where our customer is looking for something. In the near term, kind of throws up the white flag until they can figure out exactly where everything is located in the new layout.
 Now, we staff up and have maps and things like that, but that takes a while. As I said earlier, we expect over the course of the next couple of periods that the peak amount of the headwind from the space optimization will be occurring. And by the time we get late in the third quarter, we will clearly have more stores completed going through -- and on the upside of the maturation process than stores we have left to start or that are still in process.
 Well, it's a little early at this point in time to talk about the stores and the lift we're having. We actually had that conversation yesterday in our meetings and we would think -- we think that's probably something we'll address in the second quarter. What I would tell you is what we're seeing so far is exactly -- it's exactly the pattern that we would expected and that we saw on the 20 or so stores we did early in this process to determine it was something worth doing on a broader basis. So we haven't seen any surprises whatsoever. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then, just the last question. Has there been any contemplation that maybe you could accelerate opening the Ocado facilities? I mean, I know you've given us the time line and you're still evaluating the markets, but it would seem that maybe an acceleration would be something that would be viewed favorably. 
W. McMullen: Well, we're going to open the facilities as fast as we can. Obviously, there's a certain amount of time it takes to construct a facility and then for Ocado to build it out. So there's plenty of pressure on Ocado and us to get them open as quick as we can, but there is obviously a certain amount of time in terms of what it takes to actually get the work done. 
J. Schlotman: I just want to point out one thing on your question on operating profit. I would encourage you to look at the tables attached to the press release to understand the adjustment items that are in there because I think when you pull out the C stores, when you pull out -- we had a mark-to-market gain on the Ocado shares we owned before the announcement of the merger. That was like $36 million, which is on Table 6 of the earnings release.
 I think when you look at operating profit margin dollars apples-to-apples, the dollars were actually down slightly in the quarter as compared to last year, not up, which is exactly the trend we expect. But again, it goes -- it's all about balance and trying to keep things within the range we have. There are -- there were several things that happened in the first quarter that were income that we took out of adjustment items when you look at -- I think it's Table 6 in the press release that's... 
Karen Short: Yes, it's 5. Yes. 
J. Schlotman: That will be an important table for everybody to look at. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I just wanted to first clarify what is outside ID sales now? Is it just new stores, remodels and jewelry? Or am I missing something? 
J. Schlotman: Net new stores would not be in. Relocations would not be in. Well, the stores don't go in until they're open in their current state for 5 full quarters. So if we expand, relocate or open a new store, it's the fifth quarter where they go in.
 There are other parts of our business that generate revenue, things like 84.51° and our data sales and those kinds of items, that we don't include in ID sales. What is in ID sales are things we sell directly to a customer, whether it's through a brick-and-mortar store or an online business. That is what's in ID sales today going forward. 
Kenneth Goldman: And then -- sorry, go ahead, please. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Some of our competitors would include expansions, but we do not include expansions in our calculation. We didn't before and we still don't. Sorry, Ken. 
Kenneth Goldman: No, that's okay. I'll follow-up afterward on some specifics, but that's helpful.
 I also wanted to ask a little bit about Rodney's comment about, over time, reaching all of America. And given that the Northeast has such a dense population and given that you don't really have a presence there, is that sort of a hint, Rodney, about how you view the potential of Ocado going forward? I just wanted to kind of get a sense of what that comment meant. Or maybe I misheard it and I just wanted some clarification there, if I could. 
W. McMullen: Yes. You did not mishear it. And that is our vision and our aspiration. And obviously, that will be one piece of the puzzle on serving that. Home Chef will also be one piece of serving it. And we -- our customers tell us we do a great job of helping them solve every day needs in a great way. And any way that we can expand the number of people that can get access to that, that's good for our customers. It's good for our associates. And when we do things good for those, our shareholders benefit. So you did not misinterpret my comment. 
Kenneth Goldman: One last one, if I could just sneak one in, is on your Corporate Brands, your own brands. Do you think -- you talked them up a little bit more than usual I think, at least the tone seemed to be that way to me. How much of that was due to some of the changes you've made in Restock Kroger in terms of prioritizing private label in certain categories, putting them at the top right in the middle of the shelf? So I just wanted to get an idea of whether there's a correlation there in your mind. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'm going to give you a little bit more answer, Ken, than you probably even want. But one of the things last year that our team did was a very elaborate analysis of Our Brands versus our competitors, their own brands, and we also did taste comparisons and quality comparisons versus national brands. And one of the things that we had underappreciated was the quality of our product scored incredibly well with our customers and potential customers. So one of the things that Mike and Robert and their teams and Gil, their teams decided to do was based on that insight is to be much more aggressive about telling our customers the quality of what we have and what we have to offer. So really, that's what caused us to make our own brands such a key and integral part of Restock Kroger. It's that commitment and drive that our customers are supporting us. And it's showing in the results. 
Operator: And our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So I know it's early, but 2 questions on Ocado. It obviously can do a lot of things for you. But when you think about the ability to do ClickList in a more labor-efficient manner, maybe be less disruptive to the stores, so how important is that, right, on the pecking order? And then if it is important, just the transition, how would you transition that?
 And then secondly, when you do Ocado in a market where you don't have brick-and-mortar, is it important -- could you -- would you want to have some brick-and-mortar? And does that open the door to partnering with other retailers or is that just too difficult to do? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I love your questions and I agree with your comment that it's early in the process. What we're really trying to do is to make sure that we have an overall infrastructure for digital that can support whether it's 5% of share or 30% of share. If it ends up being 30% of share in grocery as digital, then the Ocado, you'll have more sheds and they'll be used to take pressure off of a store and a store will become more of a distribution point. So what we're really trying to design is a flexibility of a system that can scale based on how the customer changes. We would expect that Ocado would be something that we will pick orders out of for stores if the orders in a store comes to a high enough percentage that it affects the customer's experience. 
John Heinbockel: You don't -- today, there's no -- because the volume is so modest, there's no evidence that doing ClickList adversely impacts the in-store experience, correct? 
W. McMullen: Yes. So far, it doesn't, but the thing that we don't know, if you look at our sales growth on ClickList or our digital overall, it was in the high 60s and in -- and some of that growth is in -- is driven by identicals. And we're starting to get a pretty good base of identical stores that are on ClickList. If it continues to grow at its pace, we certainly could see, when you go out a couple of years, where it could and we want to be proactive on being positioned to deal with it versus reactive to dealing with it. 
John Heinbockel: All right. Fair. And then just lastly, the price investments you are making this year, right, compared to prior rounds, what does the elasticity look like, right? So I imagine there is kind of a -- we're getting -- you get the high-volume items first. We're getting to a longer tail. Is the elasticity less significant than prior rounds? 
W. McMullen: I guess, I would -- elasticity is consistent with what we expected it would be. There are certain categories where there's very little elasticity. There's others that would have elasticity. So so far, the investments have been consistent with what we would have expected. And you're always balancing a mix between those different items. 
Operator: And the next question comes from William Kirk of RBC Capital Markets. 
William Kirk: So we've seen some high-profile closures at some of your competitors. I guess, the first part of that is have you seen a material benefit from any of those closures? And second, do you expect more closures to come? And in particular, I'm thinking of the California market. Is there any pending closures that you'd expect in that marketplace? 
J. Schlotman: Well, you can certainly never predict when a competitor is going to wind up closing. And if you look around some of our markets where there had been closures, we've been the beneficiary in a few ways: One, from picking up the business; two, from picking up some of their closed store sites like we did in Indianapolis when Marsh closed and as Farm Fresh has exited the Hampton Roads area. We picked up some of those stores and some other folks have as well. You continue to see those kinds of things happening as well.
 Southeastern Grocers, as they emerge from bankruptcy, we're not obviously very affected by the stores in Florida they closed, but as they repositioned their portfolio of BI-LO stores, there's certainly a number of those that would have gone up against either a Kroger store or a Harris Teeter store. So those wind up being beneficial. We didn't really pick up much of anything from there. There was only one or 2 stores that had any interest. And I, frankly, don't even know if they came to fruition as I sit here right now.
 But anytime a store closes in a market, it winds up helping. Sometimes our folks say, well, they're only doing x volume in the business. And I say, well, if you get half of that and divide it by the sales of the nearest store, you're talking 3% or 4% IDs for that store. So it can be kind of beneficial when those come in on top because those incremental sales are very valuable. 
W. McMullen: And broader, over time -- this isn't specific to any market -- we would expect continued consolidation in our industry. And that's been a trend that's happened for the last -- for 20, 30 years.
 And I'm trying to remember, Mike may have mentioned it this morning on one of the interviews. If you look at competitors in terms of who has market share, almost 30% of the market share is still held by people without our economies of scale. 
William Kirk: Okay. That's useful. And then separately, on the convenience stores, now that, that transaction's closed, are there any other assets that would be worth considering divestiture or is that the streamlining that needs to be done at this time? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I wouldn't -- we're constantly looking at our portfolio. We constantly look at closing underperforming stores and reallocating capital. I wouldn't say that we're -- specifically want to sell anything or buy anything, but we're cognizant of what might be more valuable to someone else versus us. That's really what happened with the convenience store business. It's a business we had invested a lot of capital in and multiples of EBITDA for the sales of those are pretty much at all-time highs. And it was a prudent time to have that asset and found a great partner in EG who wound up taking all of our associates. And it's a process we go through with our board on a regular basis. So they understand which assets that we have are generating a good return on invested capital and which aren't. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Judah Frommer of Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: So first, maybe just on the competitive and pricing environment, and this is somewhat tied to inflation. But if we listen to commentary out of what I would call some smaller players, it sounds like they are seeing some passing on of whatever little inflation there is to shelf pricing, but that seems less and less important for players like yourselves or larger competitors that are more focused on targeted promotions. So what are you seeing out there? And how important is it to continue to invest in pricing environment where maybe some other players are pulling back there? 
J. Schlotman: Well, in our mind, as you know, a big portion and the fundamental piece of Restock Kroger is to continue to invest in our business and that takes several forms. It's -- when we say invest in the business, everybody immediately goes to price. Price is an important component of it. We are making investments in price in certain categories. I would say we're not opposed to a retail shelf price going up. And sometimes, we have to be cognizant as the dominant player in many markets. If there's price inflation in a particular item or a particular category, if the big players don't pass on that inflation, it's probably not going to get passed on. So we do make those value judgments day in and day out as we look at the particular categories where the inflation might be. This is a game of what's -- how do we make sure that our offering resonates with the consumers and we try to balance all facets of that. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. And then, maybe switching gears back to Ocado. If we think about ClickList and home delivery being kind of the key components of online grocery now and what Ocado has been doing in their home market in terms of better profitability on basket given just kind of fewer picking touches and efficiencies like that, how do you think about the potential for your online grocery business's profitability over time as Ocado comes in? 
W. McMullen: We would certainly view that it's part of the overall equation and improving the profitability over time, but we're -- as you've heard us talk about before, what we're really focused on is when somebody decides to eat something, they can get it from us. And we're increasingly adding delivery service to markets. We're using our data to help inspire people on what a meal that they will enjoy. So it's part of that overall ecosystem as we create the retail of the future. So it's an important component of that, but it's one piece of the total puzzle. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I wanted to touch on your commentary just about the better cost controls during the quarter. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what's driving those improvements and the process changes in the benefit on your cost line? 
J. Schlotman: Well, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our shrink folks had a great result in the quarter and continue to get a better result on our waste. And they're looking at it -- really, they don't use the word shrink. We use the word shrink because that's what resonates with all of you.
 Internally, we talk about waste. And they're trying to understand every facet of waste, whether it's not having the product aligned in the back cooler the right way to get on the sales floor before it goes out of code, making sure the back doors are locked so a product only comes in the back door and not out the back door, making sure that the high theft areas of our store are monitored generally electronically. You can go in stores today and you'll see visible cameras in high theft areas like cosmetics. They probably saw me this weekend when I waved to one of the cameras when I was in my local Kroger store. They're probably wondering -- now, they'll probably going to watch me in every store I go into. But those kinds of techniques are out there to prevent the waste. And when you have those kinds of techniques in there, people are less likely to even try. And when they do try and they get caught, that does spread through that community and they stop trying with you.
 But it goes across the broad spectrum of monitors on cooler doors not being shut at a store. And if it's open for x seconds, not only does it waste energy, it lets hot air in and the product quality can be diminished. Well, with our temperature monitoring process that we actually originally put in as a labor savings initiative in the store so we didn't have to go about the store and -- I'm starting to talk like the Brits and go about the store. I've spent a lot of time with Ocado -- but go about the store and take temperatures. What you really find is it winds up being quite a bit of a waste reduction benefit in keeping the cold chain secure.
 I'd like to say it used to be you didn't know an ice cream freezer was losing temperature until you saw the ice cream melt. Now, we get an alert that, that motor in that ice cream case is being inefficient. You can get the product out, get the motor fixed and probably get it fixed with a repair instead of a replacement like what we used to have to do in the past.
 So there's a whole lot of things like that. I highlight waste today because they're working really hard and having really great results. And I want to have a little bit of a shout out to that team and thank you for all the hard work they've done. It's starting to show. It's in the results. 
Operator: And that final question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: So wanted to go back. Obviously, it's still early, but digital clearly increasing in focus. Just wondering, with maybe some of the 84.51° data that you guys have and some of the areas where it's a bit longer, can you give us any kind of further color on what you are seeing from a customer perspective? So meaning in the stores where some form of it had been available for a while, kind of how is the progression changing? What's in the basket, ticket frequency to the store? And then maybe also just as you're looking at these first 3 Ocado facilities, anything at this point that you can provide in terms of thoughts around how much of the geographies or stores that, that may encompass? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at digital, the -- I think the key point -- and this is the part that hasn't surprised us at all. When a customer engages with us digitally, we get a higher share of their total household spend. And what we find is the customer still comes into the store, but they come into it based on when they want to or -- an example I always think of is if you've got a couple of kids at home and they bring their friends over, you probably didn't buy food for their friends and somebody will stop by or get a delivery to their house really quick. So what we find is the more digitally engaged somebody is, the higher their total household spend is.
 It's not necessarily consistent from week-to-week in terms of your share of how much of it's digital and how much of it's physical in the store. The thing that's absolutely critical is to do it in a seamless way and do it seamlessly from food inspiration or help you eat healthier.
 We just launched an app called OptUP and we're able to -- if a customer opts in, we can help a customer eat better on a sugar basis. Over time, we'll have more functionality, but today, it's more minimizing and managing your sugar intake. But all of those things is how do we make your life easier and how do you live your life -- how do we help support you living your life the way you want to? So everything that we're doing, what we're trying to do is to make sure it's seamless across all our channels. So that's really the piece that we're working hard on.
 On your second question on Ocado, that's one of the things that the Ocado team is actually working with us and modeling is to understand how far can a shed reach in a market. And as you know with Ocado, they also have local depots as well that will be part of a shed network. And right now, they are actually modeling -- answering your question -- your question's a great one, but we are in the middle of modeling that. And so at some point, we'll be able to answer with more specifics, but at this point, we're still working on that. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And if I could just fit one more fast one in here if you don't mind because we get asked about this all the time. I think it's been now 2 quarters since you had mentioned within -- kind of some of the gross margin benefit about vendor negotiations. Any updates there? Like, how are some of those conversations going? And maybe just even as we go through the year, I think 3Q, just from a compare, is kind of the most difficult. So any updates there that you can share or just basic thoughts, that would be great. 
J. Schlotman: So our team that negotiates the cost of goods with our vendors continue to have great success using a variety of techniques depending on the category. And keep in mind, everything we do on our negotiation process begins with the customer in the forefront and understanding by category what items are important to the customer, what items might be less important to the customer. And that begins the whole -- the entire negotiation process and, oftentimes, playing one vendor off of another when the customer might be indifferent to it.
 I would say it's right on track with our expectation. It is a big component of our expected savings over the next 3 years. And I'm thrilled with what that entire team has done. And we've brought some new talent into that group. And we're really thrilled with how that group has hit the ground running on not only cost of goods, saving of goods for sale, but also goods not for resale, so supplies and the like and other items that we consume ourselves in doing business every day. 
W. McMullen: We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well.
 So before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them. We are very proud of Kroger's opportunity culture where you can come for a job and stay for a career. And as you know, we took 1/3 of our tax savings to invest in new and enhanced benefits for our associates. We used part of that investment to establish our best-in-class educational offering, Feed Your Future. I'm thrilled to see so many of you already taking advantage of these new benefits.
 Let me tell you a story about one of the first associates to take advantage of Feed Your Future. Lindsay is a pharmacy technician in our Louisville division. She was working her way through college, accumulating student loans and had planned to stop working to focus on school full-time. But after an assistant store manager told her about Feed Your Future, Lindsay decided to stay with Kroger while she finishes her bachelor's degree. And now, Lindsay's goal is to pursue a graduate degree with dreams of becoming a physician's assistant for our Little Clinic business.
 Lindsay's story is exactly what we hoped would happen when we introduced Feed Your Future. We believe that when we support our associates and each other and our customers, business and shareholders will benefit.
 Thank you for all you do for each other and everybody every day. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-03-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thanks, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 At our investor conference in October, we discussed the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant, and Kroger is right in the middle of such a reinvention. We are proactively addressing customer changes, and we've made strategic decisions to invest in a seamless digital experience, technology, associate wages and low prices. Combined, these efforts come together in Restock Kroger, our plan to create shareholder value by redefining how people eat. Our vision is to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. 
 Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers: redefine the grocery customer experience, expand partnerships to create customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these focus areas will create shareholder value.
 We announced Restock Kroger 6 months ago while also in the middle of one of the most complicated years in our history. Throughout 2017, we continue to challenge our team to deliver our revised identical sales and earnings guidance from June. We are proud to share today that we delivered on those revised commitments for the year, finishing 2017 with strong sales and business momentum.
 In 2017, we also grew digital sales by more than 90% and expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations. We gained market share for the 13th consecutive year, achieved $16.7 billion in annual natural and organic sales, including $2 billion in Simple Truth sales. We launched Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, our commitment to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate waste across our business by 2025, and created 10,000 new American jobs in our supermarket locations across the country. All of this is encouraging as we start 2018.
 Looking at 2018 and beyond, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a catalyst that will enable us to accelerate investments in Restock Kroger. And as we've shared a few times since the fall, we are taking a balanced approach to ensure tax reform benefits our associates, customers and shareholders. Shareholders will benefit from approximately 1/3 of the tax savings flowing through the net earnings per diluted share. For our customers, we'll make strategic investments to continue redefining the grocery customer experience through a combination of improved services, lower prices and added convenience. And for our associates, we are developing plans now to invest in long-term benefits, including education, wages and retirement. We are looking at ways to differentiate our associate experience with the underlying philosophy that we want to provide more than a onetime award. We want to make investments in our associates' future. As an example of this, we are doing a lot of work right now to develop an industry-leading education offering for associates. Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and save for a career. We believe an enhanced commitment to employee education will drive the Develop Talent focus area of our plan.
 These investments underpin and accelerate Restock Kroger, which means we fully expect a strong return from each. Sharing the benefits with our associates and customers will create a more sustainable and stronger business model to support Kroger's future. The investments are also aligned with our purpose, our promise and our values. We look forward to sharing more details on our plans with associates in the coming weeks.
 We continue to create a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us in-store and online. Whether through ClickList or home delivery, we continue to test, learn and scale what works using our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channels they choose when shopping with us.
 In the fourth quarter, we introduced a seamless digital shopping experience that fully integrates our ClickList experiences with our other digital services: coupons, recipes, rewards and more. After just a couple of months, we already know our customers love it. Customers are making purchases on the site at a higher frequency than before and spending more per online order. Households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not. And households that transact with us online spend even more. These results further validate our hypothesis, which has always been that customers want to have options for how they shop with us, and that hypothesis continues to shape our strategy to further accelerate our digital and e-commerce efforts. When you look at our customer coverage areas for seamless shopping, more than 2/3 of our customers, more than 40 million shoppers, have pickup and/or delivery available from Kroger. Our goal is for every customer to have access to our convenient services. In 2018, we will expand our digital coverage area and enhance our digital shopping experience to provide customers with relevant products, recipes, digital coupons, weekly ads, smart shopping lists and much more. To support this growth, we offer customers 1,091 pickup locations and more than 872 delivery locations across the country, and it continues to grow.
 Next, I'd like to discuss how we're winning with Our Brands, and this helps Kroger redefine the customer experience. Our Brands' performance this past year was extraordinary, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. 
 In 2017, Our Brands achieved its highest-ever unit share. We reached $20.9 billion in total sales and reached $2 billion in annual Simple Truth sales, which to me is even all the more remarkable when you consider that the brand is only 5 years old. We also announced a partnership with Fair Trade U.S.A. Simple Truth now offers more Fair Trade Certified products than any other private-label brand in the country. For the fourth quarter, Our Brands made up 29.5% of unit sales and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 I think it's incredibly easy to take this success for granted, but I've seen the energy our teams have put into creating the right items, and it's really a big deal that an independent third-party research has validated the progress that we've made. When you look at the results, they are extraordinary, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. The data is clear. Customers love Our Brands better than the national brands and better than other private-label offerings. Our Brands outperformed even the private-label brands you immediately think of as best in class. And we're going to shout about it so our customers who have yet to experience Our Brands no longer will miss out. We will be particularly focused on our top brands: Kroger, Private Selection and Simple Truth. Our customers will be treated to an amazing array of enticing our new brand product introductions throughout the year, an assortment that will add excitement and simplify -- simplicity to their lives, all at amazing prices. And Our Brands are only available at Kroger. This is why Our Brands play such a pivotal role in Restock Kroger.
 Restock Kroger is off to a great start. Our leadership team and associates are aligned behind that effort, which is further reinforced by our annual incentive plan. Customers are letting us know that they see, feel and appreciate our efforts to redefine the customer experience. And they continue to reward us with growing loyalty. This is the cycle that creates value for shareholders. We are confident that we will grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018, and we will create shareholder value by generating incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow over the next 3 years.
 Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results and discuss our 2018 guidance. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business.
 We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan. If you recall at the conference, we talked about $4 billion after dividends. This has been converted to a more conventional free dividend free cash flow calculation, so we're trying to be a little more conventional in the number we talk about. As you know, we've already reprioritized the way we invest capital over the next 3 years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost-savings opportunities across brick and mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments. 
 We're aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. A big focus will be on store productivity and waste. Both of these will benefit from the $9 billion in capital investment over the next 3 years. For example, store productivity will improve with the scheduled launch of Scan, Bag, Go in 400 new locations this year, and we are also pleased that Shrink continued its steady improvement throughout the year with good results in the fourth quarter.
 We plan to generate $400 million of incremental operating margin from 2018 to 2020. We are taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward to 2018, so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated.
 Turning to our results for the year. As you know, we revised our outlook in June to address the environment we're operating in. We've provided a narrow net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per diluted share, and we are pleased to have been near the top end of that range for the year. As you can imagine in a company our size, there are many moving parts in our operations. Our goal is to manage the business on at least an annual cycle period. This can lead to quarterly fluctuations, but we always have our eye firmly on annual results and the long-term strength of the company. We saw an opportunity at the beginning of the quarter to invest in the shopping experience and price while still delivering on our annual commitment. This is why our results reflected a gross profit rate decline of 31 basis points in the fourth quarter but only 19 basis points for the year. As a result of these investments, we saw growth in both households and total visits, unit growth and market share growth. Since 2000, we've invested -- we've reduced prices for our customers by $4.1 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit and ID sales growth while delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. This is the strategy we've been following for years, and it has served us well over time. It is a cornerstone of our Restock Kroger plan to invest more in redefining the shopping experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent that will be paid for by costs of good savings, strong IDs and productivity gains. This is where the incremental operating profit margin will come from over the next 3 years.
 We continue to make investments in our associates through both higher wages and additional hours for ClickList and other services. In fact, those 2 categories accounted for about half of the increase in OG&A in the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing from those investments.
 Despite higher inflation during the fourth quarter, LIFO turned out to be a tailwind due to lower inventory levels in departments most affected by higher inflation, primarily pharmacy. 
 Speaking specifically about ID sales, we're very pleased with the result of the 1.5% growth in the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed the company in the fourth quarter, including produce, deli fresh prepared, meat and seafood. Our Natural Foods Department continued to generate strong double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and full year. 18 of our 22 supermarket-operating divisions had positive IDs for the year as well, demonstrating the consistency of our results across the enterprise.
 Kroger's market share grew for the 13th year in a row in 2017. Our consistent market share gains drove both top and bottom line growth to generate lasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it: where do they spend their money? We use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It's also worth noting that market share is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales. According to IRI point-of-sale data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 21 basis points in 2017, a slight acceleration over last year's growth of 16 basis points based on IRI's calculations.
 Both our fourth quarter and full year results included several adjustment items described in Table 6 from this morning's press release. I want to spend a couple of minutes walking you through that table.
 These items are not included in our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share result of $0.63, and they are not included in our 2017 adjusted net earnings results of $2.04. So none of these items were included in our $0.63. I think there's a little confusion about that from some folks that some of these numbers might have been in there. As a result of the Tax Act, we recognized a tax benefit of $922 million in the fourth quarter. This was due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the reduction of our statutory income tax rate for the last few weeks of the fiscal year. As part of the company's annual review of goodwill balances in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $110 million related to our Kroger specialty pharmacy business. This is primarily due to lower rebates and gross margins that we built into our future expectations. Kroger specialty pharmacy continues to perform well.
 In the third quarter of 2017, certain assets and liabilities, primarily those related to our Convenience Store business, were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to these assets being classified as held for sale, these are no longer being depreciated. We benefited from this classification in both the fourth quarter of '17 and fiscal 2017 by not having to record the $19 million of depreciation associated with those assets.
 Our results were also affected by the previously announced settlement of obligations under the company-sponsored pension plan. We also made significant headway throughout the year, in fourth quarter in particular, on our long-term effort to address exposure in our pension plans while, at the same time, working with unions to provide Kroger associates with a more secure pension.
 During 2017, we proactively managed future risk in several ways. Most recently in December, Kroger and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters arrest -- announced the ratification of a new labor agreement that provided for Kroger's withdrawal from the Central States pension fund. We recognized a $351 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with this withdrawal. And subsequently, we've negotiated a lump-sum settlement for that, that I'll touch on in a moment. This was in addition to the $192 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 for the obligation associated with the planned withdrawal of Roundy's associates from the same fund and a $7 million charge for a separate multi-employer pension fund. As I said a minute ago, we made a lump-sum payment to Central States in the fourth quarter. This totaled $467 million pretax. This replaces what would have been an approximately $3 million per month pretax withdrawal obligation payment over the next 20 years.
 In the third quarter, we announced the $1 billion contribution to our company-sponsored pension plan. This funded a $502 million settlement charge accounted for in the fourth quarter for the termination of the cash balance company-sponsored pension plan that we previously announced. So we funded it in the third quarter, terminated it in the fourth quarter, which is why the charge occurred in the fourth quarter.
 Fuel performance was very good in the fourth quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.172 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.18 in the same quarter last year. For 2017, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.206 compared to $0.171 the year before. And average retail price of fuel for all of 2017 was $2.36 versus $2.10 in 2016.
 In February, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of our Convenience Store business to EG Group for $2.15 billion. Our Convenience Store business has been part of the company for many years, and I can't stress enough how important they have been to our -- to Kroger's success both the management and the associates at the store level and in the office. We have been impressed with EG Group's professionalism, commitment to people and understanding of the U.S. convenience retail market. We're very pleased EG Group plans to establish their North American headquarters in Cincinnati. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and we look forward to working with them closely to ensure a smooth transition for associates. As we've previously announced, we plan to use the proceeds of the sale to repurchase shares and lower our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio.
 Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We can generally balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. In 2017, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pretax to company-sponsored pension plans and 464 -- $467 million pretax to satisfy the withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund. We also repurchased 61 million common shares for $1.6 billion. We paid $444 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $270 million remaining, and our return on invested capital for 2017 on a 52-week basis was 12.03%. 
 We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we're bringing an off-balance-sheet item onto our balance sheet for funding an obligation already on our balance sheet like we did with the company plan. As a result, in the third quarter, we updated our target range for this ratio to 2.2 to 2.4x. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile has been reviewed. But since they weren't funded, they previously did not get picked up in the net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. The lump-sum settlement negotiated with the Central States Pension Fund in the fourth quarter is the most recent example of the company taking advantage of low interest rates and more favorable tax rates to secure the benefits -- the retirement benefits we promised to our associates. Because negotiating the settlement and bringing the obligation to our balance sheet was not contemplated when we updated our target last quarter, we're again updating our target range for this ratio to 2.3 to 2.5x. Just as in the past, this obligation has always been part of our credit profile. The funding in the fourth quarter now picks up this obligation in our net total debt amounts.
 Our current result of 2.6x on a 52-week basis is above this range, due primarily to the funding of the above-mentioned pension obligations. We expect to use free cash flow and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in this range. And as I said, this includes the sale of our Convenience Store business.
 Protecting associate and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. As we noted in this morning's press release, Kroger created 10,000 supermarket jobs in 2017. Through Restock Kroger, we are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. Our store associates in our Cincinnati/Dayton division are currently voting on a tentative agreement between Kroger and the UFCW. This will be our first contract under Restock Kroger, and it includes an added investment in wages, raising the starting pay to at least $10 an hour and accelerating rate progression to $11 per hour after 1 year of service. These are the kinds of things we contemplated when we allocated $500 million to the talent portion of our Restock Kroger plan.
 Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and the compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs that some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to our guidance for 2018. We expect 2019 -- 2018 identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 1.5% to 2%. We expect net earnings to range from $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion, and we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We're proud of how our team finished 2017, ending the year with positive momentum in sales and the overall business. We delivered the revised sales and earnings guidance we promised, gained market share for the 13th row -- year in a row, continued to grow our natural and organic food sales, grew digital sales by more than 90% and now offer a seamless digital experience to more than 40 million customers in America. And of course, we relaunched Restock Kroger. As we embark on our first full year of implementing Restock Kroger, we are committed to continuing this great momentum. And we will only accelerate our efforts to redefine the grocery customer experience through investments in digital, technology, pricing and convenience; to expand partnerships to create customer value by forming meaningful alliances with partners who share our commitment to putting the customer first; to develop talent by investing in our associate wages and education; and to live our purpose through our purpose and promise and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment. We are focused on these key drivers of Restock Kroger because we know when we execute them well, we will create shareholder value. We are encouraged at the start of 2018 and confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: So Rodney and Mike, I guess, the first thing I want to start with is on the gross margin because obviously that's the point, I think, that investors were probably most disappointed with this quarter. Can you just provide more color on what happened here? I mean, theoretically, you would have gotten a full quarter of the vendor initiative in Q4. Comparisons seemed a bit easier. It does seem like pockets of the country -- you're sort of hearing about things being at a minimum, not getting more promotional but actually probably getting a little bit better. Was the ramp in the price investment as aggressive as it looks? What's the thought process behind it? And then how do we think about all this for next year? Should we be extrapolating this gross margin down sort of like the way we saw in Q4? 
J. Schlotman: Well, relative to the last portion of your question, I think I would answer that the same way we answered the increase in the gross margin in the third quarter, that you should never really take any particular quarter and extrapolate it over any period of time other than that particular quarter. As I said in the prepared comments, yes, we were down 30-something basis points in the quarter but only 19 basis points in the year, which is a fairly normal kind of a reduction in investment in gross margins for us. I think that's more normal. We've been very open since October with Restock Kroger. When you look at the recent finds in the customer shopping experience key, that the investment in that key is going to be more than the dollars we generate from that, and that's going to be funded by other parts of it. There was a chart back in October that delineated how we expect to invest in the business and how we expect to generate revenue or EBITDA from those investments and leading to the $400 million increase in operating profit margin, just giving you a little more background than you maybe wanted of the journey we've been on since October. The short answer is you should expect gross margin to decline somewhat in 2018. We aren't giving guidance on the individual amounts. We've talked about the fact that 1/3 of the tax savings will be invested in the business, 1/3 will be invested in our associates and 1/3 will go to our bottom line. Obviously, those are below gross margin or operating -- that benefit to EPS is below the line, if you will. But again, we always try to balance to our annual expectations. 
W. McMullen: And one other -- a couple of things I would add to Mike's. Mike mentioned it, but we really focus on the gross margin overall for the year. When you look at the year and the work that we've done on Restock Kroger, we worked -- we are consistent with what we thought we would do with Restock Kroger. As I've said before, we're not going to lose on price, but we're not out there trying to lead the market down. And as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we committed to improving operating margin dollars by $400 million over the next 3 years. And we remain, as Mike said, to that expectation of ourselves and we would continue to expect to grow going forward. The way we will finance that is continuing to take costs out of the business through cost of goods, through process changes. Mike mentioned the improvement that we had on Shrink, for example, as well. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And just a follow-up as it pertains to reinvesting the tax since we're on that topic. Ever since I can remember from following you guys, the narrative has always been that your cost structure is uncompetitive because of unionization. Now it appears that the nonunionized players have to catch up. The thought process is maybe you should be spending a little bit less than what they are, but this actually doesn't seem to be the case. So could you just help us understand why your investment around the labor side actually kind of seems to be at a similar magnitude of what we're hearing around the rest of retail? 
W. McMullen: If you look at -- by far, and Mike mentioned it, the majority of our investment in labor has been in starting wages. And in the past, we've always had people very easily would come for a job and make it a career and understand, over time, there's wage progression. Over time, as jobs became very plentiful, that starting wage became more important. So we've meaningfully increased starting wages across the company. And a big chunk of the increase is there and the other huge chunk is the investment in labor that we're making on ClickList and the aggressive expansion and rollout of ClickList. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. And those 2 combined to be about half of the increase in the OG&A in the quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. 
Karen Short: I just wanted to clarify, first of all, did you give a tax dollar benefit amount before I ask my question? Because you didn't give one -- you didn't refute one on CNBC this morning, and it was $200 million. And I thought the dollars you were going to get was higher than that. 
J. Schlotman: Well, I will say that on CNBC this morning, that was a little bit all over the board. It didn't focus very much in the quarter. I actually didn't have a chance to respond to their number of $200 million, but it is higher than that. As we said in the prepared comments, we expect to invest 1/3 in the business, 1/3 for our associates and 1/3 in the bottom line. So in total, Karen, it's about $0.36, $0.37, somewhere in that range. So it's -- at the new tax rate, it takes about $11 million to pretax to have $0.01 a share. So it's somewhere around $400 million of benefit, and we're investing that 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. 
W. McMullen: And the investments we're making we've talked about in the call, we truly expect to return. And what it does -- what we did was accelerate some of the key parts of Restock Kroger. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. And we're moving some of them up so we can get the benefits sooner, and then the latter years won't be burdened by these investments because we've already taken care of them. 
Karen Short: Okay. So I guess that matters as it relates to your EPS. So when you look at your EPS guidance and you back in to EBIT, I guess, the numbers I get for EBIT for fiscal '18 or calendar '18 could be any -- down anywhere from 22 -- well, 15% to 22%. So I guess the first question I had on EBIT, is it fair to say that you'll be much more kind of at that low end in the first half given the accelerated D&A and then, I guess, the second half hopefully a little bit better? And then, I guess, what matters is what the core is doing because we can all take this $400 million and pay 2/3 of it, right? So 2/3 of that is part of the EBIT decline as opposed to the core decline, if that question makes sense. Is that the way to think about it? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I'm not going to get into giving guidance on what our EBIT's going to be. If you notice in our 8-K, we didn't give guidance on our operating profit margin, primarily because of the conversation you're having, Karen, trying to predict exactly where it's going to be when that's up above and I'm paying for some of my investments with tax savings dollars down below. We are balanced to try to make the numbers we talked about, and our incentive plan will only kick in, in a big way if we make the numbers we talked about relative to our earnings per share guidance. I mean, we've been talking since way back in September. We said it again in November and I've -- or in December, and I've said it multiple times when webcast since that we didn't see anything for this year that would cause us to be below $1.80 and we were striving to be equal or slightly above on adjusted 52-week year. Well, a 52-week year is the $1.95 and then above that plus the $0.12 is -- so we did the $1.95 as the anchor rather than the $1.80. And then the $0.10 to $0.12 from the tax savings plus being slightly above it is how we got to the $2.15. Estimates out there, it's probably the widest range that I can ever remember. This morning when I looked, the range of estimates for next year were from $1.84 to $2.40. So there's clearly confusion about exactly what the number was going to be and how the tax savings dollars were going to fall. 
Karen Short: Okay. But it is fair to say, though, the first half, you have a much higher D&A, right? So the decline will be greater in the first half, all else equal, than it will be in the second half? And I guess, then the other question is on the investments in price or wages, is any of that front-end loaded? Or is it pretty evenly distributed? 
J. Schlotman: The depreciation for book won't be affected by the immediate deduction availability under the Tax Act. That would add -- we'll deduct -- if I buy a 7-year piece of equipment for book, I'll depreciate it over 7 years. For tax, I get it immediately. So that won't grow my deferred tax liability balance back up after I reduced it. So the D&A -- immediate expensing of D&A is only for tax, not the book. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Question on what you've talked about in terms of tax reinvestment. I think you mentioned that some of it will go to educating employees. And if I'm hearing you right, it sounds like the implication is that maybe you have a pool of money that's going toward your associates, some of it toward cash bonuses and some of it toward this education. And I get that from a long-term perspective, right? I'm just curious in a tight labor market, do you have data that really shows you the right move to sort of not spend all of that on bonuses or on raises? I'm just curious, you talked about some markets being $10 or $11 per hour. I think Costco said the average wages of their employees is over $22. So just thinking about that balance and any data you have that can help us understand that would be helpful. 
W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of our average wage, it is significantly higher than any of the numbers that we've talked about. And the other thing, I think, always to remember is that in addition to our average wage, we also provide health care and pension benefits to associates after -- as a general rule full time or when they haven't been -- after they've been here for a little while. We were very focused on not having something that was a onetime bonus but what were the things that our associates told us that's important to them and what are the reasons that they come to work for us. And when you look at people earlier in their career, the ability to have flexible hours and the ability to continue with an education was something that they give us feedback that was very important to them. So we really view that, that is an important part of investing in our associates. And it's something that we believe, as our associates gain skill, they will be more productive in terms of their day-to-day influence on Kroger and also help them move from a job to a career with us. So for us, it was really important for it not just to be a onetime headline number, but what is something that our associates view as incredibly valuable and helpful over time, and that was an area where associates told us they were important. As all of us know, people are increasingly worrying about college debt and the debt they take on, and this in a small way will be helpful for our associates as well. 
J. Schlotman: So Ken, to be clear, none of our 1/3 -- of tax-saving investment in our associates will be in the form of a bonus. We just don't think that's long lasting and drives retention or drives employee morale over the long term. We think that's temporary, gets a big headline and is somewhat fleeting. And we're trying to make our investment in things that will drive retention and morale over the longer term. 
Kenneth Goldman: That's very helpful. Can I just ask a quick follow-up? Mike, I appreciate you not wanting to give some of the guidance items that you typically in the past would have given. But there are certain items that maybe are unaffected by tax, fuel gross profit per gallon assumption, LIFO assumption, maybe some color on the current quarter. Any help you could give with that would be appreciated. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't think we've typically given -- I guess we've given a range of margin per gallon. It's one of those things, Ken, we did make a conscious decision to skinny down the individual items we give guidance on. Because then every time it's -- the result's a little different than what you expect, that becomes the only talking point versus our promise is to deliver on Restock Kroger over the 3 years, to deliver the $6.5 billion of free cash flow, to deliver the $400 million in operating profit growth over the next 3 years; and as it relates to 2018 specifically, to have ID sales between 1.5% and 2% and earnings per share from $1.95 to $2.15. Every time we have to change one of those numbers in the 8-K, it becomes the talking point and sometimes the forest gets lost for the trees. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. 
Ben Bienvenu: Mike, I want to follow up on some comments -- or it could have been Rodney, some comments you made on the pull-forward of investments as it relates to Restock Kroger. My inference from the comment is that there's not also an associated pull-forward of the operating margin growth benefits that you would see as a result of those investments. So is it a correct interpretation of what you said to think that those benefits would accrue in years 2 and 3 of the plan versus concurrent with the pull-forward of investments in 2018? And to what extent is that to be reflected in your guidance? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you look at the way we even started talking about Restock Kroger back in October, it was always designed when you start looking at the numbers that -- and we have been giving guidance that our 2018 way back in September when we talked about not less than $1.80 and hopefully and we would strive to be flat to slightly above this year, the report of '17 numbers, it's pretty easy to assume that we weren't expecting operating margin dollar expansion with an earnings per share range like that. We've obviously updated it with the final results for this year, the final business plan for 2018 now completed as well as really good clarity on exactly how we're going to invest the tax savings dollars. The shorter answer is, yes, operating profit margin dollars will likely be down in 2018, and we're going to pull dollars forward out of '19 and '20 where the margin dollars should be higher. And we will pay for that for known, the known being the tax savings that are real dollars. And we are working diligently to deliver the savings dollars. We're pulling these dollars forward with real savings dollars that we effectively already have in the bank because of the lower tax dollars we're going to have to spend. This isn't designing a plan that's going to reduce Shrink by 10 basis points in 2018 and hope that -- I hate to use the word hope. I always quickly try to find a different one, but believing that we're going to be able to do that 10 basis point reduction and that was going to pay for our investments. From a cash flow standpoint, from an after-tax cash flow standpoint, we were absolutely neutral doing it this way. And it's going to benefit 2019 and 2020 when we make some of those investments this year, can still deliver the earnings per share growth and after-tax cash flow that we think we can deliver out of the plan. 
W. McMullen: And Ben, I don't know if this helps you. But one of the numbers Mike outlined in October was we expect cost reductions and savings of $4,450,000,000 over the next 3 years. That savings is what we would still expect. We have not included tax savings in that $4,450,000,000. And then if you look at what we plan to invest, the $4,450,000,000 that Mike talked about in October, our investment plan would still be the $4,450,000,000. We've just accelerated some of that into 98 -- or '08 where before it was an '09 or '10. 
J. Schlotman: '18 and '19. We moved it forward to '18 instead of '19 and '20. It's still -- we're still targeting the same numbers. We're still targeting the same operating profit margin growth at the end of 3 years, and we're still expecting the same free cash flow. And if you remember, on free cash flow, in fact, I talked about $6.5 billion. If you take what I talked about in October, it was $4.5 billion but that was reduced for $1.5 billion of dividends over the 3 years. So we've increased that by $500 million for some of the tax savings flowing into free cash flow. 
Ben Bienvenu: Okay. So just to summarize that, there's a pull-forward of the operating margin investments into this year versus what would have been over -- more steadily over 3 years, there's not a pull-forward of the operating growth, but it will be heavier in years 2 and 3 and paired with less operating margin investment in years 2 and 3? Is that the right way to think about it? 
J. Schlotman: Correct. And from an earnings per share standpoint, we're paying for that with a known increase in earnings per share from the lower tax rate. So we have to go out and figure out a lot of way to save. We know we're going to be able to pay for that from an earnings per share standpoint and a cash flow standpoint because these are real cash dollars with a lower tax payment. 
Ben Bienvenu: Awesome. And then a quick follow-up on freight. I didn't hear it mentioned in your comments. It's been a thematic touch point across the retail landscape over the last reporting period. To what extent is that impacting your gross margins? And how do you think about that cost pressure going forward? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We're pretty well protected on freight. Obviously, we have our own captive fleet that delivers products from our warehouses to our stores. We have a little bit of third-party there, but they're under contracts. A lot of our inbound freight is under contracts that are being honored, and those folks typically have a good supply of drivers. There is a little bit we do on the spot market, and we're subject to some of the disruptions in a somewhat minor way on that. Relative to third party, the CPG companies, there are a few of them that are having disruptions in some of their freight. We've been pretty firm and pretty much still invest there as it's not our issue because we agreed to pay a certain price for the product and their obligation is to get it to us for that price. And we'll see how that evolves over the rest of this year. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, a question. Tactically, the 1/3 that you're going to invest in people, how do you do that in the context of the unionized business and contracts, right? So contracts that might be up next year, the year after, is most of the investment in contracts coming up this year? How do you deal with the contracts that have yet to expire in terms of wages or benefits? 
W. McMullen: In some cases, you may end up doing a contract early. But as Mike mentioned, like in the Cincinnati contract, that was -- part of what was negotiated was to increase starting wages and increase the progression during the first year. And we've been doing that as contracts have been coming up during 2017. But it's a -- your question is a great one, and it's one of those where you actually sit down with each local and have that conversation. And you target those conversations with places where your starting wage needs to be adjusted. We don't have where the starting wage needs to be adjusted across every part of the country, just parts of the country. 
John Heinbockel: And the 1/3 that you would invest in the business, how much of that is price or promotion? And when you think about the draw forward on some of these investments, is the comp outlook -- in your mind, is the comp outlook better in '19 and '20 versus what it would have been if you hadn't done this? And you probably want to quantify that, but how much better? 
W. McMullen: If you look -- I'm going to broaden my answer a little broader than just your question. Certainly, as we look out to 2019 and 2020, we increasingly see opportunities for the business to grow in a reasonable way. And if you think about our investments that we've been making in our digital and seamless experiences, on a year-on-year basis, that continues to be a headwind. At some point, late next year or early 2020, that will end up becoming something that's a tailwind because of process changes that we've made on reducing the cost of doing stuff and the growth in the customer in terms of what they spend with us. So when you look at all the pieces that we have together, we really see that we're positioning the company to start growing again as you start looking out to '19 and '20 and starting it out proactively, doing it in a position of strength as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to ask -- just in terms of margins for 2018, just to be sure, in terms of freight, what level -- or do you have some cushion baked in for -- I know you said you're relatively protected with what you own and a lot of the contract that's not so much on the spot market. But do you have some level of an increase in freight costs baked in there? And then also just on the vendor negotiations, which was obviously more of a topic last quarter, should we look at that as a potential for ongoing opportunities? Or was it just because maybe more kind of came due at once last quarter and, over time, you really haven't seen any notable changes there? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say the performance -- the only time performance hasn't moved dramatically, defined amount was about the same in the fourth quarter as the third quarter. Relative to -- I won't get specific on transportation as a subset of my margin number. But as you can imagine in a company our size, pretty much everything we do is talked about in ranges. And then when we go to do our internal business plan, we pick a point estimate somewhere within that range. So pretty much everything has a range around it, just like transportation would be. And then you make a point estimate and put that into the model and you build everything else around it. And you move and tweak things to get to what we think is the right answer to strive for as a point estimate for the year. It's the reason we do earnings per share in a range. All of those kinds of things would result in the kind of range you see. 
W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of our team and the way we're partnering with our CPG partners on the vendor negotiation, there wouldn't have been any change in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And from a talent standpoint and the way we've -- what we're negotiating, we've supplemented our team by some talent that we recruited from outside of the company. So we feel really good about where we are. We really do continue to view our CPG relationships as partnerships, but we will use our data to make sure that we understand the strength of each brand and each brand within a category and, as we're renegotiating, use that as part of the negotiation. And in all the backdrop is our own brands, the strength of them continues to improve, and we have very high ratings on net promotability index on it as well. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, if I can. For the C-store sale, I'm guessing at this point, nothing's really kind of specifically incorporated into your '18 outlook. But of course, we do know as you said kind of repurchases and debt paydown are the main priorities with the use of proceeds. Should we think of it as more of kind of, all right, those kind of begin in 2Q and kind of incrementally are spread, let's say, evenly across the future quarters? Or should we expect kind of more early on? Just any comments on that would be helpful. 
J. Schlotman: I know it would be helpful, but I won't explain exactly what our strategy is for repurchasing shares. I did have the opportunity to read a couple of the quick analyst reports that came out as the release crossed the wire. And one thing I want to clear up is our guidance range that's out there of $1.95 to $2.15 is with or without the C-Store sale. We will use the proceeds to reduce shares, to replace the EBITDA that goes away with that transaction. I'm not going to talk about the EBITDA level right now. And we will use a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt to balance our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio out. So we built the plan so that whether we kept the C-Stores or sold the C-Stores, we would offset the lost EBITDA for the year by buying in shares, and then we'll use the rest to -- and other free cash flow to reduce debt to get our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio in balance. 
Operator: And that question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Maybe first on the guidance. I'm guessing you probably won't answer, but we're getting a lot of questions in terms of how to think about the seasonality of EPS growth this year. So anything you can qualitatively give us color in terms of how you think about first half or second half EPS growth. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. It's -- I would go back to the earlier question on margin per gallon of fuel and where we think that might be and things like that. We really do run our business over the course of a year. And frankly, we try to run it a little bit -- over a little bit longer time frame than a year. But we do try to make sure that we have guidance out there that's relevant and meaningful to investors. My long-winded answer is I'm not going to give you a quarterly cadence. We are in this for the long haul. A quarter is 12 weeks long most times; the first quarter, 16 weeks long. And trying to say every quarter is going to be exactly X or exactly Y, I can tell you they rarely wind up exactly at X or exactly Y. And that's why we make modifications throughout the year. Sometimes we may need a little more. Sometimes we have a little extra, and do we take some to the bottom line? Do we invest some more? And we're constantly balancing that throughout the year. And we really try to do that on a rolling year basis, not just when I get midway through the year, I'm only worried about the second half. We're already thinking about the first half of next year. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Then I guess, my real question for the call, so as you look at home delivery -- I know you guys recently expanded your partnership with Instacart at Ralphs. I was curious how that was going. And then just given some of their competitive developments out there, do you feel that as you look at where you guys are currently doing home delivery, that you need to accelerate your investment in this area going forward? 
W. McMullen: Well, as you know, if you go back a little over a year ago, we did home delivery almost in no stores, and now we're up to almost 900 stores. We would continue to look at home delivery as part of our offering. What we find is some customers like delivery, some customers like to have pickup and some customers like to go in store. And probably the most common thing is we find customers actually do all 3. And it just depends on what's going on in their life and whether they have a soccer practice to get to or from or whatever. So for us, you should expect to see us continually expanding the way customers can engage with us and do that digitally and with the mobile app. And we'll continue to make investments in those areas.
 Hopefully, from Mike's and my comments and stuff, you can tell that we're incredibly excited about the future of Kroger. And when you look at Restock Kroger, the pieces of Restock Kroger are coming together exactly the way we would have hoped and get excited about. Our customers continue to tell us we're doing a better job, and our associates tell us that they're having more fun serving our customers. So all those pieces are coming together, and we continue to invest for the future in terms of the way we think customers will want to engage in a retailer 5 years from now, not just today. So hopefully, you could feel that excitement from our comments.
 The other thing I'd like to do is just share a few additional comments with our associates listening in. Today, it's very fitting that it's International Women's Day. Kroger is proud to join organizations across the world to support and celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. This day is a great opportunity to live our purpose and demonstrate our values of diversity and inclusion by uplifting the women in our workplace. At our headquarters building in Cincinnati, we're joining with several other downtown companies in lighting up our building with the female symbol to celebrate women in business. And last night, we had it lit up, and it looked fabulous. I'd also want to encourage you to check out a video that we're sharing online both internally and externally that highlights several of our women executives. We are proud to be a workplace that works for women and to support their career aspirations and goals. This is what it really means to live our purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit.
 With St. Patrick's Day and a pretty big basketball tournament right around the corner, March is always fun and a fabulous celebration time of the year. I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities we have to uplift our customers and each other every day and to help our customers have great celebrations, great parties and a great experience in our stores and through our digital experiences. Thank you for what you do each and every day. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2017-11-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Kroger Co.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.
 At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. While there, we encourage you to visit the Events and Presentations page to find the full slide set outlining Restock Kroger as laid out at our Annual Investor Conference on October 11. Restock Kroger will be the framework we will be using over the next few years to clearly communicate how we plan to serve America through food inspiration and uplift and, as a result, create shareholder value.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
 With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 I'd like to thank you for joining us at our 2017 Investor Conference in New York last month where we outlined Restock Kroger, our plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats. Food retailing is more exciting than ever. More Americans identify as foodies and customers have more food choices than ever before.
 In the past, we have defined our market as share among traditional grocery stores. Today, we've redefined our market as share of stomach. This sharpens our focus when we look at our industry and our customers. We see anyone who sells food as competitors, which doubles the size of our market to $1.5 trillion. If you're eating, we want to serve you that meal. The fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households is an incredible competitive advantage.
 Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years because our touchstone has always been the customer. We place the customer at the center of everything we do. And because of our relentless focus on serving customers, Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner they turn to for meals.
 Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers: Redefine the grocery customer experience, expand partnerships to create customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. These pillars combined will create shareholder value. Going forward, I plan to highlight an item or 2 each quarter that we've made headway on.
 This quarter, I'd like to begin by talking about how we are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how they engage with us, in store and online. Our efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personalized, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs. 
 Seamless will play a major role in redefining the grocery customer experience. Our hypothesis has always been that our customers will want to have options on how they engage with us. This hypothesis shaped our strategy and we've been executing that strategy by accelerating Kroger's digital and e-commerce efforts for the last several years.
 We know that our customers have already decided they love ClickList, which is why we continue to rapidly expand that offering. By year's end, we will be serving customers at more than 1,000 click-and-collect locations. Our third quarter digital revenue growth was 109% driven by ClickList.
 We also know that some customers desire home delivery. We've gone from 0 to more than 300 locations offering home delivery in a span of a little over a year by partnering with service providers, including SCRIP, Roadie, Uber and others. We'll continue to build on our home delivery offering in 2018 with these partners as well as Instacart, who we are developing a unique relationship with. We have initially launched a partnership with them in Southern California. We'll continue to use our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channels they choose when shopping with us and we'll continue leveraging our physical proximity to our customers as a competitive differentiator.
 To do all of this requires the investment we outlined in Restock Kroger. Everything that we're seeing in our data and in customer behavior tells us Kroger's transition to seamless is working. Today, households that engage in our seamless offerings, engaging digitally and with our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not.
 The future looks even more promising. We'll continue to add even more services, expand our available product selection and more effectively use our insights to create a personalized experience that every customer will love. Winning in a seamless world also means optimizing space and ensuring our brick-and-mortar experience is curated to deliver exactly what customers are looking for.
 We firmly believe that customers of the future will continue to frequent physical stores with compelling offers and experiences. A very recent example of this is Kroger had our best-ever Black Friday results for general merchandise led by record sales at our Fred Meyer division.
 Another focus area on redefining the grocery customer experience is winning with Our Brands. It's no surprise that America's most beloved grocery store has some of America's most beloved brands, which, as a portfolio, we will continue to champion for growth. In fact, Our Brands as a stand-alone company would be in the top 1/3 of the Fortune 500.
 In the third quarter, Our Brands continued to deliver strong performance, making up 28.2% of unit sales and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to resonate in a big way with our customers with sales growing 19% in the third quarter.
 Another important Restock Kroger area is focused on accelerating cost of goods savings and sales leverage. We will continue to work on controlling costs to invest in areas that matter most to customers. For example, we are leveraging our relationship with suppliers to drive costs and inefficiencies out of our various businesses. These processes have successfully driven significant savings in cost of goods, which allow us to invest in price for our customers. At the same time, this helps our suppliers generate volume growth. Our use of data and science creates opportunities and efficiencies that both parties benefit from.
 Across the board, customers are recognizing our efforts to redefine the customer experience and they are rewarding us with their loyalty. This, in turn, creates value for our shareholders. That's exactly what Restock Kroger is designed to do. We will create shareholder value by generating incremental margin dollars and free cash flow over the next 3 years. As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our 2017 earnings guidance. We are also confident we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018.
 Now, here is Mike to share more details on our third quarter results and discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 and '18 guidance. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.
 Our core business was strong in the third quarter. We are very pleased with our ID sales exceeding 1% in the third quarter. We're especially happy to see the very strong performance in our fresh departments. The results in produce and meat were terrific and we continue to see double-digit growth in natural foods. Our ID sales results were driven by both higher spend per unit and strong growth in the number of households. Total visits continue to grow throughout the quarter and our market share was up. Our business is gaining momentum and our customers are recognizing the investments we are making.
 We noted at our investor conference that over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by $9 billion in capital investments, cost savings and free cash flow. We recognize that in order for -- in order to be there for our customers today and, more importantly, to be where they are going into the future, we need to make investments more aggressively and faster than ever before.
 We've already prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to those demands that were created through these investments. Then finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.
 As Rodney said earlier, we are aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. One example is our recent decision to require on-time and in-full delivery from suppliers. We're implementing penalties when scheduled deliveries are missed within a designated window. Over time, this will help keep costs down by ensuring more predictable operations, but more importantly, it will ensure that we have the products in our shelves that our customers want and when they want them.
 We expect Restock Kroger to generate $400 million in incremental operating profit margin over the 3 years from 2018 to 2020. We also expect to generate more than $4 billion of free cash flow after dividends over the next 3 years. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business.
 Fuel performance was also outstanding in the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.249 compared to $0.179 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.17 in the same quarter last year. This, along with our store -- our strong core business results, demonstrates the diversity of our earnings.
 The fuel performance in the quarter also created the opportunity for us to make an incremental $111 million contribution into our UFC Consolidated Pension Plan. Funding these obligations proactively over time demonstrates our ability to meet our commitment to protect employee pensions while simultaneously delivering value for shareholders.
 As you know, we announced last month our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our Convenience Store business, including a potential sale. This was a result of a review of assets that are potentially of more value outside the company than as part of Kroger. This process is ongoing and there has been a high level of interest.
 As we stressed last month, our Convenience Store management and associates are an important part of our success. We value what they do and thank them for continuing to put our Customer 1st everyday as we conduct this evaluation.
 Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion to company-sponsored pension plans, repurchased 59 million common shares for $1.7 billion, paid $446 million in dividends and invest $2.9 billion in capital. Our financial strategy is to use our financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders and maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.
 As of the end of the third quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $590 million remaining and return on invested capital for the third quarter on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 12.31%.
 Now, I'm going to spend a lot more time talking about pensions this quarter than I normally would. This is driven by not only what we've done this quarter, but also what we've been doing over the past several years.
 About a decade ago, we identified a great amount of exposure on pension plans and recognized then that we would need to begin addressing that exposure like we would any big endeavor, one step at a time. Our efforts began in earnest in 2011 when we negotiated and created the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. The keys for us were capping prior service costs, negotiating a new benefit accrual going forward, consolidating 4 plans into one and sharing both professional and more efficient management of the assets going forward. We agreed to plan -- to fund the plan over 5 years, but elected to fund it in January of 2012. This arrangement reduced Kroger's annual multiemployer pension expense and skewed -- secured the pension benefits for tens of thousands of Kroger associates.
 Including this agreement, we have since made more than $2.3 billion in payments and funding commitments with 2 objectives in mind: One, to address the underfunding in the company-sponsored pension plans; and 2, to address the liabilities of various troubled multiemployer pension plans. We have adopted this approach in a low-interest rate environment to provide greater stability for the pension benefits earned by thousands of Kroger associates and retirees and to manage this liability proactively or, frankly, to avoid kicking the can down the road.
 We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we are bringing an off-balance sheet item onto our balance sheet or funding an obligation already on our balance sheet. As a result, we are updating our target range for this ratio to 2.2x to 2.4x. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile's been reviewed, but since they weren't funded, did not get picked up in our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our current result of 2.57x is above this range. We expect to use free cash flow and potential proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in the range.
 Protecting associate and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. Kroger is currently hiring to fill 14,000 part-time and seasonal jobs. This is in addition to the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs we've already created in 2017. Through Restock Kroger, we plan to invest an incremental $500 million in human capital in wages, training and development over the next 3 years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.
 On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and we are currently negotiating an agreement with the Teamsters for the master agreement. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.
 Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates. The importance of growing our business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now for our guidance for the fourth quarter of '17 and all of '17. We expect fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we're already seeing that quarter-to-date. We expect fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth exceeding -- excluding fuel, to exceed 1.1%.
 We confirmed our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share and our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 a share. Both our GAAP and adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance includes the effect of the hurricanes. The low end of this range is $0.04 above where industry analyst consensus forecast had been, demonstrating Kroger's ability to deliver shareholder value in a dynamic transition year.
 Our LIFO expectation has been lowered to $60 million from $80 million and we expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2017.
 Before I turn it back to Rodney, I want to note that in the 8-K we filed earlier today, we reconfirmed our early thoughts on 2018. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.
 We are pleased with the third quarter results and the fourth quarter is off to a solid start. Our associates are providing friendly and fresh service to our customers in a seamless way.
 In addition to Restock Kroger, we outlined our investment thesis at the Investor Day last month and I'd like to share it with you again today because we feel like it really highlights our strengths. As America's growth -- grocer, we are growing in a fragmented market. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, leading to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, Kroger has been named America's most loved grocery store several times. We connect personally with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. And with Restock Kroger in place, we are confident in our ability to continue winning with customers, growing our business and creating shareholder value.
 Now, we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Karen Short from Barclays. 
Karen Short: I'm just trying to understand gross margins a little bit better. So Mike, you just said in the prepared remarks that you expect margins to moderate in the fourth quarter. And obviously, everyone was very surprised by the 30 basis point up gross margins this quarter. So, I guess, I'm wondering if you could just shed a little more light on what might have been transitory this quarter? 
J. Schlotman: What I talked about as far as moderation in margins in the fourth quarter was we expect our fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we've already been seeing that.
 What happened with gross margins this quarter, the 30 basis points without the fuel, ModernHEALTH and LIFO charge that we talked about in the earnings release, we have become significantly more diligent on lowering our cost of goods and negotiations with our vendors. Our sales mix was very strong in the quarter relative to more natural foods and more Our Brands, which helps drive our margin rate up, and those did offset continued price investments. Our costs -- our inflation at costs is still above our inflation at retail if you go back to the chart I used at the investor conference, but they are beginning to converge and both of them are now on positive territory. I don't want anybody to think we didn't invest in price in the quarter because we certainly did in a very big way and it's really the factors I talked about. 
Karen Short: So is it fair to say then this dynamic in terms of the -- being better at lowering cost of goods is something we should expect at least for the next 3 quarters? And then, in any way, you could just give what cost inflation was versus retail inflation? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't get into the habit of revisiting that chart. They were both over 0. So we did have cost inflation as well as retail price inflation that got passed on, but we didn't pass all of it on. I also won't get into the habit of predicting where gross margins may go on a quarter-to-quarter basis because you never know exactly what negotiations or what benefits may fall in a particular quarter, but we do feel good about the results we posted. 
Karen Short: Okay. Just one follow on. On the expenses because you did talk about multiemployer quite a bit, can -- any color on how to think about multiemployer expenses next year versus this year just directionally? 
J. Schlotman: As I sit here today, what I -- so there's 2 components of multiemployer expenses. There is one that we make on a cents per hour basis as part of our contracts to third party plans that we don't manage. We may be a trustee on those. So those will be whatever the hours we work in the contractual rate per hour. My guess is that you would see a slight increase, some increase in that number.
 I think as you think about contributions to our multiemployer -- to the UFCW plan that I talked about we created 5 years ago, as I sit here today, I would expect that to be slightly less next year than this year given the contribution we just made plus they are having a very nice year from a return on asset basis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser. 
Michael Lasser: So if the rate of gross margin that you saw in this quarter continues, would you use that as an opportunity to accelerate and deepen your price investments? And what are you seeing on the competitive environment as far as pricing at this point? 
W. McMullen: Well, one of the things that you've heard us say for a long time is we will not lose on price and we'll continue to use our data and insights to understand where we should be priced on a basket of goods and individual items. So we will continue using that data to influence and cause us to invest in pricing going forward.
 As you know, at our Investor Day, Mike outlined that, looking over the next 3 years, we would view over the next 3 years we'll aggressively continue to invest in price and we'll use the savings from all the things that Mike outlined to pay for those continued investments for our customers.
 I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything. 
J. Schlotman: No. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We have been and will continue to invest in price and we have a lot of plans in place to figure out ways to pay for that. 
Michael Lasser: Yes. And my follow-up question is if we did get a tax reform and your tax rate goes down significantly, how would you look to deploy that benefit to your P&L? Would you just let it flow to shareholders or would you look to subsidize investments you might make with that savings? 
W. McMullen: The one thing that -- first of all, we're very excited about where the tax reform is headed. We're especially excited about the House version because it starts almost immediately where the Senate is delayed a year. We believe it will also influence for us to continue to invest in our business, which will grow jobs. And I think what will end up happening is you'll see us do a balance of everything together, some of it our shareholders will benefit from, some of it our associates will benefit from and our customers will benefit from it as well because we really view that all of it together is what drives a sustainable business that continues improving over time. And as you know, that's been our strategy for a long period of time and we'd really look at this as an opportunity to continue to drive growing our business, creating jobs, being able to share some of that with our associates and customers as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So let me start, Rodney, Mike. I know it's harder to manage this balance than we think, right, between comps and margin improvement. How would you characterize the balance right now? Are you happy with the balance between the 2?
 And then, I know you said you won't lose on price. Do certain competitors out there, has that message gotten through such that some selective irrationality has dissipated? Or is that still going on? 
W. McMullen: The -- for us, I felt really good about the balance for the quarter, but I would broaden it a little broader than your example because I would also include cost controls. We're making some improvement on shrink and some other piece -- elements as well. So when I look at the overall balance, I felt good about what we were able to accomplish. At the same time, focusing on investing in some entry-level rates for our associates in several markets as well. The other thing that I liked about the balance for the quarter is it sets us up well going into the fourth quarter as well.
 On pricing, I remember years ago Joe Pichler told me, on economists, all short statements are wrong. And on the -- if you tell me what you want me to find, I think I can probably find it on pricing across the market. So we would not view that the market is any different today than it was 2 months ago, 5 months ago or whatever. It's really any more -- it's almost store-specific. It's not even market-specific in many cases. I was in a competitor the other day and 3 miles apart, the milk price and egg prices were over $1 per unit different. Sorry. 
John Heinbockel: And then, I was going to say, secondly, on ClickList, right, you haven't said how many you're going to open next year. What's your thinking in terms of how fast you want to go? Obviously, that's not -- with incremental customers, it's not that dilutive. Does that incline you to go faster if the organization can handle it?
 And then, is there anything differently you're going to do operationally next year with ClickList? Or I know at some point you may think about where the demand is, right, and how you handle that longer term, but do you do anything different operationally in terms of how you pick -- how you consolidate orders or pretty much it is what it is for '18? 
W. McMullen: Well, for '18, we haven't given a specific number. And I can tell you, internally we're actually still working on it as you look at the second half of the year. Obviously, in the first quarter and second quarter, we have those lined up.
 The -- we would continue to get ClickList in every store that we can do and that makes sense. We use our insights to understand in some places it just wouldn't make sense. There are some stores where we would like to have it, but we just don't have the physical space. So your -- one of the things you're trying to do is find the physical space.
 Operationally, today, we continue to see progress in our operational metrics as it matures and as we use technology to make it easier for our store teams. At the current volume, I don't see huge changes in approach, but that's one of the things that we're so excited about. Our online approach is at a certain point it's -- by far, the most effective way of doing it is in store, but if the volume becomes high enough, it's very easy to transition that over to dark stores and just tie it into our existing infrastructure. So we feel really good about where we are and we feel good about, as the volume changes, we can adjust the model to continue to connect.
 I don't know, Mike, did you want to... 
J. Schlotman: No. I agree with you and know -- and we obviously announced our relationship with Instacart that we have in Southern California, which will be a prime example of what Rodney said. We're, on average, smaller stores and smaller parking lots. And this is a great solution for a market like that where it's a service that customers want, but the physical assets we have wouldn't support it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: Yes. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the ClickList. I mean, you guys had over 500 stores, I believe, this time last year. Any color you can give us just in terms of how those stores have kind of ramped and performed over the last few quarters and just in terms of any contribution to the comp and how that's impacted margins? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It helps comps. From an expense standpoint, it's continuing to invest in the future. And as everybody's heard me talk about it before, everything that we have learned and seen on ClickList, it takes 3 to 5 years before we're really indifferent on a financial perspective of whether somebody comes into the store and shops or somebody shops ClickList. And obviously that's the labor that the customer provides on picking their groceries versus us picking it for them, but over time, we continue to grow the business and we get better operationally from an expense standpoint.
 So if you look at the quarter and if you look at year-on-year, it continues to be incrementally more investment from a P&L standpoint. It helps identicals. All the maturity that we're seeing on some of the early locations continues to have us feel comfortable that in a 3- to 5-year period for a store, you're really indifferent and it just becomes one more offer for the customer and that's really what we're focused on and we pay a lot of attention. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think it's incredibly critical to provide a seamless experience because the customer does still continue to come inside our stores. 
Shane Higgins: And are you seeing -- this progression, does it look similar to what you've seen at the Harris Teeter stores where, I believe, you guys have offered this or, prior to your acquisition of the company, they'd offered it for a number of years? 
W. McMullen: That's very, very much so. And as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter and we saw their insights, it's what caused us to aggressively start doing ClickList. And then, we think the only changes we made was asking the Harris Teeter team, if you had to do it over again, what would you differently? Those things we have done, but the patterns that we're seeing would be very similar to what we saw -- what Harris Teeter saw before we merged and what Harris Teeter continues to see. 
Shane Higgins: Great. And I just had a -- just a question, a housekeeping question on cost inflation. Mike, I might have missed it. Did you actually give a number for the cost inflation during the third quarter? 
J. Schlotman: About 50 basis points. 
Shane Higgins: 50? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, sir. 5-0. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. 
Edward Kelly: Rodney, can we just start with -- on the IDs, could you just kind of walk us through the cadence of the IDs through the quarter and then what you're seeing so far in Q4? I mean, your commentary around a better number than the 1.1% suggested, you're higher than that now, but I just -- your thoughts there would be good. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- if you look at it during the quarter, it was very balanced across the quarter, nothing that would jump out one way or the other. We had traffic growth throughout the quarter. If you look at the household growth and things like that, it was pretty consistent. And we continue to see that so far in the fourth quarter. It's a nice, steady balance moving in the right direction. 
Edward Kelly: So in Q4 so far, though, Rodney, are you above the 1.1%? Is that why you guide it that way? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you -- as you look day-to-day, it's hard to see, but we would be very similar to that. 
J. Schlotman: It certainly supports the guidance we gave. Right. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then, Mike, just a question on you on leverage ratio. So when you bring the math underfunding on balance sheet, the rating agencies obviously already know all this information and they've thought about this when they've looked at you in the past and assuming ratings. So does what you're doing at all have any impact on the way that you're thinking about allocating cash flow over time? 
J. Schlotman: It really doesn't. The -- as we have more opportunities and negotiate more opportunities, if I could get all of these union contracts, I probably wouldn't want to do it in one fell swoop. It's -- like I said in my prepared remarks, it's one step at a time on a big endeavor like this. I would prefer to bring them all on balance sheet, manage the assets myself, get rid of a lot of friction costs. One of the funds we consolidated -- and it was unbelievable the management fees that we're paying because their assets were so low. And as you get a bigger pool of assets going after the same goal, you obviously get better fees. So there's lots of ways that it's reduced our costs.
 And generally speaking, the rating agencies do get it and understand it. It's -- I'll think out loud just for a second and everybody in the room just kind of looked at me like "Uh-oh", but we've actually talked. Should we start talking about a leverage ratio closer to exactly how the rating agencies do it? So there isn't this disconnect between the 2,and we just put everything out there the way we believe they looked at it. They don't tell you everything, but -- and then, it's not volatile as it seems when we add something. So that's something we're kicking around just to take some of the what seems like a growth in our leverage when it's just moving it from one part to another. 
Edward Kelly: And just lastly for you, Mike. How do you see the allocation of the proceeds from the C-store sale sort of playing out related to repo or debt reduction? 
J. Schlotman: We'll -- I think I would just go back to what our strategy is and we would allocate our -- those proceeds to support all the pillars of our financial strategy, keeping in mind the contribution to the bottom line that those stores did generate as well as the need to get our leverage ratio down some. 
W. McMullen: It will be a balance between -- of all pieces. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I actually had a question on pharmacy. So there's been a lot of speculation lately with a new player potentially entering the pharmacy space and others such as CVS discussing plans to offer next-day delivery. So just curious whether pharmacy delivery is something your customers are requesting and your ability to potentially offer this convenience down the road and just the competitive dynamics just surrounding kind of this speculation. 
W. McMullen: Well, the -- in terms of delivery, we, in some places, we already offer delivery. The customer request is enough. Going forward, as it becomes something that's more important, we'll be able to leverage it on the infrastructure that we're putting in place for ClickList on delivery.
 The -- for us, one of the things that -- we like the pharmacy business. It continues to improve and grow because we're able to help people eat healthier as well. And our 84.51° and our pharmacy teams are really working hard. Our health and wellness team is really working hard on how do we help customers eat healthier on their terms because we know the flavor profiles people like. And we're actually doing some things now in testing with our associates. And once our associates give us feedback, then we'll expand and provide that to the customer as well. So we really feel good about the opportunity going forward by leveraging all the insights that we have. 
Erica Eiler: Okay. And then, just switching gears to the hurricanes during the quarter, are you able to quantify the comp lift you saw in the quarter? And any impact to earnings that you saw from the hurricanes? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the expense that we incurred did not penetrate our insurance deductible. So it was contained at less than the $26 million I spoke of last quarter. It was in the $20 million to $25 million range. And when you think about where the hurricanes hit and where we have stores, while it certainly helped the Houston division sales, the overall effect on the total company, given we have 2,800 stores and 100 or so affected in Texas by the storm, was relatively negligible to the overall number. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Mike, you said you were significantly more diligent, if I'm quoting you right, in lowering cost of vendors. And I have a couple questions about this. First, I'm just curious, can you provide some color on what this means in practical purposes? What have you done in terms of your negotiations with vendors that's working for you? And I'm talking prices, not just really fill rates.
 And then, second, the food at home industry, the manufacturers have much higher margins than the grocers. And usually in any supply chain, those higher-margin players have the leverage. But you and some of your competitors, you're doing things lately, you're pressing on prices. You're asking for better delivery times. You're demanding it, right? That kind of suggests your leverage is a little bit stronger than what I might have thought. Otherwise, I guess, your vendors would just say no. We won't pay these fees. We won't lower our prices. So forgive the long question, but does this imply that maybe because of more private label, whatever else you're doing to distinguish yourselves, that sort of power tide is shifting a little bit in favor of the retailers? Or is that... 
J. Schlotman: We've never really tried to look at it as a power struggle and we really appreciate the partnerships we have with our CPG suppliers.
 Relative to the fine to the late trucks, it doesn't do us any good to have folks around our warehouse expecting trucks to show up and the truck doesn't show up or that we have orders in for product from our stores and we get a truck from a supplier that doesn't have all of the goods on it we expected it to have on it. And not only are we incurring the cost at the warehouse for those idle workers, but it also winds up affecting sales when we can't fulfill the orders that our stores have asked for and then we can wind up with out of stocks or low stock inside the store. And it's really just trying to strengthen that relationship. If it's supposed to get here today and it's supposed to be a full truckload, you know, get it to us today and make it a full truckload. This isn't within minutes of a window. This is a relatively wide window at this point.
 And I would say the biggest thing on cost of goods is we've always, at the category manager level, done a really good job of negotiating cost of goods. There had been times when they've made decisions historically that somewhere up the chain in the company we may have overturned a decision they made, which causes them to think, "Well, somebody doesn't have my back when I negotiate really diligently and get us a better cost of goods on a product." I can tell you today, the category manager negotiates a price or a product in our store or not in our store. That decision stands there because they're the ones with all the data and information about how that decision is made. It's all of those decisions are made. We don't just do this, give us the best price or you're out of the store. It's all made with the powerful data of 84.51° behind it to understand consumer preferences and substitutability and things like that. So it's a pretty broad-based approach and I would say those 2 generally are the highlights. 
W. McMullen: We really do try to work with our partners on taking costs out of both of our systems and then giving that to the customer. We're very transparent in terms of the way we're negotiating and why we negotiate what we do. And the data, as Mike mentioned, is incredibly important to understand how does the customer view each item and what's the substitutability across items? And that's how we use what we do, but we do it in a very transparent way. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: I just wanted to talk about the fourth quarter and general merchandise, a little off topic here. But just wondering if I was going to go and buy a TV or something from Fred Meyer up in Seattle, can I get that delivered? In other words, can I buy it online and have it shipped to my home? I was on the website. It didn't seem like that ability was there and I just wanted to see if it is and I'm missing it, just kind of some sort of clarity. 
J. Schlotman: Our ship to home is an evolving process, Scott. And as we said in our conference call and in the prepared remarks, we had a record Black Friday and Fred Meyer had a record Black Friday. And when you talk about TVs, that's a record Black Friday relative to a few years ago where electronics would have been a huge part of their Black Fridays. And it's -- not every customer wants things delivered to their house. There's still a joy and excitement of going out and shopping for things and we'll continue to offer and, over time, offer more opportunities and options for our customers on how they want products delivered. But when you think about this year's Black Friday being a record year, I think folks claiming brick-and-mortar is dead and everything is going to get shipped to home are a little bit ahead of themselves. 
W. McMullen: The other thing, as we mentioned last month at the investor meeting, you have a certain amount of resources and we're doubling down on food and making sure that we're doing everything we can on food. We will start addressing things beyond just food. But first of all, we just wanted to make sure that we got food positioned appropriately so. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. So that is a good transition to my next comment because obviously store traffic for general merchandise was down quite a bit last holiday. It could be down quite a bit this holiday if some of the early numbers are verified. So, I guess, you guys called out the 1.1% comp. And, I guess, from an analyst perspective, when we just say Costco put up, adjusting for a calendar shift, a 7%, some of -- your largest competitor, Walmart, I think told us that their food comps are best they've seen in years and above their 2.7% that they reported. So, I guess, I'm just trying to understand, especially with the gross margins being up so much in the quarter, why your sales seem to be lagging in an economy that's just racing and how you guys want to frame -- would frame it? I mean, clearly, again, some traditional supermarkets are doing okay, but net-net on the entire economy, it doesn't look good at all. And I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that. 
W. McMullen: Well, as we mentioned in our call, overall in identicals, we felt good about the progress we continue to make. We continue to focus on improving that. Tonnage improved more than the number. As you know, as customers switch to our Own Brands, the retail price of that item is less as well. So there is some of those things that's within the numbers.
 Now, with that said, we are not satisfied with where our identicals are and we continue to push to improve our identicals from where we are and see a lot of exciting opportunities to do that. 
Scott Mushkin: And, Rodney, do you worry another -- the CEO of Hy-Vee was talking about maybe these big stores don't work. They've stopped going into Minneapolis, with their 90,000 to 105,000 and they're building actually 2 fulfillment centers, e-commerce fulfillment centers. Would you worry a little bit about the asset and that the center of the store is going to transition more and more online? And then, I'll yield. 
W. McMullen: Scott, yes. It's kind of fascinating. So far, if you look at our big stores, they continue to perform very, very well and our customers tell us they like them. Now, one of the things that's incredibly important is what you put inside of that store and how long does it take to shop the store and things like that. And what we have found is actually the flexibility of the store actually allows you to change it a lot. So if you look at how we use the inside of the space, we significantly allocate additional space for fresh departments today versus what we would have 2 or 3 or 4 years ago.
 It's -- in terms -- you started out your question, do you worry? I worry about everything. But what we're seeing is the customer continues to connect well with that format and what is really important for the customer is the ability to shop inside of a store when they want, the ability to pick up when they want and, in some cases, get it delivered. So it's really all those things together is what our customers are telling us and showing us.
 In certain parts of the store, the middle is declining, but I can tell you pets and some of those categories are continuing to have great growth. So you don't use the space the same as what used to use it either. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Prykull from Goldman Sachs. 
Christopher Prykull: Can you provide any more details as to how space optimization at the initial stores is progressing? And maybe specifically, how do you think about the sales elasticity of promotions in center store relative to perishables today versus maybe 3, 4, 5 years ago? And does that factor into your space optimization efforts and how you think about utilizing vendor allowances and price investments by category going forward? 
W. McMullen: The space optimization so far continues to make good progress. If you went to a store that's been changed, if you talk to our store teams, they would give you a whole list of things that they were surprised about what was done and they would also tell you, after they got used to it and the customer got used to it, they actually liked the changes. And there's as many things that's operationally focused as helping to have better variety stay in stock, some of those things for our customers. The allowances that a vendor would give us would not be something that would cause us to affect space optimization, but what -- obviously, we look at profitability by vendor, profitability by item. And whether you carry an item and things like that would be things that you would certainly be in negotiations with.
 On pricing elasticity, it really depends. Every store would actually have different pricing elasticity as every customer behaves differently. And it's one of the reasons why we think the 84.51° insights are so important and critical is being able to connect with that customer one-on-one versus a group. 
Christopher Prykull: Great. That's helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up to Scott's question. Can you give any further details as to how you envision your store footprint, both the size of the box and maybe the number longer term, particularly given your greater focus on share of stomach as opposed to traditional food at home as well as online? Does the look of a Kroger store evolve over time? 
W. McMullen: Well, the look of a Kroger store always evolves over time. And the other day, I was in one of our Marketplace stores that I think the store is 4, 5 years old and we just took a lot of this work from space optimization and put it into the store. So the store wasn't very old, but we made a lot of changes to it. So going forward, I would be -- I would totally expect that to continue to be the case.
 I believe when you look at -- going forward, you'll see a broader range of physical stores, but customer -- I think you'll continue to have all of the above because if you look at stores where we have a very developed ClickList, there are certain times where customers typically shop more than one of our stores. Sometimes, they'll shop a big store. Sometimes, they'll shop a small store and it really depends on their mission. And they'll use ClickList as well. So we would continue to believe that it's very important to have multiple size stores going forward. 
Christopher Prykull: Great. That's helpful. And then, just one housekeeping, if I could. I may have missed it in the 8-K, but as part of your fiscal '18 outlook, did you -- do you expect full year FIFO operating margin ex-fuel to be up or down? 
J. Schlotman: Didn't go there. 
Christopher Prykull: Got it. 
J. Schlotman: Just dollars, yes. 
Operator: And our final question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: Rodney, just thinking about some of the newer initiatives that were referenced in the press release, programs like info dining, private label flowers, apparel, I know they're not needle movers by any means, but I'm wondering if you could kind of take us through your thought process on why you've decided to allocate capital to these little areas as opposed to maybe partner up or acquire your way into some of these businesses, established brands? And then, I guess, inversely, I'm sure the capital demand is quite different, but why did you choose to partner on delivery when we know that controlling that relationship with the end customer is so important? 
W. McMullen: Yes. So for us, on delivery, the way that we've partnered, we still have the relationship with a customer and we decide which third party to deliver because the point that you made is the reason that we always want to make sure that the relationship stays with us versus a third party.
 In terms of -- on some of the other things, why we did it on our own versus partnering with somebody, we would always, when we decide to do something, evaluate and look at whether we should partner with someone or not. It's -- a lot of times, it's finding the right person to partner with and that's usually just as hard as anything else because you have to have somebody that really believes that 2 plus 2 will equal 5 or 10 or something and that you share accordingly and that's always hard to do. So we're always open and we will seek to partner with somebody when they will accelerate what we're doing. So if you think about some of the delivery things, those relationships, the reason we did it is it accelerated what we were able to do. So we're very open to third-party relationships, but it really has to be something that works for both. 
Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then, just lastly, I know you weren't willing to necessarily go there at the Analyst Day, but are you willing to disclose online sales in total at this point? It's nice to see the percentage gains, but they don't really tell us all that much.
 And then, Rodney, you used the phrase a unique relationship with Instacart. I'm not sure if I'm reading into that at all, but did you mean anything by that in terms of you having a different relationship with them versus other retailers? 
W. McMullen: The -- in terms of our overall digital business, at this point, we would not break out the dollars. It is becoming something that's reasonable in size, but -- and at some point in the future, we will be willing to break it out, but today, we just think -- don't think it's that helpful.
 In terms of the reason I said a unique relationship, it really was a relationship that we felt that works for us and works for Instacart and it allows both of us to grow our business. I don't know enough about their relationships with other retailers to be able to compare them, but for us, the thing that was really important was something but leveraged their experience in technology and people that leveraged our assets and we kept the relationship with the customer. So that was what we did and it was -- it's unique in terms of we really view that it will help both of us continue to grow our business.
 Before we end today's call, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in. To live our purpose pillar of Restock Kroger is what make -- what you make possible every day. By uplifting each other, our customers and our communities, Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan is our vision to end hunger in the communities we call home and eliminate waste across the company by 2025.
 Last week, the day before Thanksgiving, I had the good fortune to celebrate Friendsgiving with our Roundy's team in Wisconsin. I also had the chance to personally visit a couple of local food pantries plus a really cool, innovative mobile market. And the mobile market is a former NASCAR trailer converted into a fresh grocery store that goes twice a day to underserved neighborhoods around Milwaukee, really cool stuff, really cool partnership. And that's just one example. And as I have the opportunity to be with our team and seeing how much we do in just one division for so many people that's in need, it really takes my personal gratitude to a whole new level. I also happen to know that The Kroger Foundation just donated a brand-new truck to Feeding America Southwest Virginia food bank in our mid-Atlantic region. And it actually came complete with a big red bow for the holidays. I was equally impressed to learn that in only 24 hours on Giving Tuesday, our associates and customers helped us donate over 1 million meals through social media.
 The generosity of our associates and customers never ceases to amaze me and inspire me. It's just simply wonderful. This is what it really means to live our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit.
 Thank you for all you do each and every day. I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference call has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q2  (2017-09-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 Please save the date for our 2017 Investor Conference, which we will hold in New York on October 11. Details will be coming soon and we hope you can join us.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
 With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 As you know, Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years. Our success over time boils down to one thing: Our relentless focus on the customer. That focus allows us to deepen our connection with customers and create shareholder value. The customer remains the center of everything we do.
 The 4 core elements of our Customer 1st Strategy are as relevant today as they were when we first introduced them. How we invest each year to drive customer engagement changes regularly based on customers' changing needs and wants. This showed in our second quarter results as we returned to positive identical supermarket sales growth and both loyal and total households increased. Traffic was up, unit movement was up and market share was up. Our customers' perception of our prices is excellent and they continue to get even better.
 Based on our second quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we have confirmed our annual net earnings guidance. The operating environment will continue to be incredibly dynamic, but more importantly, customer behavior is changing faster than ever before.
 For the last few quarters, we've talked with you about our expanded view of all the food our customers eat and how we've been working to redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We know that the massive $1.5 trillion U.S. food market creates a unique and sustainable growth opportunity for Kroger. You'll see changes in the way we go to market as a leading indicator of the lens through which we view our market. We see anyone who sells food as competitors in the future.
 Kroger has a history of successfully evolving to meet our customers' changing needs because we put the customer at the center of everything we do. We are transforming today, too. We are reprioritizing and accelerating investments in our Customer 1st Strategy in order to anticipate and meet rapidly evolving consumer demands to shop with us for anything, anytime, anywhere.
 Our transformation is all about redefining the customer experience. As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance for 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018 as well.
 In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we've done for many years, but we'll no longer provide longer-term guidance. This will provide needed flexibility in how we invest to position us for the future success. We look forward to getting into the details of our goals and priorities at our upcoming Investor Conference in October.
 But in the meantime, I'd like to begin to create a vision by sharing several ways we are redefining the customer experience to be America's inspiration and destination for everything food. We're doing this by combining our knowledge of food and our ability to personalize through the use of data analytics. We're doubling down on digital and we're leveraging new and ongoing partnerships to deepen our connection with customers and drive revenue.
 I'll take a few moments to share more about each of these areas where we have deep credibility from our past and are aggressively developing for our future. Food retailing is more exciting than ever before, especially as more of us become foodies. Customers have nearly an unlimited number of options when you combine tastes, flavors and types of meals with the growing number of food outcomes that consumers are focused on. Those outcomes might include eating for health or for enjoyment, for example, or lifestyle or performance reasons.
 Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner our customers turn to for their meal needs because we know food and we know our customers better than anyone. Meals have always been our expertise. Kroger's often the one driving change and innovation behind the scenes. We are very proud of the role we played for over a decade in making natural and organic products more affordable and accessible to America, especially for shoppers on a budget. We've always believed that our customers shouldn't have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic.
 We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace. Today, Simple Truth is the biggest natural and organic brand in the country by volume. This market continues to provide a robust opportunity for Kroger.
 Similarly, our culinary innovation team is bringing truly affordable and an incredibly tasty meal kits to American households through our Prep+Pared offering. Just last week, we announced that we were expanding our offering of Prep+Pared to more than 50 stores in 3 of our divisions: Cincinnati, Louisville and Ralphs.
 Across Kroger, we know our customers better than anyone. We have a 13-year advantage of using data insights to connect with customers. Data analytics are fully integrated in our business as 84.51° helps us make merchandising, operations and marketing decisions. In the last year alone, Kroger has made more than 3 billion personalized recommendations to customers through product offerings, promotions, recipes and more.
 Data analytics is helping us win with our brands by identifying the best products to bring to market based on customer behavior and taste trends. Research by an independent third party shows us that our customers favor our brands over national brands and competitor offerings. The strength of our brands is what our customers realize Kroger quality is superior and at a very affordable price. It truly is quality without compromise. Kroger's customers get the best and most innovative quality at the best prices. We will build this momentum to be the premier private label destination in America.
 Combining our love of food with our data expertise allows us to offer content that inspires. We recently launched a new My Recipes feature on Kroger.com that serves up a personalized selection of suggested recipes. The recipes offer greater diversity of meal ideas, all based on your individual purchase behavior. Our growing collection of recipes is also searchable by a variety of filters, including seasonality, world cuisine, meal or dish type and cooking style.
 While online recipes are not new, serving them up on a personalized recipe for your family is, and customers and your family will love the new offerings, and this is distinctively Kroger. Personalized recipes are just one example of how we're bringing the combination of food and data together to create new and highly relevant customer experiences, especially through digital and e-commerce.
 Customers expect a great shopping experience and the ability to interact with us digitally or online in a seamless way. Our digital efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personal, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs. This includes our mobile app, for example, in addition to Vitacost.com, ClickList, ExpressLane and home delivery.
 Today, we have more than 25 million digital customer accounts. As we said in our press release, our total digital sales are up 126%, driven by ClickList. We operate more than 813 ClickList and ExpressLane locations, offering the convenience of online ordering and curbside pickup. By the end of the year, we will offer this service at more than 1,000 locations. Customers continue to respond exceptionally well to ClickList.
 We know that in the future, more customers will want the option of home delivery. So we are also testing various home delivery models with companies like Uber, Shyp and on our own in more than 150 stores. We will keep making these strategic investments to serve customers anything, anytime, anywhere in the near future.
 With new entrants in a fragmented market, we are also transforming our business and building partnerships to deepen our relationship with and create value for our customers. We've been preparing for new market entrants for years, and the fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households annually is a great strength when customers have more food choices than ever before.
 We continue to gain share in key categories like natural foods, produce and fresh prepared foods. We will continue to focus on growing our core business to generate free cash flow and deepen our personal connection with customers. These changes also create opportunities to work with our existing partners to deliver more value for customers and to identify new partnerships to create alternative revenue streams.
 Now, here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to walk through changes to our capital allocation process and long-term guidance. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.
 We're pleased with our second quarter results, especially the return to positive identical supermarket sales. That, combined with strong market share, tonnage growth and both loyal and total household growth, demonstrates our ability to evolve with the changing preferences of customers. Kroger has the team, the skills, the knowledge, the scale and data analytics to be a winner in food retailing.
 Another positive sign is that we had overall product cost inflation for the first time since 2015. As you know, the change from inflation to deflation and back again is one of the toughest environments to operate in for our stores, and we're proud of our team's ability to manage through it.
 Our Customer 1st Strategy has always guided our strategic investments to be there for our customers today and, more importantly, to where they are going in the future. To undergo the transformation Rodney discussed, we recognize that we need to make these Customer 1st investments more aggressively and faster than ever before.
 Like Rodney said earlier, we are eager to share the specific elements of our plan with you at our Investor Conference in October, but today, I will highlight 2 examples. First, 84.51° has helped us redefine space optimization for the entire store. As this comes to life, it will drive sales and operating profit growth. In the short run, there is a cost to doing this, but we feel the return is significant. This is another example of using 84.51° in new and innovative ways.
 Second, we're making sure we have the right products at the right cost and at the right retail prices for our customers. We are approaching these efforts, along with the areas Rodney outlined earlier, with even more focus and urgency than we have in the past. For example, we've already re-prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and by turning our capital allocation process upside down. We now look first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms.
 Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Then finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.
 One thing I want to be very clear on is that we are not talking about a new strategy to replace Customer 1st. We are talking about better executing the elements of our plan to deliver on all 4 keys for our customers. As Rodney said earlier, our customer remains our focus.
 We continue to see strong growth and amazing potential in our brands. During the second quarter, Our Brands sales grew more than national brands in our grocery, drug/GM and meat departments. Identical sales for Our Brands also outpaced identical supermarket sales. The second quarter brought strong sales and unit growth with Our Brands representing 27.7% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 All of this is consistent with the research we commissioned last year to give us an objective view on our brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private label foods. The research showed that the most loved brand sold on our stores are our brands, above even the national brands. And in the blind taste tests, our brands outperformed competitive national brand and other private label products.
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.217 compared to $0.198 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year.
 Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.37 compared to 2.11 during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the incremental repurchase of shares.
 Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.7 billion in common shares, paid $448 million in dividends, invest $3.1 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million.
 The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a key strength of our financial strategy. We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment-grade rating. We have reduced our 2017 and 2018 planned capital investments by a total of $600 million to maintain this balance and flexibility. Return on invested capital for the second quarter on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 12.37%.
 On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta and Dallas. We are currently negotiating an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in our Food 4 Less warehouse stores and with the Teamsters for the master agreement. This fall, we will begin negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia.
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and create more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of the year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we saw. Cost inflation trends for the second quarter were consistent by department with grocery, liquor, produce and meat all positive for the quarter. Deli was deflationary and pharmacy continues to be inflationary.
 We are confirming our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share. We are also confirming our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per share. Our LIFO expectation remains unchanged at $80 million. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 0.5% to 1% growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance does not include any effect from Hurricanes Harvey or Irma. Our insurance provides coverage and caps losses at $26 million for each event. Until the claim is finalized, it is difficult to provide an exact amount. And we expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for 2017.
 Now, I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.
 I'm often reminded of the saying, may you live in interesting times. These are interesting times in our industry. And I know some of you wonder how Kroger can continue to thrive in such a dynamic operating environment. We have a history of evolving to meet our customers' ever-changing needs. The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes. That is what we are doing today.
 Through innovation, Kroger is redefining the food and grocery customer experience based on our core strengths. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that competes -- combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, we've been named America's most beloved grocery store several times. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. And we have a track record of connecting with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives as evidenced by our team's response to Hurricane Harvey.
 Now, we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: Starting, I guess, with your guidance. I guess, what I'm trying to understand is, obviously, you maintained your earnings guidance, but you now have operating margins down 30 to 40 basis points versus the prior 20 to 30. So by my math, that's about $0.09 to earnings. And so, I guess, I'm wondering, just to clarify, the offset has to be below the line, unless I'm missing something? And I just had a follow-up on the operating margin guidance change. 
J. Schlotman: The benefit comes from multiple places throughout the income statement, Karen. There are efforts underway that will make the operating margin decline that you saw in the second quarter not as much in the third quarter. We feel very good about the health of the business today, the trend of ID sales, our efforts on cost of goods reductions and our efforts on productivity and operating cost reductions. And when we combine all of those, we feel comfortable with the $2 to $2.05. 
Karen Short: Okay, but within the change in the operating margin rate. So it's now down 30 to 40 basis points versus the prior 20 to 30. Can you maybe just talk then a little bit about where -- that was a first half event then and so we would already kind of seen that? Or is there more to come in terms of gross margin or operating expenses in the second half that were not kind of -- or we hadn't been previously contemplating? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I'm not going to go into every specific line of the income statement, but we are seeing good flow of cost of goods coming in and good cost savings opportunities in the back half of the year. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then, just one quick question. I guess, on Bloomberg, you indicated sales in the third quarter to-date were off to a nice start. I think that's what you said. Maybe can you get a little more granular, meaning are they at the high end of your second half guidance or a little more color there? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Currently, quarter-to-date, and this is without the hurricane effects, we would be above where we finished the second quarter and it would be closer to the high side of the guidance range. The reason we exclude the hurricane is because one day it's a positive, one day it's not because of, obviously, one day you'll have business that's up 100% or 200% and the next day it's basically 0. So we just -- until we get completely through the 2 hurricanes and when we release third quarter, we'll obviously give a lot more insight. But so far, we would be trending ahead of second quarter and closer to the top end of the range. 
J. Schlotman: And Houston is doing just fine. They have all but 2 stores back in operational and our warehouse is fully operational. 
Operator: And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.
 I apologize. That actually will be Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. 
Zachary Fadem: I want to follow-up on the ID sales. You mentioned the recent traction, but your second half guidance would imply that you actually narrowed the annual range by 30 to 40 basis points. So could you just talk about parts here, estimates, traffic trends and maybe walk through the decision to narrow that range rather than just holding it steady or taking up the low end? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Frankly, we talked about it a lot, and what our intention to do is really to take flat for the year off the table because we don't see that in the cards. We still clearly see 1% for the year in the cards and our intent was really to get the notion of flat off of the table. It may be confusing to people so far today, but that's what our intention was. We may not have done it as perfectly as we could have, but we still think the high end of the original annual guidance range is in the cards. But we don't believe flat is in the cards, which is why we wanted to take that off the table. 
W. McMullen: And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we'd left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant that we would have had positive -- negative identicals, excuse me, for the second half of the year. And obviously, we wanted to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect identicals to be positive. And the trends that we're seeing so far, the identicals continue to improve. 
Zachary Fadem: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And Mike, I also wanted to follow-up on the quarterly EPS cadence that you provided last quarter. Should we still anticipate EPS up slightly in Q3 and then flat in Q4, excluding the extra week? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We actually purposefully pulled the quarterly guidance cadence out of the earnings release in light of focusing more on an annual earnings per share target. I don't see any big alterations to that guidance that we had last quarter. Halfway through the year, you kind of have to wind up with those kinds of numbers to be in the $2 to $2.05 range anyway. 
Operator: And now, our next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So, Rodney, 2 strategic questions. Let me start with the space optimization project you're talking about. Sort of big picture and/or little picture, is that less center store, more fresh? Is it less brands, more private label? What are you doing there? And then, what are the -- are the costs simply labor costs to rearrange shelving and the like? 
W. McMullen: They -- in terms of how much it encompasses, it would be everything that you mentioned plus some. And as Mike mentioned in his comments on the space optimization, 84.51° is helping us look across the whole store and how do we use space. So obviously, in some cases, it's going to continue -- continuation of adding more fresh space. It's also -- in terms of the products that we offer to the customer, every single item has to earn its right to be on the shelf and categories have to earn the right to have a certain amount of allocation. So it's all of those things.
 The expense would really be driven by 2 things. One, when you make some changes, there's some equipment that you would write off. As you make the changes, there's certainly the labor in the cost in doing the changes, plus some of the equipment gets written off almost immediately. So it's both of those factors that is behind what Mike was mentioning. 
J. Schlotman: And if you move things around too much inside of a store, there's obviously disruption for a short period of time to the customers being able to easily navigate as we move a lot of shelving and things around. 
John Heinbockel: And then, secondly, when you talk about capital allocation -- and it sounds like you want to invest in existing stores more than new stores at this point. So what does that mean for your M&A philosophy? Does that suggest less of an appetite for M&A? Does it suggest more of an appetite for digital M&A and less brick-and-mortar? 
W. McMullen: The -- I would say the broad comment would be, from an M&A standpoint, we would be equally as excited today as 2 years ago when we find the right person to partner with. And as you know, when we look for someone to partner, we're looking at somebody that brings things to us as much as we bring to them.
 We would continue to be aggressively looking at anything digital that adds capabilities. You may recall in the past 1.5 years or so, we merged with a company called Market6 and another company called YOU Tech and we were able to use in both of those situations the 84.51° and accelerate the work that they did and accelerate some of the work that we're doing plus brought a great amount of talent to our company. So we would increasingly look -- are there certain capabilities that somebody would bring to us and how do you partner with them in a way that would bring that capability.
 But for the right merger opportunity, whether it's digital or physical, we would be as excited today as 2 years ago, but it would obviously have to be somebody that fit in well with where we operate and has a business that's strong. I don't know, Mike... 
J. Schlotman: I agree. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Two for me, if I can. Have you -- in your opinion, your competitors -- and I know it's very soon so maybe the answer is no, but have you seen anyone or have you yourself lowered any prices yet as a direct result of price changes at Whole Foods? And, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how your stores are doing the last couple weeks? It's not that Whole Foods necessarily has lowered prices that much, although arguably they have, it's just that there's been so much news about it. I'm just trying to get a sense of really what you're seeing so far in the marketplace. 
W. McMullen: Well, as you mentioned, Ken, it's only been 1.5 weeks. So it's very early in the process. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago on making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers. And we've never felt like just because something is natural and organic, you should charge a premium for it.
 In terms of the impact, obviously it's way early, but there isn't anything that would cause you to develop any point of view at all in terms of changing trends. But it's only been 1.5 weeks so I would caveat it a million different ways. 
Kenneth Goldman: It feels like it's been longer in my world. The second question... 
W. McMullen: Obviously, the discussion around it has been longer than that. 
Kenneth Goldman: Yes. Yes. It wasn't a very quiet August for many of us in this industry. I'm sure not for you either. 
W. McMullen: No. Right. 
Kenneth Goldman: Can I just follow-up on one thing? In terms of your guidance for the comps in the back half of the year, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on that because the business is doing, clearly, in some ways better, right? You're talking about comps being positive. You have positive tonnage, but the guidance does imply a fairly meaningful step down in the 2-year stack in comp in the back half. And I know there's many ways of looking at that, but that's one of the questions I've gotten from investors this morning. I just wanted to see if you had a comment on that, if you could sort of help us out understand why you're sort of thinking that comps will be a little bit maybe weaker on a 2-year level and maybe that means fundamentally weaker? Or is that not how you look at it? 
J. Schlotman: I don't think -- I actually don't look at 2-year stacks very much because I sold whatever I sold last year and I'm selling that plus more this year. And we feel very good about the underlying health of our business. As we said in the prepared remarks and in response to questions so far, ID sales so far in the quarter are pushing the high end of the guidance range. We grew loyal households. We grew total households. We had strong market share growth and strong tonnage growth. And I would also remind you that as our brands continue to gain strength and gain a bigger share of both units and sales, that comes at the expense of a lower retail ring, which winds up being a bit of a headwind to reported ID sales. And we are -- we have been very aggressive with how we position those products inside of our stores. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. 
Ben Bienvenu: On the digital revenue growth, pretty significant and obviously making progress there on the ClickList side. I'm curious, did that have any meaningful contribution to the comp that you reported in the quarter? 
W. McMullen: Well, it's a great question and it's hard to answer because the thing that we're trying to do for our customers is to do it in a way that's totally seamless. So the customer continues to come into the store and shop. So we actually get more of their total basket. So it's helping comps, but it's helping comps from that total customer household and how much they're spending with us. From a -- so it's helping identicals, but it's really hard to say ClickList is x percent of it or y percent of it.
 I don't know, Mike, anything you want to... 
J. Schlotman: No. It's clear that the customers love the service and it gives them an incremental connection with Kroger. And as Rodney said, it gives us a bigger share of their wallet the longer they're engaged in ClickList. 
Ben Bienvenu: Understood. And then, second question on the private label business. That's been a big success factor for you. Rodney, you've highlighted in some of your initial comments the customer perception of the brands that you offer under your corporate brand. I'm curious, as you think about the future opportunity, a, what is the magnitude of that opportunity as a percentage of sales? And then, b, how much capacity do you have for self-manufacturing to deliver on that higher penetration opportunity? 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll give a little bit broader answer than just your question. First of all, we would talk about it in terms of our brands versus private label because from -- and it's something that took us longer than it should have, but those brands, they are Our Brands and the customers tell us they love it. And one of the things that we probably should have done years ago, but we hadn't, but we actually was much more aggressive on hiring a third party company to do a broad taste -- taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other private -- other companies' private label programs. And we always thought we were good, but we came out even significantly better than what we would have even thought.
 So it really highlighted the progress that our team has been making on improving the innovation in our brands, the variety of offerings. If you look at Simple Truth, obviously, 5 years ago, it didn't exist. Today, it continues to grow double digits. So when you look at overall, our customers tell us they love our brands and we continue to even get more aggressive in terms of creating additional innovation brands, offerings within it, new flavors.
 In terms of the potential, at this point, the only thing that I would say is it would be massive. And one of the things that we did several years ago, we went to the outside and hired a new leader for that team and about half of our team is from the outside. And when you go and look at Europe, obviously, on our brand products in Europe, the market shares there are significantly higher than the U.S. And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level.
 In terms of our plant capacity, if you asked our manufacturing team, they would probably tell you they're at almost capacity. I've always found and we've always found that we always figure out ways to produce incremental product and do it very efficiently. So in terms of capacity, it is one of the great things about knowing how to operate plants. We could easily expand capacity either through process change or additional -- expanding plants, things like that, whatever's needed. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Rodney, Walmart -- you guys called out your great digital sales growth. And one thing is can we get digital as a percent of sales from you guys? 
W. McMullen: Not at this point. I don't know, Mike, if you -- not at this point. As you know, we're continuing to provide a little bit more insight than before, but... 
Robert Ohmes: Okay. So I'll keep pushing on that, but maybe in the future some time. But I was just going to ask, Walmart, obviously, is being really aggressive with the rollout of their version of ClickList. I was hoping you can maybe speak to us about where you're having crossover with them, sort of what the dynamic looks like because, I think, you 2 are being the most aggressive at going after this new way of grocery shopping.
 And then, the other question I had on competition, ALDI has been out there -- sorry, Lidl has been out there now a little bit longer than Amazon's owned Whole Foods. So maybe you could kind of update us on what you are seeing there. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On the crossover with Walmart on digital, I actually don't know the answer to that. Mike, do you? 
J. Schlotman: I don't know how many we overlap with. I do know that the thing that customers really appreciate about our offering is the fact that most of our customers live within a mile or 2 of the store. They shop and they can go pick the ClickList up offering in. So it's extremely convenient for them to engage in that kind of an activity and often use the [ in easy out ] and not all of our competitors have that advantage. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And it's incredibly easy to develop a shopping list with us, the work that our teams have done working with 84.51°. We do a lot of work on predicting what your shopping list will be to make it really easy to do. Like, one insight that I can give you, and I'll -- we'll have to go back and look to see what the overlap on Walmart is, our success on ClickList is very consistent across the country. You don't see one place where it's a 1% and somewhere else it's 100%. The variance of success is pretty consistent.
 On Lidl, obviously they continue to open stores. So far, what they've done has been pretty consistent with what we expected. And obviously, you've heard us talk about, from a pricing standpoint, we won't lose on price. We're not trying to lead the market down on price, but we're not going to lose on price.
 The success so far in terms of being able to maintain our business and grow our business, we feel very good about our -- the ability to compete against ALDI, Lidl and anybody else. So I wouldn't say there's been any surprises so far. Obviously, they're a great competitor, but there's a lot of great competitors out there. 
Robert Ohmes: And just last question. The lack of -- the move away from giving us long-term guidance. Is the ramp-up of ClickList a big piece of that, meaning does it really pressure store profitability in the short-term because you haven't -- is that how we should think about it? Is ClickList just great, but in the short-term, it's a real pressure on margins? 
W. McMullen: Well, as everybody on the call knows, we make our investment decisions in terms of what do we think is best for our business 3 to 5 years out and -- which, in turn, means what's best for our shareholders 3 to 5 years out. There is no doubt that ClickList is a headwind on earnings currently. And we've even continued to accelerate the speed in which we put ClickList in. So it's an incremental headwind. We feel very comfortable when you look at it over a 3- to 5-year period of time. Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList. Our associates obviously, in terms of being able to provide the service, will be glad and our shareholders will be glad. So we can clearly see where we're -- there's a path where we're indifferent on whether somebody comes into the store or shops with us on ClickList. It's -- you do have initial pain. And that would be a peek of caused us to affect the long-term guidance perspective. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. 
Mark Carden: This is Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser today. So you commented earlier that periods transitioning from deflation to inflation can lead to a challenging operating environment. And so given we saw food at home CPI turn inflationary again this quarter, can you comment on how the competitive environment has held up relative to your expectations? And by that, has it been different from past cycles or pretty much in line with what you've seen recently? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say it's fairly common or a fairly traditional kind of a transition. It's just that any time you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disrupted is how quickly will people lower prices. And then, the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust their prices the other direction to continue to protect their gross margin dollars that they would have in those products. And that's what causes the disruption in the short run as you're cycling through the 2 of those. I would say broad-based there isn't anything that's really out of the realm of what you normally see. The one exception to that would be what we talked about earlier in the year relative to some low milk prices earlier in the year and eggs continue to be pretty inexpensive as well, but those would probably be the only 2 categories that I would hold out as maybe exceptions to the norm right now. 
Mark Carden: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, a little bit more near-term, you mentioned that, with hurricanes, there's obviously some variability. One day you could see a benefit from stock-up trips while the next day you see a decline from closed stores. I guess, historically, have you seen this trend towards either a net benefit or a net loss? Or is it really just varied based on the storm? 
J. Schlotman: It really varies based on the storm. I would say, at the end of the day, there is probably -- it depends -- one, it depends how the insurance claim winds up getting reconciled. But from your business inside the store, there is usually a slight benefit. One of the things we've always done a great job at is being one of the first people fully back in business and being able to service our customers and the communities where we have our stores. And it's very important for those folks when if they've been evacuated and the local authorities lift the evacuation order, we have to be back in business for them or they're going to have a really big problem when they let folks come back into their homes. Many of those folks have lost product in their homes and they have to stock back up once they can get back in their homes. So there are just so many factors in it, but first and foremost, we try to be in it for our associates, our customers and our communities because they do need food to eat and we've always been there to provide it for them. 
W. McMullen: The other thing that's -- we have such great relationships with local agencies. Almost always, we would be considered part of the first responder group because people understand that it's important for the grocery stores to get stocked. So our associates would be given clearance as a first responder in most cases. 
J. Schlotman: Clearance to get to the store, often part of the first grids to come back on in power. There's a whole litany of things that -- before you come back from an evacuation, you have to get basic services up, you have to have food. And we typically always fall inside that and are there ready to help. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I also just wanted to touch on maybe some of the larger CPG players out there. We continue to see weakening trends from a number of the larger players. And I was just curious, as you look at your partnerships with them, are you at all starting to see more efforts by them in terms of maybe supporting their products in store or even maybe improving competitiveness? 
W. McMullen: Well, on CPGs, as you know, we always work with CPG partners trying to understand how we grow our business on a combined basis. So both of us are very focused on growing the business. I think CPGs continue to aggressively incrementally try to work on -- work with us on helping grow their business. It's one of the things that's nice about having the great insight we have with 84.51°. We partner with most CPGs in a different and more deep way that also involves product innovation. So there is no doubt there's a tremendous amount of change going on. The CPGs feel that change. And we're working with the CPGs for both of us to grow our business. But obviously, we're also working on focusing on growing our business as well. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And going back to maybe a question that was asked earlier on the promotional environment. Because it sounds like some of the items that were more promotional, eggs and milk, you continue to see pockets of increased promotions out there. But outside of that, how would you characterize the promotional environment versus what you were seeing earlier this year? 
W. McMullen: Outside of that, I really wouldn't say that it's -- there's been a massive trend change. What did they used to always say in economics, all short statements are wrong. So you give the scenario and I can find it somewhere. The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country. Everywhere else would be puts and takes. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: I just want to go back a little bit more to the overall pricing strategy, right? Obviously, kind of since last quarter, it's been a big topic for you guys. What is the 84.51° data telling you? Like, when you're making decisions in different geographies to either be a leader or a match or a close follower on pricing on some of these high-velocity items, is it kind of always the case that you kind of have to match it to keep that loyal customer? Or if they go somewhere else, how long does it take to get them back? And maybe just a little bit around the consumer behavior that the data is telling you. 
W. McMullen: The biggest thing that the 84.51° insight shows us is the customer decides where to shop based on the total experience. And obviously, that total experience is what's the shopping environment like. So what's -- how the associates treat the customer, what kind of rewards do you have, what type of personalized offers are you making, which it's very hard for anybody to see that other than each one of us as a customer individually, and then obviously, from a fresh product standpoint, having great produce, meat, deli, dinner tonight, those kind of things. So the thing that's really important is the -- all of that together. The price -- the specific price items -- really each one of us would have different items that are our biggest hot button. So it would be factoring in all of those things in terms of how we decide where to price and how to price. And the insights -- the biggest part of the insights is it really is important to customers for the over total experience, not just one dimensional of the experience. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up. Just going back to the maintained EPS guidance for the year. It would seem that, at least with 10 basis points lower margin, at least one of the larger offsetting factors would be from fuel. So maybe just any thoughts on the profitability on the fuel side for the back half of the year. And also, just I don't know, I might have missed it, but can you give us an inflation number as well for this quarter? 
J. Schlotman: What was the last part? You kind of tailed... 
Vincent Sinisi: Yes, the inflation for the quarter. 
J. Schlotman: So for fuel, it continues to be a strong year in fuel. And I don't want to play the hurricane card again, but obviously, refineries have been shut down. The Colonial Pipeline was shut down for a while. Supply has been tight in some places. So there will probably be some disruptions overall in the third quarter. We haul fuel from a lot of distant places to get -- to keep a lot of our stores in fuel. So I still think fuel had a relatively good back half of the year.
 Relative to inflation, I ticked off the categories that saw some inflation and deflation. We did have inflation for the first time ever. In the grocery category, it was -- probably it was 48 or 49 basis points of inflation, which is the biggest driver of where the overall business winds up going. And that's the first time in -- well, my sheet goes all the way back to third quarter of '14 in the grocery category, on a quarterly basis, that's the first time since the fourth quarter of '14 that we had any inflation in the grocery category. 
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Tanal: Just to better understand the reduction in the nonfuel operating margin guidance, is that more about gross margin or operating expenses versus sort of the initial thought process? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. What was your comment on the guidance of reducing the nonfuel operating margin? 
Stephen Tanal: Yes. Is the reduction more about gross margin being a little worse than initially thought or operating expenses being a bit higher? 
J. Schlotman: I don't know that we gave -- I'm unfamiliar with us having given guidance on operating margin for the back half of the year. 
W. McMullen: It's in the 8-K. 
J. Schlotman: It's in the 8-K? Okay. I got you. I was going to say we didn't talk about it in the -- on the call.
 It's the continuation of what we've seen. We do think from a dollar standpoint that we're going to continue -- that we'll start to see some strengthening of gross profit dollars and operating profit margin dollars as we go throughout the year. As ID sales continue to get stronger, that will help grow the dollars, which is obviously the most important thing to grow earnings per share by. And at the end of the day, we focus on the dollars, not the rate. 
Stephen Tanal: Okay. Fair enough. And just to follow-up on the milk and eggs comment, I think you might have mentioned just now sort of across the country, and I don't know that, that was consistent with sort of the last time I heard about that. Has it broadened out? Did I catch that right? And pursuant to that, were the price investments that you guys announced last quarter, do you feel like still they're already sufficient? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The milk and eggs, I didn't -- the comment I made, I didn't intend to infer that it changed anything from the first quarter in terms of broadening out or narrowing or anything on milk and eggs.
 Now, what was the second part of your question? 
Stephen Tanal: Second part is just around the price investments in those categories. Do you still feel pretty good about that? Or what you've done already, is that sufficient at this stage based on the geographies where you're seeing that pressure? 
W. McMullen: Well, I would just, I guess, I would broaden it we feel good about the pricing investments that we make. And based on what the customer's telling us, it continues to connect as we expected and we feel good about it when you look at everything in total. 
Stephen Tanal: Got it. And this is the last one, just on the inflation comment. Was that specific to groceries or to center store? Or was that kind of all-in applicable to IDs? And if not, could you give us sort of an all-in number? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the all-in number was ID sales, without inflation, without the pharmacy business, was about 60 basis points of inflation, so not a whole lot different than the grocery category. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: So nonfuel FIFO gross margins, excluding ModernHEALTH, were down about 30 basis points. That was a pretty good improvement versus the first quarter. Could you guys just walk us through some of the puts and takes of that decline? And is that more reflective of some moderation in the price investments? Is it private label mix? Just any color there would be great. 
J. Schlotman: I would say there would be 2 things that helped that. And one is the continued strength and growth of our brands, which, while it dampens the top line a little bit, comes at a better gross margin rate. And the second is we continue to do a great job on cost of goods and the input cost of that. And one of the things the CPGs partners like about the cost of goods investments is we do pass those on to the customers, but it does help strengthen the gross profit rate in dollars over time when you have the better cost of goods that are out there. 
W. McMullen: Also, in some of the cost -- operating cost categories, the second quarter trends improved versus the first quarter as well. 
Shane Higgins: And should we expect that to continue into the third quarter, that trend? 
J. Schlotman: I would think so. 
Shane Higgins: Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. I just had a bigger picture question on just -- obviously, the retail environment has been pretty challenging over the past year or 2. Do you guys anticipate any kind of acceleration in store closures from weaker competitors over the next year or 2 years? Not sure how much visibility you guys have into that, but if so, would you guys be prepared to maybe purchase any of these assets or locations, similar to what you did with Marsh? And how does your decision to pare back CapEx kind of play into that dynamic, if at all? 
W. McMullen: We feel very strongly that we would expect additional consolidation going forward. And the consolidation will happen the way you described plus other ways in terms of companies merging and other things. So we don't think there is any doubt that you'll continue to see a lot of consolidation.
 You've always heard us talk about on -- anything that happens, you should assume that we've looked at it. And if you look at what we did with Marsh, obviously those worked out really well for us because it's specific trade areas that we haven't been able to get into. And by buying some stores from somebody in that situation, you're able to get into trade areas and leverage all your existing infrastructure.
 Those we always like, but they're lumpy. So you won't have any for a couple of years, and then you'll have a whole bunch of them happen, but those are ones that we will always be interested in and always take a look at. But you should assume that our overall view on merging with somebody is the same and we continue to look at stuff. 
Operator: That final question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. Just curious about your natural and organic portfolio, the growth rate you're seeing there, what portion of your business it now represents. And related to that, what is your private label penetration in natural and organic? 
W. McMullen: If you look at natural and organics overall, it's over a $16 billion business for us on an annual basis. So obviously it's an important part of our business. It continues to grow strongly and we would continue to see a great opportunity in that space. We find more and more customers, for some items, they will purchase a natural or organic item. In other places, they will buy traditional items. And for us, what we try to do is we don't judge a customer on how they eat and we try to make sure we have what the customer wants at a great value.
 In terms of the share of market, if you -- it depends on how you define share of market. If you look at Simple Truth last year, it was, what, a $1.7 billion category for us. And they -- if you look at the $16 billion in total, that would obviously include some non-branded items and other items, so that would give you some insight in terms of share of market. If you look at grocery overall, grocery, typically on units, is close to 30%. So obviously there's still a lot of room to grow. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. And my follow-up is just on click-and-collect. Just curious what kind of penetration you've seen in stores that have had it longer? Where do you think that can go? And also how do the visits and basket compare to an in-store customer? 
W. McMullen: Yes. When you look at total, we get more of the customers' business and that's what we find -- the reason why we are so supportive and keep working on it.
 In terms of the share of business, at this point, we wouldn't give the specifics on stores and what percentage of their business is in ClickList. It's a reasonably wide range. And the range isn't driven by anything that is -- it's more specific stores. So I know one store that has a pretty high percentage. It's right off the interstate so that store has gained a lot of new customers because it's easy on and easy off the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store.
 For us, what we've tried to design is a business model that we know -- a certain percentage of business, it's more efficient to do it in store because of not having incremental asset investment. At the point in time that it grows, it's easily convert it to dark stores or a freestanding warehouse facility where you put in more automation. So what we've tried to do is design where we can support and partner and make money, and the customers will take it to whatever percentage of our business they take it, and we'll be there for them as they go. So we've really worked hard on having a model that's easily scalable and scalable in terms of what percent of penetration it becomes.
 Thanks to everyone on the call. Obviously, hopefully, you hear some of the comments that Mike and I are making. Kroger is playing to win. And the things that we do are what we believe will be best when you look out 3 to 5 years for our customers and associates. And what we've always found when we do both of those, that our shareholders are well-rewarded as well. And the business continues to generate great free cash flow and we have great opportunities in front of us.
 So -- and then, one other comment. As you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in. First of all, I'd like to send our well wishes to the people of Houston and especially members of our Kroger family whose lives have been turned upside down by the recent hurricane and its aftermath. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are now bracing for Hurricane Irma as well.
 Since the rains stopped in Houston, you have shown nothing can stop the strength, resilience and power of our amazing associates. Many of you stayed in or couldn't easily leave stores, distribution centers, plants and offices and stayed overnight and worked tirelessly to not only serve our customers, but to provide food and supplies to first responders and local shelters. As a company, we've sent nearly 2,800 semis packed with food, water and other critical supplies to the region. More than 350 individual associates from all corners of the country traveled to Houston to lend their hands to help uplift the community. Having a physical presence and truly being part of a community is always important. This is perhaps never more apparent than when you have natural disasters strike. You and our stores are a vital part of the communities we serve.
 What I'm most proud of is how you've taken care of each other, whether that's giving a hug to someone who needs it or traveling across the country to work side by side in reopening our stores and warehouse. We take care of each other. It's who we are. Each day, we open our doors and welcome our neighbors with true hospitality and generosity. And together, we make the world a better place. Thank you for all you do, in big ways and small ways, to Feed the Human Spirit. We are truly Kroger strong.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2017-06-15 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Kroger Co.'s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. 
 At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements.  We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.  A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. 
 As we all know, there is a lot of change in the food retail industry, both in terms of the operating environment and the competitive landscape. The best thing that we can do is to stay on the offense by continuing to focus on our customers, what they want and need today and what we anticipate they will want and need tomorrow, and executing our strategy. We continue to manage our business for the long term and to deliver earnings growth on a 3 to 5-year time horizon. 
 We are making meaningful investments in our digital and online growth. We believe that customers of the future will want to shop with us for anything, anytime and anywhere. In the first quarter, we saw more than 30% growth in new digital customers and a more than 30% increase in digital visits, with faster growth in mobile compared to last year. 
 We are also building on our personalization expertise to benefit our customers. An example of this is My Magazine, which delivers personalized content like recipes to loyal households based on their shopping behavior and interests. In fact, we delivered more than 6 million unique My Magazine offers in the first quarter alone. This also allows us to offer personalized lower prices to our loyal households in addition to low prices everyone can see. This is another example of how we leverage 84.51°'s expertise. 
 We are investing in our people. We are improving customer service by both increasing labor hours in certain areas and increasing starting wages in certain markets. Taken together, these steps will improve the customer experience and improve retention. I share these examples to demonstrate that we are laser-focused on providing our customers with the right value proposition. This is our Customer 1st promise, our commitment to provide friendly service, fresh foods and low prices every day, and this is what we will continue to do regardless of the external factors because it's what our customers deserve, and we know, ultimately, that delivers shareholder value. 
 These investments both maintain and enhance our position in our markets. And while it is still early in 2017, we are starting to see some traction. We are happy with the better identical sales trends in this first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, and we are pleased to see that our current identical sales trends is positive. The last 9 weeks of the first quarter were positive, and so are our second quarter to date. 
 Our teams continue to innovate in new and exciting ways that reflect where our customers are going. Recognizing the demand for convenience, high quality and best value, Kroger's culinary development team watched an incredible collection of Prep + Pared meal kits that we are currently piloting in Cincinnati stores. We can hardly keep them on the shelves, and it's easy to see why as soon as you try them. Kroger’s Prep + Pared meal kits offer restaurant-quality meals that are easy to cook in about 20 minutes. We think customers will love knowing that they're available in their stores when they are wondering along about 2:00 in the afternoon what's for dinner. 
 Our brands are one of the primary means we have to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Last year, we commissioned an independent third party to conduct research that would give us an objective view of how our customers view our brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private-label foods. Our research showed that the most loved brands sold in our stores are our brands, above even the national brands. And in the blind taste test, our brands outperformed competitive national brands and other private-label products almost 100% of the time. Our products in Private Selection, Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands rated significantly above their respective competitive offerings. 
 Of course, our journey is never done. So our customers will continue to see rising quality and better value on our brand products in the future. By having brands our customers love that are only available from us, we gain loyalty and advocacy from our customers. Our brands represented approximately 28% of total units sold and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy during the first quarter. 
 Our customer needs are constantly changing. What doesn't change is the desire for welcoming customer experience with an abundant variety of food available when and how they want it all at a great value. That's why we regularly evolve the execution of our Customer 1st strategy, while the core strategy itself doesn't change. Too often, American consumers have to make a choice between low prices and a great experience, compromising one for the other. Kroger is uniquely situated to eliminate the need for the compromise, serving customers who are hungry for more than food, who want to be nourished in ways that help them live their lives best. 
 Kroger's purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit, and we are more confident than ever that by living our purpose and delivering our Customer 1st promise, we'll deliver long-term shareholder value that you can count on. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. And here is Mike to go into more details on our first quarter results. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Like Rodney said, we were glad to see the better results compared to the fourth quarter for identical food store sales, and for the second quarter to date, our ID sales are positive. 
 Tonnage continued to be positive during the first quarter. We continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products as well as areas where we are serving -- saving customers time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions. Visits per household were flat in the first quarter. Basket size and price per unit were down, but those were offset by household growth. Loyal households grew 3.2% compared to last year's first quarter and our loyal households had positive ID sales growth in the first quarter. 
 In the first quarter, our gross margin was down, operating costs were up and FIFO operating profit was down. While this is not representative of our typical expectations, it is important to keep in mind that we're making very deliberate and targeted investments in line with our Customer 1st Strategy. As Rodney outlined earlier, we have made conscious decisions to increase starting wages in certain markets to improve associate engagement and retention that will create a better experience for our customers. 
 We continue to invest and grow our digital business. Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year. This includes revenue from ClickList, Harris Teeter's ExpressLane and Vitacost.com. 
 As we continue to invest in price, we also remind you, Kroger's investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at gross margins in the early 2000s compared to today. Kroger has invested more than $3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers over that time period. We have no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices. These investments enable us to connect with our customers in a deeper way and increase our market share over time. 
 We are pleased that Kroger's market share, as traditionally calculated, was up in the first quarter. That said, we recognize there is no perfect metric for capturing market share. We are doing a lot of work to better define or perhaps redefine the market as a share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We see food as a massive $1.5 trillion market and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market. I also want to stress that we're committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales. Many of the things we are doing to pull costs out of the business today set us up for savings in the future. We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts. 
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.171 compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.33x compared to 2.12x during the same period last year. This resolve (sic) [ result ] is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.5 billion in common shares, paid $438 million in dividends, invest $3.4 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy.  We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment-grade rating. 
 Return on invested capital for the first quarter on a rolling 4-quarters basis was 12.75%. On the labor relations front, we are currently negotiating agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Dallas and our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors don't face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We have previously indicated that the environment during the first half of this year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we are seeing. As Rodney said, there is a lot of change in the retail food industry. That, coupled with the transition from deflation to inflation, creates a challenging operating environment. The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel. Grocery was essentially flat during the quarter, but had fluctuations up and down during it. Meat continued its deflationary trends. And produce, while deflationary for the quarter, showed inflation in the last 4 weeks of the quarter, and pharmacy was inflationary. As a result, we increased our expectations for LIFO to $80 million, a $55 million increase over our initial expectations. 
 We have also made some incremental investments in price in certain markets that had very hot features on milk and eggs. While this affects gross margin in the short term, it is less expensive than regaining a customer's loyalty later on. These 2, plus the incremental investments in hours and wages, are the primary factors causing us to lower our guidance for the year. Our GAAP net earnings per diluted share guidance for 53 weeks is now $1.74 to $1.79. Our adjusted net earnings guidance range is $2 to $2.05. The previous adjusted net earnings guidance range was $2.21 to $2.25. See the Form 8-K we filed this morning for additional information on guidance. 
 Because this is an unusual year, we're going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compare it to our long-term guidance rate as we've done in the past. For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the second quarter to be down compared to last year, the third quarter to be up slightly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be flat excluding the 53rd week. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to be flat to 1% growth for 2017, and we continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Over the long term, we remain committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
 Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are making the investments necessary to continue being the best food retailer in the country. We know there is a lot of upheaval in the food retail industry. Our strategy is to focus on our customers. As their wants and needs change, we'll be right there with them. We are confident that we will continue winning with our people, our food and the customer experience, and we will not lose on price. Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So guys, just to start off, if you think -- is there any way to quantify, maybe directionally, the investments in labor, in SG&A versus the investments in price? Labor being some multiples of the investment in price or maybe it's equally split. And then when you think about the investments in price, is a lot of that proactive on your part? You talked about dairy. Or is that more reactive given what competition is doing? 
W. McMullen: I'll start, and Mike, just fill in. On the mix between labor and price as you look forward, I would think it's probably pretty close to 50-50, plus or minus 10%. In terms of price, there would be -- as you know, we would not be leading on price as a strategy, but we're not going to let somebody have price. Now if you look at some of the competitive changes and what we see going on in those situations, we would be proactive versus reactive. And then Mike, anything you want to add to both of those comments? 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. And the whole trick here, John, is just how quickly the lines cross and our price investment create more gross profit margin dollars. And as we said in the prepared remarks, there's really 2 things relative to the labor. One is adding some hours to certain service departments, as well as increasing starting wages, which we believe over time will reduce our turnover, which has a great payback when we can have a higher retention of our associates who then are more productive and give a better shopping experience. So that one has a little bit longer runway relative to when we see the benefits of those investments. 
John Heinbockel: And then as a follow-up, if you think about what's different versus March, is it primarily the cadence of reflation? And then as you think about -- because it does sound like you do expect higher inflation this year than you had before, you didn't reflect that in your comp. Is that just higher cost inflation offset by price investments gets you kind of to a 0 net impact from that? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The biggest thing, if you look in terms of anticipation of identical sales going forward and the improvement of that, we would expect that improvement will continue, but the improvement will be a little bit slower than what we had expected. From an inflation standpoint, Mike went into a little bit of detail on LIFO, but that would be a big chunk. Obviously, the change in LIFO affected, I think -- what, Mike, about $0.04 a share as well. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Kind of around $0.035, $0.04, in that range. John, it's not necessarily that it's dramatically different today than we were expecting. But when we look forward based on the movements we're seeing in the underlying commodities, we do think there could be a little more inflation by the end of the year than we originally thought. But the accounting convention is whatever your year-end estimate is, you expense that ratably throughout the year. So it's really more reflective of where we think the end of the year is going to be, not necessarily what would happen in the first quarter, but we're required to ratably expense that over the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. 
Karen Short: A couple of questions. I guess in general, since you're taking the opportunity to lower guidance, I guess I have 2 questions. One is, why not take the opportunity to widen the range to give yourself a little more wiggle room? But I guess more importantly, why wouldn't you lower guidance more? Because if I look at your revised guidance, I still would say this seems pretty optimistic, especially given the competitive landscape has only really just begun to heat up. And within your guidance, originally, there was some assumption that there would be operating expense opportunities, and it now sounds like that's off the table, which makes me even more confused about how we get to the full year numbers. 
J. Schlotman: We talked about all of those in deciding exactly where to set the guidance range. We spent a lot of time taking where we are today, looking at forecasts for the rest of the year, trying to understand the gives and takes, and settled on the $2 to $2.05. A wider range, perhaps we could have done that. I don't -- other than -- the only answer I have to that is we decided that we feel good about the range we've put out there. We do feel good about the traction we're getting in ID sales that we think will help us support that ID guidance range. Relative to the operating cost reductions, I think that -- I don't have any concern that we aren't going to continue to get the operating cost reductions we're getting. We have made an independent decision to add some service hours to some departments, as well as in some markets, increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have, which hurts the customer experience as well as creates its own cost and friction when you're constantly hiring and training people. We didn't do that across the country, it's in select markets. But it's not an inexpensive proposition. So we try to factor all those in. In fact, what we call enabler savings are actually pretty close to tracking to exactly what we expected in total to save on our cost-savings initiatives for the year. 
W. McMullen: A couple of other things, Karen, too, and Mike and I both mentioned it. Our identical sales continue to improve, and we would expect that trend to continue. If you look at quarter-to-date and realize it's only 3 weeks plus a few days, we would be at higher than the midpoint of the range that we gave for the year, and that's continued to improve over the first quarter, and the first quarter was an improvement over the fourth quarter and it improved during the quarter. And then Mike's point on expenses, there were some items where it's more of a onetime type of expense item. If you look at some of the changes and the logistics in some other places, we would expect, as we get throughout the year, that some of the investments we've made, it'll flip. So you won't have the start-up costs. And then if you look at digital, obviously, you have a lot of start-up costs initially when you turn on digital in a store. And if you look at the maturity of those stores, over time, that becomes a headwind versus -- a tailwind versus a headwind. 
Karen Short: Okay. But just so I understand, in terms of the operating expenses reductions that you've identified, that -- we did not see any of that really in this quarter, but we will see more in the second, third and fourth? 
J. Schlotman: I would say we saw some in this quarter. And our -- what we have saved in the quarter and the runway -- run rate we have for the year is right in line with what our original expectation and our business plan is. There were other, as I said, the hours and the dollars investment in starting wages were something that was incremental to the plan, but we think it's proven to do that. We try to run the business dynamically and not sit back and say, "Well, it's not in the plan. So even though we think it's good, we're not going to do it." And sometimes, those are pluses, and sometimes, those are minuses. The investments we made in milk and eggs did not lose the customers to people trying to draw our customers into the store. It was -- that, by itself, if milk and eggs were normal kinds of retails, then we probably would've had positive IDs in the first quarter, not negative, which also affected gross margins in the first quarter. So there's always gives and takes. But the thing we're trying to get across is we've made some conscious decisions to make incremental investments in our Customer 1st Strategy, plus the effect of a $0.04 higher LIFO charge. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. 
Zachary Fadem: Is there any color you can provide on the ID sales impact from digital orders at this point? I believe you mentioned you doubled your digital sales. So when looking at your data, how are you thinking about what's incremental versus what might be coming at the expense of in-store volumes? 
W. McMullen: It's a great question, Zach, and it's one of those that's always hard to answer because you don't know what a customer would have done. The best we can tell, if you would give a range of between 40% to 60%, you're probably within that range. But it is a hard, hard number to guesstimate because you really don't know for sure. 
J. Schlotman: [ 60%. ] 
W. McMullen: Incremental or you would have gotten anyway, either way. 
Zachary Fadem: 40% to 60% incremental, you said? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. It is clear that those ClickList customers spend incremental dollars with us. To put your finger in the exact number, would they have grown their loyalty with us without ClickList? Perhaps. But you try to take the household trends as a whole and see where they've been going and where they are today. 
Zachary Fadem: And is it large enough to say that it's having a meaningful impact on the ID sales line yet? 
W. McMullen: Not when you look at the total. The cost of the start-up would be a lot more painful than the tailwind from it. But if -- as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter, Harris Teeter had been doing it for 10 years. And when you look at the maturity that we're having with the Kroger versus the maturity that Harris Teeter had, the maturity would be very similar, but it's a headwind for a while. 
Zachary Fadem: Okay. And I also wanted to address the headlines around Aldi and Lidl. Conceptually, how do you think about the role of the hard discounters in the U.S. and how that compares relative to the U.K? And in your mind, what are the structural differences between the 2 markets that you'd call out? And given that, do you think that those guys would have the same competitive advantages here versus the U.K. market? Any thoughts on that? 
W. McMullen: Yes, Zach, I love the question. A couple of things, for sure. One, just obviously the sheer size of the countries are different. I think the biggest structural, I guess, 2 big structural differences, if you look at the cost that it takes to operate a supermarket in the U.S, it's meaningfully less than the U.K. If you look at the price spreads that they're able to achieve in the U.K. versus the U.S., the price spread isn't as much either. So you have, both from a cost standpoint and a retail advantage for the customer standpoint, not as big a spread. Also if you look at the base experience of a supermarket in the U.S, we would typically offer more services in terms of every store would have a butcher that's there, ready to help. The produce would be much more variety, fresher. So there's a lot of aspects from the experience standpoint that would be different in the U.S. than the U.K. as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Rodney, one of the first things you said, and I'll paraphrase, was that the environment for food retail has changed. So I guess, I'm curious. Why was it surprising, given that, to see these hot promotional prices on milk and eggs? Shouldn't that have been sort of expected given that the environment has changed? Or maybe you were talking about something different, which is why I'm asking the question. And I guess for my follow-up, I'm curious what is in your guidance in terms of what you're assuming for competitive pricing as we look ahead? Because if things do get worse, and as Karen Short was pointing out, they likely will in terms of competition, I just want to understand what you guys are thinking and how much that's factored into your numbers at this point. 
W. McMullen: Okay. In terms of the environment is changing, I wouldn't tie it directly to milk and eggs. To me, that's just one example. But as you know, people change -- are changing the way they eat, and we could -- and we're committed and we will support the customer in changing the way they eat. So if you think about the comments on Prep + Pared, if you think about the comments on digital and using where a customer can engage with us digitally or in-store, what we find is a customer does both. So it's all of those things together when I talk about the way customers are eating is changing. And we intend to be there and take care of the customer the way they change. In terms of guidance, Mike, I'll let you... 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Again, in response to Karen's question, you never know when somebody in select markets is going to run some hot feature and you have to make independent decisions as those features hit the street, because if somebody just run an ad for a couple of weeks trying to get some business in the store or they're going to do something longer term. And when those kinds of ads stay there for a little bit longer, particularly when it's 2 important commodities like milk and eggs, ultimately, we're going to react and not allow our customers to think they have to go somewhere else to get the best value for those kinds of products. It just so happens those 2 commodities are big, big commodities and it's expensive when hot features hit versus some other commodities. And to say we do or don't have something exactly built onto our business plan, that's difficult to say. But we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores. 
W. McMullen: It's our best guess in terms of what we see happening going forward in terms of at this point in time. 
Kenneth Goldman: Can I just sneak one quick one in to make sure I understand? Is the message then that -- and Mike and Rodney, that is helpful. But is the message that you can't really predict it, so you're not necessarily factoring in, as a general rule, more competitive prices? Or is the message maybe that you are, but it's harder to be that specific about it? 
J. Schlotman: I think we all believe that the industry's going to continue to get more competitive, because every year, it does get more competitive. I think the price investments that we've made so far, from our original pricing plan, are taking good hold and good effect. And we always build dollars in and -- to try to allow us to react to competitive pressures. So I don't -- I think the guidance, where we've lowered it to, certainly has some of both in it. Does it [ encompass ] everything that may happen? As Rodney said, it's our best guess at this point in time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I guess, should the environment remain challenging from here, can you maybe just talk about your flexibility to further reduce CapEx and perhaps redeploy the buybacks or other avenues to increase shareholder value? 
W. McMullen: As you know, from a capital investment standpoint, we continue to adjust, and over the last year, we've reduced the amount that we invest in store, increasingly invest, increase the amount we're spending from a digital standpoint and an infrastructure standpoint. We will always want to keep our stores up-to-date and fresh in terms of the 4 walls themselves. What we find is what the customer wants and needs are it's constantly changing. So some of the things that I talked about, we'll need to make changes in the store to support that. If we -- we would believe that we can continue to reduce the amount of capital we're spending if we're not getting a return on that capital. We would still be looking like -- looking at it like a hawk. In terms of every dollar we spend, are we getting a return for that dollar that we're spending? And over time, does that create value? If for some reason it doesn't, we would reduce -- we have continued to increase the focus on the infrastructure, digital and some of the other parts and deemphasized stores in terms of net new stores. I don't know Mike, anything you want to... 
J. Schlotman: I absolutely agree with that. 
Erica Eiler: Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching gears to private label. You talked quite a bit about private label in your prepared remarks. It seems that a lot of groceries out there are increasingly pushing private label lately. Some cases, select players are even lowering prices on private label. So are you at all seeing step-up efforts from the leading CPG players to support their products, whether it's through more promotional dollars or through other avenues? It just seems that there would be much more of a sense of urgency at this point, given what seems to be this increased retailer focus on private label. 
W. McMullen: Well, as you know, our brands has been incredibly important to Kroger since the founding of the company. And the research that we did last year, we wanted to make sure that we weren't just biased because we're so close to it, and we did the research with our customers. And our customers gave us glowing feedback on how strong our brands were, how great the products were in a blind panel. So they didn't know it was us. If you look at our Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic, we just crushed the competitors in that space. So for us, our brand has always been massively important, and we will have a world-class our brand approach. And it's important for our customers. It's important in terms of being able to make money as well. So we don't look at it in terms of trying to do something versus a CPG. We really look at it as our brand and building our brand and doing the things the customer wants. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Tanal: In sort of thinking through the cut to the guide, I'm curious to know how you're planning food margins for the balance of the year relative to Q1. Do you think the year-on-year gross margin pressure's bottomed? Or are you planning for that to get worse? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say that when we look at gross margins overall, there's a variety of factors that wind up going into that. I think you'll continue to see us over time reduce gross margins. If you think about my prepared comments, over the last 12 or 14 years, we've taken $3.8 billion -- we've invested $3.8 billion in price by the drop we've made in gross margin. And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down. It's typically what happens in any segment of retailing, to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter. I probably wouldn't get that specific. But certainly, when you look at it over time, we built our business model assuming that gross margins will go down. We need stronger IDs than we've had the last few quarters. And we need to get back into the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin. Obviously, as I said in my prepared remarks, these aren't representative of the results we expect to deliver over time. But every once in a while, you run through cycles where you have to step back and adjust many of the metrics inside the company, and we feel that we've done a good job of reacting offensively and proactively to the environment around us, both from a labor standpoint, from a price investment standpoint and what makes sense to grow the business for the long term. 
Stephen Tanal: I guess 2 related sort of follow-up questions. The first would be the milk and eggs example. How widespread is that issue? And the second would be maybe qualitatively, as you think about the guidance and passing through the cost inflation that you're seeing, what's generally built in? Like how long are you sort of guiding so that you can hold the line on price longer than you think others will? Or is that a little different for any reason? 
J. Schlotman: Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, except in categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making. You typically won't see us anymore -- maybe in the '90s, we did this, but you won't see the kind of reaction where we have very, very hot features that, in the end, don't drive any kind of loyalty in your store and just tries to drive foot traffic and get them to buy other things. Will we react to those types of things and make investments so that they don't attract any of our customers to their stores? Absolutely, we will. But I think if you look over time, we'll continue to be proactive on how we make the investments. 
Stephen Tanal: Okay, fair enough. And just lastly on meal kits. I know it was about 4 stores some weeks ago. How fast is that being rolled out? How fast can it be rolled out? And if you'd give us a feel for how incremental the sales are, maybe how you're pricing it versus kind of the group of ingredients in those kits, that would be helpful as well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. A great question that I won't get into all the specifics, because obviously, competitors would appreciate that knowledge as well. What we're finding is the quality of that meal is the same as going to a restaurant and getting a meal, but people like to prepare something at home, and they find it easy and they love the variety that we offer. So a lot of the price comparisons is what the price is versus going to a restaurant, but being able to do it at home. And when it takes you 20 minutes, it's just as fast as picking it up at Kroger's than it's going to a restaurant and going through all that hassle when you're at a restaurant. And we're getting great feedback. We'll continue to roll it out based on the ability for the facilities to handle the volume. And so far, it's been very good, and we appreciate, and looking forward to where it goes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: I just wanted to kind of like broaden it out a little bit and try to understand kind of where you guys think your business is. And I heard Mike talking about gross margin pressure. As we look at the market, it seems like it's almost like the headline would be more Amazon moving into consumables, more Walmart price investments, more Walmart click-and-collect, more Aldi, more Lidl. And so with this natural pressure on gross margins, there's also seemingly a natural pressure on cost. And so as you look forward, I know you guys kind of reiterated your 11 -- 8% to 11% EPS growth rate. I'm just trying to understand over a number of years, how that's going to be possible in this environment? And do you need to make more aggressive, more offensive moves here with the business given this environment? 
W. McMullen: It's really making sure that we're using the advantages we have. Obviously, the data that we have, our average customer only has to drive a mile to get to one of our stores. So it's using that personalization to connect with the customer directly on a one-on-one basis and having where they can engage with us any way they want to. So if they want to pick up their groceries, if they want it delivered or if they want to shop and go the old-fashioned way, for lack of a better word, we continue to add services. And all of those services is part of the model in terms of making it an easy place to stop. So if you think about fuel and some of the others. So it's really the sum of all those pieces together that we're offering, and we're doing it in a seamless way. So it's -- I don't disagree with the more, more, more, but there's also things that are a huge advantage for us. And when you look at all those things, when a customer comes into our stores, we still give them a great experience on a friendly face, we have incredibly fresh product, and it's important for us to continue to improve on those aspects because that's what will be a point of difference. 
Scott Mushkin: So then my follow-up question would be regarding scale. Does Kroger have enough scale, in your minds, to compete in this environment against the likes of Walmart and Amazon, which are just -- produce tremendous amounts of cash, both companies. So I was wondering, as you look at the business, obviously, you're a large company, but a lot of investments need to be made. Do you need more scale? 
W. McMullen: Yes. From everything, from our perspective, we would have plenty of scale. And certainly $115 billion revenue company, we would have the scale. The other thing is if you look at like our own brands, the strength of our own brands and the strength of the experience the customers enjoy. All those things, obviously, add to that scale as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: So I just want to clarify. You did say tonnage was positive, but if you just take out the inflation or the deflation rate, it looks like it might've slowed sequentially. 
J. Schlotman: I didn't catch the first part of your question. The what was... 
W. McMullen: Tonnage. 
Andrew Wolf: Your tonnage. I just want to know if the tonnage has slowed. And if so -- tonnage growth. You said tonnage growth is positive. But just given the numbers you provide us, it looks as if it slowed sequentially. Just want to confirm that? And then ask you... 
J. Schlotman: I'm not going to get into -- we typically don't give exact tonnage numbers. And if you look at ID sales compared to inflation, deflation, you get really skewed results when you try to add those 2 numbers together because of the mix of product that wind up being inside of those categories. When you have inflation in certain categories and deflation in other categories, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison. Just stepping back from exact tonnage and things like that, when you have the number of loyal households we have and you add 3.2% growth on the loyal households and your ID sales with your loyal households is on a positive trend, those are all great signs of health for our business over time. Without giving the -- we're very happy with our unit growth in the first quarter, let's just stay with that. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay, great. Last quarter, you said whatever -- the market share growth, at least as you've given it out annually, was a little less than '16 than it had been in prior years. What I'm really trying to get to is in the last quarter, you said it was more store-based -- your traditional store base competitors running better stores. And meanwhile, you're talking more about a changing environment. So I just want to check in with you. Is that still what mainly you see as creating a heightened competitive environment here? Or is it starting to be, as Scott was alluding to, what's going on digitally, whether it's Amazon or other offers? 
W. McMullen: Estimating market share, as you know, is always difficult. But the -- our growth in the first quarter, certainly on the analysis, would indicate that our market share growth in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter. And as Mike said, we're pleased with what our unit growth was, we're pleased with our improvement in trend and we're pleased with the improvement in market share trends as well. 
J. Schlotman: And the loyal household growth. 
Andrew Wolf: Great. Well, that's encouraging. Do you want to comment on whether -- where you're seeing competitive -- it's obvious, new entrants coming into market, but some of them are store-based folks like Lidl and Aldi, and some are online like Amazon. So just in terms of what you're reacting to and so forth, or how you see things in the future, where do you -- what is your perspective? Is it still going to be a store-based competitive landscape? Or do you see being digital, including perhaps home delivery with certain click and collect, more of Kroger's future, really what you're stepping up to. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, we really see the customer -- all our strategies and things are where do we anticipate the customer going. Everything that we could see and see, and doing what we're building our infrastructure for is to be able to serve the customer the way they want to be served. And everything that we can see, we find that the customer likes the combination of everything versus just one approach. And we continue to partner with third-party on doing deliveries. We have that in a couple of markets and we continue to expand that. We continue to expand the number of items that are offered. And obviously, we continue to expand the number of ClickList ExpressLane stores we have. But everything that we can see, the customer wants to shop on their terms the way they want to, but they still, for certain items, like to come into a physical store because they like to interact with people. And we think it's incredibly important to continue to have a strong physical presence, but it's the sum of all parts rather than just each one individually. 
Andrew Wolf: I just want to follow up, if I could, on the regional price, the hot pricing in dairy. Could you tell us what regions? Is that more in the East where -- is it proactive to Lidl's entry more so than not? And just generally, how widespread that is. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I won't to comment on exactly where we sell those, other than it was not concentrated only there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to just go back to the pricing philosophy. Obviously, it'd been talked about a lot, but I think warranted given the fact that for investors today, probably the line that jumped out most within the release was, we will not lose on price. So you talked about obviously being certainly a part of that is proactive. I'm sure some of it in given markets is reactive. But can you just give us a little bit better sense on kind of the true kind of philosophy around balancing that kind of strict price versus, obviously, a lot of the other factors that Kroger has going for it and kind of who that may be kind of most aimed after, that'd be great. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I think it's important for people not to overplay the price comment. As you know, we do a ton of work on understanding where the customer wants and needs are, and we're incredibly focused on differentiating our experience versus our competitors in terms of the service our associates provide, the products and the quality of the products; the quality, especially in the fresh areas, in produce and meat and seafood and our deli; and the shopping experience itself. So how long did it take me to get into the store? How long did it take me to get through the checkout line? What type of experience? Those are the things that we're focused on and that we will differentiate ourselves. We're increasingly differentiating ourselves in terms of the ability to do -- engage with us any way you want. Price, we're just making sure we don't lose customers because of price. So it's really those pieces together is where we're focused on and focused on delivering for the customer. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up to that, maybe more on the promotional environment, and obviously a big, kind of more theoretical question for everyone on the call is how much of this is more kind of permanent shifts in pricing versus more of just kind of the weekly blockbuster promotions, kind of like what you mentioned? So I guess, how do you think about, particularly in the second half of this year with the commodity costs showing signs of improvement, how much of kind of -- maybe some of those weekly promotions do you expect on your side to kind of moderate versus how much of this may just be more kind of permanent in nature? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at how people are going to promote and what weekly features are going to be, I wouldn't have enough time to step back and think about how our merchants develop their marketing plan. They're well out -- they're multiple weeks out. We certainly make assumptions about how customers or how other competitors react around holidays, how they may react in weeks during the summer when there's a lot of vacations going on and maybe fewer people at home shopping and what kind of promotions they may do. But to be able to sit here and say, this is exactly what we're expecting from a promotional standpoint, would be very difficult to say I have X, Y or Z built into the plan, other than we know there's always going to be markets and there always are markets where there are a lot of hot features going on. There's other markets that are kind of in the middle. There's high, low kind of activity kind of normal traditional grocery store pricing. And then there's other markets that are relatively benign, where you go about your daily life. Now fortunately for us, we have the number of markets we're in and the breadth of those markets, that not every market is hyper competitive at the same time. And some of the ones that aren't quite as competitive help offset that. So to sit here and try to project what the competitive environment, or more specifically, the promotional environment may be, would probably not be significantly prudent. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just some more questions on margins and the price investments. I guess it seems fair to ask where these hot ads are? Are these traditional supermarkets? Are there any different kind of behavior that you would expect to get better over the next coming quarters from these competitors with these hot ads? And I guess, as you respond to them, how much of your response in terms of price investments is going in personalized efforts, personalized discounts versus your everyday pricing? And are you seeing any different changes in terms of what you would expect in terms of elasticity to those price investments that you are making? 
J. Schlotman: I'm not sure exactly where to start on all those questions. At the end of the day, we always assume this industry is going to get more competitive, quarter in, quarter out; year in, year out. And unfortunately, I guess, we're rarely disappointed with the result of our expectation, and that's that it's always a competitive market, it's always been a competitive industry. In our view, it's going to continue to be competitive. There are bursts of time where things heat up, and then there are bursts of times where it cool down. And we know over time that if somebody runs a hot feature over the course of a weekend, that's one thing. If somebody appears to be trying to put a stake in the ground on big volume important commodities to drive volume into their stores, the best thing we can do to counteract that is, as Rodney say, not lose on price on that commodity because that takes the advantage away from them and it doesn't cause any -- it doesn't get any of our loyal customers or any of our customers any reason to go anywhere else to shop. And you have to make judgments throughout the course of 1.25 years of is this a short-term thing somebody is doing that you can -- not necessarily this way, but by and large, ignore? Or is this something you need to react to? How do you balance that with planned price promotions you have? How do -- nobody on the call can see the advantage we create with our loyal households, with the My Magazines Rodney talked about where there were 6 million individualized offers in the first quarter alone that offered those households a different price than anybody sees on our shelf edge. We do that without creating any kind of price impression amongst our competitors because they don't know we're doing it. But that's the way to be able to reward and give a better price to our most loyal customers without putting it on the front page of an ad and perhaps us causing something like that happen. So we're constantly using those kind of advantages we have, primarily through 84.51°, to figure out how to reward our most loyal customers the best. 
W. McMullen: And the only other thing I would add, Kelly, to Mike's point, is if you look, typically, you'll have consolidation, and consolidation happens in spurts. And everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out, and it's one of the things that we think is incredibly important, to have the scale that we have and the diversity across the whole country that we have, because it allows us to continue to do what's right for our customers. We'll continue to work on improving the basic operation. And by doing those things, the shareholders continue to get a great return over time as well. 
Kelly Bania: Great. I guess my follow-up to that would be just in this environment, are you thinking about M&A any differently given what you just said? 
J. Schlotman: I wouldn't say we're thinking about M&A any differently at all. I do agree with Rodney's assessment of consolidation, and I think you'll continue to see us have the opportunity to increase our footprint in markets we're already in by the consolidation of competitors who are going by the wayside. You saw the news reports from earlier in the week in Vienna. And I think there'll be further opportunities like that going throughout the course of the next few years. It's one of the reasons why Rodney's comment on reducing our capital expenditure, on increasing our footprint. It doesn't worry me too much over the next few years because I think I can lower my CapEx, invest it in things that are going to drive sales and reduce operating costs and increase my footprint at prices below what it would cost me to build from the ground up. And when they get into those kinds of situations, it says you really want [ to fit great ] rather than buying an entire chain and trying to do something with that. So I feel really good about that part of what's going on around us. 
Operator: And our final question today will come from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Rodney, could you talk a little bit about how prepared foods did just as a category, all the forms in which you sell in market prepared foods did versus a year ago? 
W. McMullen: It continued to grow nicely versus a year ago. It would be one of the strongest departments. And it's one of those things, as you know, we think it's -- more and more customers will go in that direction. And as you know, we went to the outside to hire some talent there, and we really feel good about the opportunity in terms of the growth opportunities, and we love the progress we're making. 
Charles Cerankosky: Is that an area that is going to get more capital dollars when Mike spoke earlier of infrastructure spending? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it'll get more capital dollars. But more importantly, it'll get more attention and just the discretionary efforts of organization, we will -- it's not as capital-intensive to make the changes we need to make there. The key thing is changing -- keeping the menus fresh and up-to-date and the attention that we spend in that area. 
Charles Cerankosky: And then switching to some of the offsets. Mike hinted about operating cost, projects to reduce operating expenses. That might be overshadowed this year by some of the wage investments. But could you highlight some of the projects that are going on, please? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't get too specific. One of the bigger areas that is always -- particularly of late, we have a lot of projects going on in and around shrink, some tests going on in a handful of markets trying to reduce the trends on shrink. It's early on those handful of markets, but early signs are the tests we're doing seem to be encouraging. And hopefully, as we get to the end of the year, it starts to be end of the year and into next year, something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of a headwind. 
Charles Cerankosky: By headwind, you mean the wage investments this year are going to cover up a lot of the other expense reduction efforts? 
J. Schlotman: Or just shrink not being exactly where we want it and these projects being able to turn the trend on shrink. 
W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I just want make a couple of comments. First of all, the changes that we talked about today and the direction we're headed in, we're making those changes proactively, and it's really based on where we see the customer is going. And we think it's incredibly important to do those changes in advance. And we're massively excited about the growth opportunities for the business going forward. We feel really good about our team in terms of the opportunities and taking advantage of those. So I wanted to make that. 
 And then I also, as you know, I always like to share some comments with our associates who are listening in. As you've heard us describe during this call, we're focused on executing our Customer 1st Strategy and living our company's purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Feed the Human Spirit is our purpose because both our customers and you, our associates, told us it resonates powerfully with you. And also because it's authentic to Kroger, it's who we are. We've been living our purpose in large ways and small for more than 134 years, whether it's through providing over 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our neighborhoods over the last 4 years, committing to be a Zero Waste company by 2020, or simply extending a smile or a helping hand to the customer, we and you make the world a better place one associate, one customer, one community at a time. Thank you for all you do every day for our customers and each other. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2017-03-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thank you, Carrie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 As we all know, some times are just more challenging than others, and last year certainly didn't end the way we expected at the start of the year. But 2016 still had its bright spots. Of course, our associates and our customers are always a bright spot, and I'm so proud of this team for their continuing focus on taking care of our customers each and every time they interact in our stores. Despite the challenging operating environment, our team pulled together to deliver some results that we should take stock of.
 Over the past year, the Kroger team delivered our 12th consecutive year of market share growth; overall tonnage growth; record-high unit share in our Corporate Brands portfolio, which was led by another blockbuster $1.7 billion year for Simple Truth; a strategic merger with specialty pharmacy leader, ModernHEALTH; and reached an agreement to merge with the world's greatest purveyor of specialty cheese, Murray's Cheese; and we created more than 12,000 new American jobs in our stores and hired more than 9,000 veterans and military family members. That's a lot to be proud of.
 We're obviously disappointed with our identical supermarket sales number in the fourth quarter and our performance on several other KPIs, including FIFO operating margin and return on invested capital, which were driven by the deflationary environment. Kroger is always focused on executing against our long-term strategy. We are lowering costs to invest those savings in our people, our business and the technologies to position Kroger to deliver the value proposition customers are seeking today and in the future.
 One example of our efforts to control administrative costs is making the very difficult decision to extend the voluntary retirement offer for certain nonstore associates that we announced in December. Approximately 2,000 nonstore associates were eligible for the offer, and at this point, we estimate approximately 1,300 will accept it.
 As our customers change and evolve, we are taking steps to meet them where they are and more importantly, where they are going. We're making meaningful investments in digital. We feel great about these investments because customers tell us they are important to them.
 We have aggressively added more than 420 ClickList and ExpressLane locations in 2016, bringing our total online ordering locations to more than 640. This effort was based on learnings from our merger with Harris Teeter. We are also experimenting with ways to solve the last mile equation. We're testing with Uber delivery in several locations with plans to expand in 2017 where our customers can order through ClickList and choose to have their groceries delivered by a local Uber driver. We have a couple of other home delivery tests as well.
 We're building our digital experiences today, so that customers can engage and shop for anything, anytime, anywhere with us in the future. The excellent service they get from our associates in the stores will carry over seamlessly to the digital platforms whether shopping online, finding great promotions and recipes that are personalized and relevant to them or downloading more than -- one of the more than 1 billion digital offers loaded to shopper carts each year.
 More and more customers are connecting digitally with Kroger. We are leveraging refined customer insights from 84.51° as well as years of online shopping experience from both Vitacost.com and Harris Teeter to develop a sophisticated understanding of our customers' behavior when shopping with us online, in-store and both. We're utilizing this rich data sort set to make decisions about where the right locations to offer ClickList, what are the right assortments and promotions to engage customers online and how can we offer the quality and convenience online that customers have come to expect from a Kroger brick-and-mortar location.
 We are also keenly aware of growing customer trends like health and wellness and high-quality fresh and prepared foods. Our initiatives in these areas are designed to deliver convenience to our time-starved customers and will continue to be a big focus of both our capital and Customer 1st investments.
 Now we could stop all of these investments given the headwinds our industry is facing. That might make our results look better today, but we are playing for the long term, and that requires being deliberate and determined. There are a lot of companies out there right now investing in digital and e-commerce in opportunistic ways that will likely never create value for their shareholders. A core strength of Kroger is our ability both create shareholder value today and to make meaningfully strategic investments for the future. We remain determined to execute on our strategy, and we are deliberately investing to grow and create long-term value for our shareholders.
 Our Corporate Brands business was another real bright spot in 2016. Our brands are in more homes than ever before. In fact, our customers fill their carts with more than 1.25 million Corporate Brand items every hour. We are incredibly proud of the quality of our Corporate Brand products. Our quality is only getting better, and that showed clearly in the Corporate Brands' performance last year when we sold a record number of units and in the fourth quarter, when Corporate Brands had an all-time-high unit share of 29.2%.
 Simple Truth grew at an impressive rate again in 2016, reaching total sales of $1.7 billion. Simple Truth Organic accounted for more than $1 billion of that figure last year, and we still see more growth ahead in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines. In fact, we've begun offering Simple Truth to even more customers throughout the United States by making it available on Vitacost.com. Today, you can find online and conveniently ship to home many of our Simple Truth's food, snacks and supplements as well as household and personal care products. Interestingly, New York City is already the #2 Simple Truth online sales market for us, even though we don't have store physical presence there.
 As you know, we always build our business plan assuming the environment is going to get more competitive the next year and not less. We also don't run a business model that relies on inflation returning. Rather, we proactively make the changes we need to, to remain competitive well into the future.
 Kroger's core strengths remain our most valuable assets. On the people front, we have great associates, an effective and experienced management team and a deep bench of future leaders; on the financial front, a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to create sustainable shareholder value; and on the consumer front, deep customer insights through our data analytic experts at 84.51° and above all, an unwavering commitment to putting our customers first.
 What also remains unchanged is our commitment to long-term growth that investors can count on. Over the last 5 years, Kroger's annual net earnings per diluted share growth rate was 16.3%, excluding onetime items. Over the last 3 years, it was 14.2%, excluding onetime items. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend.
 And now Mike will go into more detail on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's market share grew for the 12th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive both top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it: where they spend their money.
 According to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points in 2016 with 14 of 22 markets up, 2 flat and 6 markets down. Starting in 2017, we plan to begin using IRI point-of-sales data to measure market share. While we expect there to be some differences in share reporting between Nielsen and IRI, we expect those differences to be minimal. Regardless of the source, we use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It is also worth noting that market share data is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales.
 Looking at ID sales, deflation was the primary driver of our negative results for the quarter. Inflation-adjusted ID sales were positive in the fourth quarter.
 Deflation, excluding fuel, persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw a decline in pharmacy inflation, an acceleration in produce deflation and a slowing in grocery deflation.
 Another headwind to ID sales was our capital program. Over the last 4 quarters, we relocated or expanded 35 strong performing stores, taking them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. This caused about a 70 basis point headwind to ID sales in the fourth quarter.
 Tonnage was positive during the fourth quarter, and we continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products, which, by the way, hit nearly $16 billion in sales in 2016 in areas where we are saving customers' time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions.
 We always give a little insight into our ID sales data. Visits per household, and price per unit were down in the fourth quarter, but those were slightly offset by basket size and household growth. Loyal households continue to grow at a faster rate than total households, which was true for both the quarter and the year. It is interesting to note that loyal households has slightly positive ID growth in the fourth quarter.
 Operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales, excluding fuel, recent mergers and a $30 million contributions in the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2015, declined by 11 basis points. Rent and depreciation, with the same exclusions, increased by 24 basis points. While this result was better than the third quarter, we can, and we'll do better. We are working diligently to pull costs out of the business and improve processes to lower costs through the rate of sales and deliver value to customers.
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.18 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. For 2016 in total, we were at $0.171 for the year and $0.174 in 2015.
 Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.31x compared to 2.08x during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and increases in working capital. The increase in working capital is driven by higher inventory in 4 locations where we opened new or expanded distribution centers. When doing this, we duplicate inventory for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. Also, accrued liabilities are lower due to lower incentive plan payout accruals. This portion will reverse itself in the first quarter when incentive plan cash payments will be lower.
 It is worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we continue to work with our unions to modify pension plans. We continue to negotiate restructuring of troubled multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits as we did in the second quarter. These restructurings do not change the total obligations of the company because the debt we had is offset by a reduction in the amount of our off-balance sheet multi-employer pension plan obligations.
 In 2016, Kroger used cash to repurchase $1.8 billion in common shares, paid $429 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $3.6 billion for the year compared to $3.5 billion last year. The flexibility to the return to -- the return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy.
 Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09%. This result was affected by current year results and recently merged companies. We are committed to growing return on invested capital over the long term.
 I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center and with the UFCW partner, North Carolina clerks and meat associates. We are currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta and Michigan. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.
 Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and doing it profitably, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We anticipate identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth for 2017. We expect net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 benefit for the 53rd week. We anticipate the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar to the second half of 2016. Our results in the second half of '17 should show improvement as we cycle the previous year.
 We recognize that this is an unusual year, and that's why we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year, rather than compare it to our long-term guidance rate as we've done in the past. In fact, for the first quarter, we're going to give you an earnings per share range, which is not something we plan to do over the long term, but we think it's important to be very clear about how we think the year is going to progress.
 For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be slightly up compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be up high single digits compared to last year without the benefit of the 53rd week. Our guidance for the year excludes the estimated cost of the voluntary retirement offer but does include the anticipated expense savings, which we will reinvest in the business. Over the long term, we are committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend.
 We expect a LIFO charge of $25 million for the year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales-generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives. As we invest more in these areas, our investment in stores will be reduced. And we anticipate Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results.
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We've never been more determined about our future. We continue to focus on gaining the larger share in the $1.5 trillion U.S. food market. We are working on process changes to lower costs and use those savings to invest in our people, our business and technologies that will enhance Kroger's competitiveness in the future. We will continue to deliver for our customers today while setting the company up for our next phase of growth in Customer 1st innovation. We know that when we deliver for our customers, we create long-term value for our shareholders.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities, LLC. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, let me start with ClickList. Generally speaking, what's the rollout plan for '17? Or do you want to study the 420 a bit more? And then, what have you learned from the 420 you did last year in terms of driving new customer acquisition and building share of wallet with loyal households? Anything you can share on that? 
W. McMullen: Okay. If you look at the '17 plan, at this point, we would expect probably to open a few less in '17 than '16, but it's not driven by the enthusiasm for ClickList. It's driven by finding stores with the space in it and incorporating it, and getting zoning changes and anything else that we need to do. One of the things -- probably, the biggest learning that's at least been a surprise to me, probably not for others, is customers continue to shop inside the store even when they become a ClickList customer. And they'll buy certain products via ClickList, but they still come into the store. If you look at the more mature locations, you can start seeing more financially, they start getting to the point where we're really indifferent in terms of whether somebody shops in store or online. Obviously, that's just the early ones that have been opened more at Harris Teeter than at Kroger. So we continue to have that headwind, and we'll continue to have that headwind in '17 just because the sheer number that we're opening and the number that we opened late in 2016. But they continue to mature, and we can clearly see at a point where we're actually indifferent on how the customer shops with us. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then just shifting gears, 2 maybe not related but financial questions. FIFO gross margin x fuel, a little more pressure in the fourth quarter than prior quarters. Where did that come from? And then, the first quarter, when you look at the cadence in the first quarter earnings number, obviously, a substantial deviation from the rest of the year. So curious, is that driven by -- you would think it's driven by something aberrational. I don't know if that's pension or shrink, or what drives that? 
W. McMullen: I'll let Mark -- Mike talk about the quarter stuff. But on the -- if you look at the gross, it's really a combination of several things. Some would be driven by pharmacy continues to be a headwind on gross. Other areas there, we have definitely become more promotional and more aggressive on some pricing as our sales were softer. So it's really both of those elements together.
 Mike, I'll let you answer the quarter comment. 
J. Schlotman: Sure, John. As I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect the first half of the year to be much like how 2016 ended, and it's really just carrying the current trends out through the first -- as you know, this is a 16-week quarter for us, through those first 16 weeks of the year, and we see the clarity to some of the programs Rodney mentioned. And the fact that we continue to drive unit growth, we do expect to see the recovery in the sales later in the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
Stephen Tanal: I guess I'd just ask, what you guys are seeing in the competitive environment, to start? Clearly, there's at least some chains that are putting up slightly better comps or better comps, and obviously, versus Nielsen, it looks like you're gaining share. But I wonder what you're seeing, and if you feel like there's a certain customer you may be losing or if there is something you could comment on markets where you're competing with more online challengers. Just any color there in terms of where you think some of the traffic may be headed. 
W. McMullen: If you look at it from a competitive environment, most of the changes that we would see is competitors running better stores. I don't think there's any doubt that they are. Most -- you and among others have written about it. Certainly, it wouldn't -- there isn't anything that would show that it's going to online at all. So it would be more driven by some of the competitors running better stores versus other aspects.
 I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No. 
Stephen Tanal: I guess, is that -- can you give a sense for whether it's a lower-end customer or a higher-income consumer or right in the middle, or any color you can provide there? 
W. McMullen: If you -- one of the comments that Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks was when you look at our loyal shopper, we actually had positive identicals with our loyal shoppers. So it's really the customer that isn't very loyal to us. It's where we're seeing it. That would be more driven by value shoppers or shoppers on a budget than mainstream and customers that really value the experience and the freshness of our product and other aspects. 
Stephen Tanal: I see. And I guess, it's safe to say you're probably not seeing all too different in sort of a bigger, denser, more affluent cities that you're in where there are more home delivery options. And I just got one more follow-up on -- one more after that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. We're really not seeing it from that aspect at all. And the other thing I think is important to note, we aggressively increased the amount of capital we were spending and increased the number of stores that we were relocating and remodeling, and Mike mentioned it. But if you look at about 35 stores we relocated or expanded, which took them out of the identical calculation, which actually hurt our total company identicals by 70 basis points. So I think that's the other thing that's important to remember. 
Stephen Tanal: That's helpful. Then I just -- the last one for me, maybe for Mike is, the impact of the early retirement offer on OG&A, if you could sort of quantify that, and perhaps maybe is that ramping through the year? Is that maybe why the year looks a little more back-half-weighted than we would have guessed? Or I think... 
J. Schlotman: Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, the -- as we finalize what the expense of that will be, that will be reflected in the first quarter. The offer is not entirely closed. So we won't know until next week exactly how many people ultimately accepted the offer. And there will be varying times when people ultimately retire, so that does go throughout the year as we -- as those folks ultimately retire. Do keep in mind, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates. We do have the savings in our plan and they're a portion of what we plan to invest to increase the value proposition for our customers. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. 
Chris  Mandeville: So just maybe sticking with the guidance here. Is it fair to assume that gross margins will be down in a similar fashion for the first half of this year just kind of given Q4 results and commentary for the full year being down 10 basis points? And then, I guess, for the back half of the year, that would imply, I would assume, some gross margin expansion, to some degree. I get maybe Q4, but can you help us understand why Q3 should be implying 20%-plus EPS growth? And lastly, how does deflation or inflation for that matter play into 1H versus 2H? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I mean, there's a variety of contributing factors. Obviously, going back to the first quarter, we're cycling one of, if not, the strongest quarter from the prior year. We had high teens earnings per share growth. We had 2.4% IDs in the first quarter of last year, so we're up against our toughest compare for one thing. Also, as we go through the year, I'm not going to -- I won't break down gross profit by quarter. We try to stick with ID sales and operating profit. We do plan to continue to make the investments, as I said, in the value proposition for our customers, which we think will continue to drive IDs back into the positive range. 
Operator: The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Karen Short: Just on the guidance, just to clarify 1 or 2 things. So guidance does include buybacks, correct? 
J. Schlotman: It does. 
Karen Short: Okay. And I would assume that maybe given that you have more free cash flow this year than last that the priorities will be skewed to buybacks? 
J. Schlotman: We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback we'll do. It'll obviously be dependent on market conditions as well as our board being willing to give us incremental authorization. We will run out of our existing authorization here in the very near term. We've been buying shares since late last year and all through so far this year, off of a grid established in the 10b5-1 plan. So it'll be somewhat predicated on our board giving us incremental authority. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. Sorry, were you going to say something? 
W. McMullen: Yes. And the other thing that Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, if you look at the range of estimated capital investment in '17 is lower than '16 as well. 
Karen Short: Right. So okay, with that then in mind, I guess, when I look at your guidance and I try to kind of back in the operating profit growth, it does look like you can get there but with some pretty meaningful offsets to SG&A in terms of SG&A per week. And SG&A per week has been growing pretty meaningfully, and I know you pointed to that as an area of opportunity, and you talked about that a lot on this call. But I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile like how much you actually have to get that down to achieve your guidance but also reconciling that with that you want to invest for the long term. So wondering if you could talk to that a little bit. 
J. Schlotman: Well, there -- I can tell you, there are a lot of efforts we have under way to reduce our total cost of doing business, and it's in a variety of areas. We can do better on shrink. We can do better on store growth productivity in some areas. We can certainly do better on in-stock in some areas. And one of the great things about being in a company the size and breadth of Kroger is there's not an initiative we have out there that we don't already have a very large group of stores achieving. We don't have to go outside the company and point to competitor X is doing this, so we are. Every metric we have out there for our stores to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results. And as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, that's one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the 4 keys. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: I have 2 questions related to deflation. First, I wanted to get a sense of what you guys are assuming for deflation or inflation this year and whether you expect to return to positive growth or positive prices later this year. And then secondly, related to that, we're hearing more and more announcements, whether it's Target, Walmart and others, just talking more about price investments. Do you expect, I guess, the deflationary impact of competitor actions to be potentially more this year than what you've seen in recent years? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I think you're doing what a lot of people do, including this morning when I was on CNBC of mixing inflation and deflation at cost and retail. When we talk about our inflation or deflation, it's our product cost inflation or deflation. You kind of threw in what's going to happen to retail product cost inflation or deflation. Overall, we do think that we'll return to a slightly inflationary environment in the back half of the year. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that we pretty much had, I think Rodney was talking even before we went on the call, it's 9 quarters in a row of deflation. 
W. McMullen: Of declining. 
J. Schlotman: Of declining. 
W. McMullen: Inflation/deflation. 
J. Schlotman: Either inflation coming down or actual deflation, it's 9 straight quarters now that, that trend line would be down. So it's been obviously fairly persistent. Despite that, even though we had a lot lower pharmacy inflation in the quarter, that still generated a very large LIFO charge. It was offset by other areas that had deflation. So it's a completely mixed bag. Even in the fourth quarter, grocery inflation over the course of the quarter was basically half of what it was in the third quarter. But produce inflation went up 600 basis points or deflation expanded by 600 basis points. It was over 7% deflationary in the quarter. So it's a huge mixed bag of what's out there, and I'm not going to pinpoint an exact number because I've proven over the years that I can predict a totally inaccurate number on inflation or even LIFO. But we continue to manage through the process that we have. 
W. McMullen: As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do expect the market to get more competitive. We've assumed that for a long period of time. We continue to see great opportunities for process change in taking costs out of the business. And the last couple of calls, I've mentioned that we're definitely down on those. In the fourth quarter, we made more progress on those than we did in the third quarter, and you can begin to see some of those things paying some fruit. As Mike mentioned, we're starting to cycle actual deflation. We think the first part of the year will still look an awful lot like third and fourth quarter. But once you get to third quarter, you start cycling some of those strong deflationary numbers and wouldn't see it. The other thing that I think is important to note, if you look at cost of goods, there's all kinds of things that we are doing to finance and pay for some of that through cost of goods savings and other pieces of the business as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Just wanted to see, with the promotional environment, any further color on kind of promotions by categories? Is it fair to say that the kind of the most deflationary is also getting the most promotions? And then also in -- just in relation to that, if you could give any further color around kind of the comp cadence expected, in addition to the very helpful EPS guidance by quarter. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On the promotions by category, we would use our 84.51° insights for that, and it would really be different by customer. Some of it would be things that you would do personalized one-on-one. So it actually -- and if you go into the store from checking the retail price, you wouldn't see it because its offers that are made directly to customers, some via coupons. It's all of the above because different customers react different ways to different promotions. So it's becoming an increasingly personalized offers based on what that particular customer wants and desires are, and it would be a mix of national brand, Corporate Brands and fresh product and others, so it's really a mix.
 On the comp by quarter, Mike, I'll let you... 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you'd repeat your question, I want to make sure I'm answering the question you asked and not what I have in my head. 
Vincent Sinisi: Yes. Sure, Mike. Just wondering if you could kind of give us, in relation to your full year ID sales guidance, how you're thinking about that on a quarterly basis. Maybe -- if any color around kind of where things are now and/or just how you're kind of thinking about that as we go forward each quarter. 
J. Schlotman: Well, the comment about we expect the first quarter to look a lot like the first quarter, I guess, would be a little bit of code for ID sales continue to be a little bit negative right now, which means we expect ID sales to recover as we go throughout the year. And that's going back to the questions that we've gotten on the cadence of how we expect to see the underlying EPS as that is predicated on an improvement in ID sales throughout the year. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. Perfect. And if I could just get a quick follow up in there. Just any updates worth highlighting with your partnership with Lucky's? 
J. Schlotman: Sure. Bo and his team out there in Colorado continue to do some exciting things inside their stores. Some of the new stores, they've opened. We're pretty excited about the sales levels that they've been able to generate. Bo continues to look at his book of business in his stores, and they're a very new company. He's learning as he goes, and he continue to make tweaks to his model and stopped doing some things that aren't working and try some new things that seem to have -- to be bearing fruit. But we're very pleased with what we see out of Bo and his team and continue to be enthusiastic about that kind of a format. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: The 70 basis point headwind from removing some of these high-performing stores from the ID sales base, I'm just trying to figure out. I don't think you've divulged that number in the past very often. Maybe you have, and I missed it. But how does that compare to what you saw in recent years? I'm just trying to figure it out. Is it unusually high impact, because you didn't do necessarily more relocations than you normally did? So was it just that the stores were so much better and taking them out of the base just hadn't that much more of an impact? Or maybe 70 basis points is similar to what you normally experienced. Just trying to get a sense there. 
J. Schlotman: It's not something we've talked about a whole lot, and it's one of those things when you -- if you have 3% or 4% IDs and you have a strong capital program and it's 30 or 40 or 50 basis points of headwinds from sister store impacts, the effect of that isn't as dramatic as it is when you're close to a 0 ID sales negative. So we haven't really talked about it. We did in the third quarter -- what did I say? 20 to 30 basis points. 
W. McMullen: Is what it typically is. 
J. Schlotman: Is what it typically is. So it is a bit higher today because we have been doing more stores. A couple of 3 years ago, we were under $3 billion in capital, and we were above $3.5 billion in capital this year. So we have ramped up our capital spend. We are touching more stores. We're opening more new stores, which caused a sister store impact and expanding and relocating some very strong stores, which continue to perform very well but haven't been brand reopened long enough to be into our identical store base yet. 
Kenneth Goldman: So that's helpful. Just to clarify, so it sounds like incrementally, I think -- it is rough, I know, but you're talking 40, 50 basis points of a headwind versus what you normally experience from this effect, and... 
J. Schlotman: And when you look at the number of stores we did over the last year compared to 2 or 3 years ago, it's about double, major store projects. 
Kenneth Goldman: So then, looking ahead, is it safe to assume we will still see roughly a 70 basis point impact over the next 3 quarters or so? And then how do we think about that in years beyond? Is that -- is this an unusual effect? Or do you continue to think that you're maybe just again, generally going to be relocating, expanding some of your higher-performing stores in the future? 
J. Schlotman: Well, as those stores are open long enough, they will flip back into our ID store base, and we would hope they continue to perform the way they are and be a tailwind to ID sales. And as I said in the prepared comments, we are taking capital down from what we would originally plan to spend in 2017 because we've been guiding folks to think about 2017 and even '18 to be a similar spend level that we did in '16. And most of that will come out of new store and will continue a strong remodel program. So when we remodel a store, it does not come out of IDs. It's only an expansion or a relocation or a net new that winds up affecting it. 
Kenneth Goldman: Right. I meant relocation. So just to clarify, Mike, though, is it not -- is it reasonable to assume that sort of 70-ish basis point headwind will continue for the next 4 -- few, 3 quarters or so? 
J. Schlotman: I think it'll continue for a while, but it'll decline over time as those stores become identical again. 
Operator: The next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: Yes. I just want to get a better understanding of the cadence of your tonnage growth and your nonfuel IDs during the fourth quarter. If you guys could just kind of talk about what happened after early December when you guys were seeing or expecting trends to be slightly positive. Just want to try to get some color there. 
W. McMullen: If you look at during the quarter, it started out slow when we had the earnings call. It actually during the holidays improved. And in January, it slowed down again. So if you look at during the quarter, that's kind of a cadence within the quarter. I always hate to use weather as an excuse, but we had absolutely no weather benefits this year. Now the negative of that was we had no weather benefits. The positive is next year, if we have any weather at all, we cycle that. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. And if you look at the prior year, we didn't have much weather either. And in fact, the only one big weather event we had was the last weekend of the year in last year's numbers. So our year ended against the only weather event we had in the prior year with no weather this year. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And then tonnage growth cadence remained positive, but it's because of the deflation. But obviously, around the holidays is stronger than the 2 sides of the holiday. 
Shane Higgins: Okay. And then just, Rodney, back to your earlier comments that you guys were a bit more aggressive on your pricing and promotions during the quarter, was that kind of a decision based on some of the insights that you're getting from your customers that you decided to make greater investments in price versus maybe investing in other areas of the store? And were those concentrated in any specific regions in response to the competitive environment out there? Just any color there would be great. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Very -- they were very broad-based. And anything like -- anything that we would do, we would use our insights to decide what our approach is. 
Operator: The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: Just a follow-up on the competitive environment. I think you mentioned earlier you're seeing it from competitors running better stores. What about in the form of pricing or promotions? Are you seeing major changes there since the quarter ended? 
W. McMullen: I wouldn't say changes since the quarter ended. I would say that we definitely are seeing some pricing in certain pockets. I've never tried to calculate it on a percentage basis, but any point in time, you will always have competitors doing things from a pricing standpoint. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. And just a follow-up on some things about your delivery initiatives. You mentioned you'll be expanding Uber in 2017. Wondering if you could speak to that? Is that something that's been driving incremental sales and profitability? And how many stores are covered by Uber at this point in time? And how many do you expect in the future? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Well, it's a pretty small test. We're early in the process. And the same comment that I made earlier about -- on ClickList, it's a headwind, but you can see, as they mature, it becomes where we're neutral in terms of how customer engages with us. In terms of specific numbers that we would expect for this year, we're not to the point where we'd be willing to share it other than obviously, we're working hard to scale it if it makes sense in ways that it makes sense. 
Alvin Concepcion: If I could sneak one in, just related to that, Vitacost, it sounds like you've expanded it with Simple Truth. Just wondering about your future plans to expand beyond Simple Truth into other categories? And is this a preferred delivery method versus Uber? 
W. McMullen: Well, we would look at all the delivery options together and really leaving it up to customer how they want to engage with us. We'll continue to add items to Vitacost that make sense, and the Simple Truth product is obviously the initial part of that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Just 2 quick things. Thanks for the color on the first quarter trends to date. And I was just curious or maybe, Rodney, can you remind us, do delayed tax refunds, are they having an impact on your business? And maybe give us some history on that. And then I have a follow-up question. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On the delayed tax refund, I don't know, Mike. I really don't have very much insight into it. If you look, most of our products aren't as discretionary as some of the other retailers that have talked about it. 
J. Schlotman: And Robbie, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint. My conclusion, without meeting with some other folks and having a conversation, would be that the timing of those doesn't affect us in a big way like it does other folks because over my time here at Kroger, I've never heard anybody talk about I can't wait till tax refunds drop, so we can get a boost in sales. So it just doesn't -- I agree with what Rodney's conclusion, it's based on what most of what we sell. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And the only exception would be like in Alaska where you get paid to live in Alaska, and it's based on the size of the check, based on fuel profits or gasoline profits for the state. 
J. Schlotman: From the pipeline. 
W. McMullen: From the pipeline. And that, you can clearly see when the checks go out and the size of the checks. 
J. Schlotman: And they're year-to-year. But those are all great big Fred Myer stores with a lot of general merchandise. 
Robert Ohmes: Got it. That's helpful. Then just the other question, the Roundy's integration, can you just give us maybe more update on that? And was it a drag to the fourth quarter? And when could Roundy's become a year-over-year sort of tailwind for you guys? 
J. Schlotman: Well, if you look at the -- if you look at Roundy's overall, we continue to be very happy with what Michael Marx and team are doing in Wisconsin as well as Don Rosanova and team in Chicagoland with the 2 banners. Mike and team have cycled through the first set of store remodels and offerings to the customers. They're now the second market getting remodels completed, and then we'll put a full campaign in that market. And then if we continue to see the positive reaction from the customers from ID sales dollars and units, we would expect to continue to roll that out throughout the state. From an ID sales standpoint, it really didn't affect it very much in the quarter, certainly not as much as it did earlier in the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Yes. Rodney, could we start, I just have a big-picture question I mean, if we think back over the years at the analyst meetings that you have had, you used to put up a slide showing the gap between your ID growth and your peers, highlighting, well, it's really been very remarkable, consistent share gains. And as we think about the fourth quarter now and you think about the results that some other players are putting up, specifically Walmart, is a good example, it just doesn't seem like that type of share gain is continuing. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think this momentum's changed and importantly, how is it impacting the way that you're thinking about strategy and specifically the cadence around price investments going forward. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Well, I'll answer the question a little broader than just one specific competitor. But with the comment that I made earlier, there is no doubt, several competitors are improving and running better stores. So that is really clear when you go into their stores, and it's much broader than just Walmart. In terms of the things that we're doing, we're really doubling down on the customer experience. We're getting even more aggressive on process change and taking costs out where it makes sense to take costs out and improving the competitiveness of our model. So it's -- in terms of what are we doing about it, those would be the things that we're doing about it because what we find is certain customers are interested in price, but all they want is a fair price. They're really, really interested in having fresh produce, fresh meat and a great experience, and those are things that we have competitive advantages on. And we'll continue to focus on that, and our store teams and our folks, our associates across the whole company will continue to focus on those. 
Edward Kelly: As we think about the industry now going forward, it certainly seems like the next 5 years could certainly be more challenging than the last 5. Just given what we're hearing from competitors around what they're doing from a pricing perspective, you've talked about players being better at actually just running stores. We've got online to deal with. We've got hard discount to deal with. Do you think that it makes sense that the industry could enter another wave of consolidation? And how are you thinking about M&A versus organic store growth now from here? 
W. McMullen: The -- well, if you look, we would -- I've been around for 30-some years, and I always would tell you that we've always felt that the next 5 years are going to be more competitive than the last 5. I would definitely agree with that comment today. We definitely believe the next 5 will be more competitive than the last 5 because only the strong survive. If you look at in terms of -- we feel very excited about the opportunities that we have to continue to grow our business. And I put it in 2 buckets. Some of it is operational driven where if you look at the historical business that we're in, getting better at that. But if you think about the comments that we -- you hear us increasingly talk about, looking at the opportunity in the $1.5 trillion total food business, we continue to get more and more aggressive in terms of fresh food, fresh food prepared, what's for dinner and picking things up, and that continues to grow well for us. So we really see that, that continues to be a large growth opportunity, and I would say, at the moment, we can see the opportunity more than the things that we're doing. When we were -- when you're out for our Investor Meeting, you saw some of the things we're testing, but we really continue to improve and get better and better about that part of the business. And one of the things that we've been very pleasantly surprised is the willingness that our customers are to eat at one of our stores, and we believe that, that will be an opportunity to grow the business and create a new leg, a platform for growth. So it's really both of those things together. 
Edward Kelly: And M&A, any more or less important for you going forward, do you think? 
W. McMullen: I would say it's kind of the same. If the right opportunity became available, we would be very interested. But we don't -- we haven't changed in terms of we design a model where M&A is not required. And if the right opportunity becomes available, we would sit down and talk to somebody. But it's not something that we're out proactively trying to change that. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: My question was previously asked, so I'll pass it on to someone else. 
Operator: Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. 
Kelly Bania: Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about volume as of late. I think there's been -- our industry data and a lot of industry data seems to suggest some pretty weak volumes, and I think a lot of that data's skewed towards center store categories. But I'm just curious what your assessment is if you feel like you're seeing any similar surprisingly weakness in volume, particularly quarter-to-date. And if you think it has anything to do with channel shifting or changing consumer behavior or just maybe a result of this prolonged deflationary environment. 
W. McMullen: Well, yes, we continue to see very much where people are increasingly spending money in the fresh departments. So there is no doubt there's a shift in tonnage from the center store to the perimeter of the store, and that's been a long-term shift. And that hasn't changed. If you look at the center store, we would still see tonnage growth there. But remember, natural and organic is part of what's driving that growth, and natural and organic is not -- there's very few public companies where you can just see that by itself. And if you look at even for us, Mike talked about our total natural and organic business at about $16 billion. Our Simple Truth brand by itself is $1.7 billion of that, so over 10%, and those are things that you really don't see in some of the other measures. So the center store has been soft for a long period of time, but we've continued to gain share in the center store, and we also have continued to change the mix of what's inside the center store. 
J. Schlotman: And different category reinventions with coffee and pet and baby where we've totally redone the look and feel of those departments for our customer. 
Kelly Bania: Got it. That's helpful, and then, I guess, just lastly, the shift to IRI, is there any reason or anything you can tell us about kind of making that shift from Nielsen to IRI? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we announced earlier in the year a new relationship with IRI that we didn't talk about a whole lot, and it's really just furthering that relationship with them. And they have a few nuggets of data that Nielsen may not have that we think is going to be helpful to us overall as we look at our volume in the overall food industry, not just the grocery store industry. 
W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Thank you for continuing to connect with our customers every day. They are rewarding us with their business. With your help, we gained more of the market and improved our customer satisfaction scores in 2016. Thank you for your hard work. For those associates who are choosing to accept the voluntary retirement offer, thank you for your contributions to Kroger. I know for some the decision to retire was not an easy one. You should know Kroger would not be the company it is today without your years of dedicated service. Each of you has made a difference in the lives of our customers, our communities and each other, and we are very grateful for all of your contributions. Thank you.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2016-12-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead. 
J. Schlotman: Thanks. Kate couldn't be with us here this morning, so I will wish you the good morning, and thank you for joining us. 
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of the cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. 
 A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. 
 We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.
 Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.
 Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continue to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. 
 A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. 
 As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. 
 But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51° is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. 
 We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. 
 Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. 
 Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. 
 Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in the third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. 
 We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. 
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to $0.188 last year. 
 During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. 
 Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. 
 Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. 
 The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16% for the third quarter of 2015. 
 I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. 
 We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. 
 Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. 
 We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. 
 We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. 
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are both clear-eyed about the challenges before us and optimistic about Kroger's future. Transitions are no fun, but they do create opportunities to improve the way we run our business. We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers and our associates. We'll continue to accelerate our adoption of technology to deliver additional value, to provide convenience for and to our customers and take costs out, as Mike mentioned. All these things set us up to grow our business. We have a unique opportunity for strong growth in the $1.5 trillion U.S. food market. Our best days are still ahead of us. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Just one quick question for clarification. I know you wrote this, but I have received a couple of questions on it. When you're guiding to below 8% EPS growth in fiscal '17, is it reasonable to assume that's on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the benefit of the 53rd week? 
J. Schlotman: Well, it does exclude the benefit of the 53rd week. Basically, the way we business plan is just like you said, like-for-like. And then we go in and estimate what the 53rd week will ultimately add to that result. I'm not going to go to, am I going to be at 8% or 9% with the 53rd week, because I -- that would tell you what we're thinking about without the 53rd week. But the below -- the only guidance we're giving is that on a 52-week basis, we would be below the 8%. 
Kenneth Goldman: Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, I wanted to follow up. On CNBC, you were sort of, at least to my ears, talking about maybe deflation ebbing a little bit here. You were pointing to some commodities maybe rising. But you're also guiding, I guess, to a similar operating environment well into fiscal '17. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I understood. If deflation's the primary reason for the challenging environment today, and if you think deflation is going to get less bad, then why wouldn't early 2017's operating environment be a little bit less bad than what we're kind of seeing right now? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, what I was going through on CNBC is where some of the raw material markets are trending over the last 4 weeks. A lot of those, when you look at them on year-on-year, they're still quite negative. But there is some trend up in some of those categories in the input costs over the last 4 weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from that bottom and a slight blip up in those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. And we have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. And if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what's in the back of our minds. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: It's Steve Forbes on for John today. Given the pace of the ClickList and ExpressLane rollout thus far this year and the uptick over the past couple of weeks you mentioned, can you touch on what your thoughts are for 2017 as it relates to these initiatives? 
W. McMullen: We wouldn't be, at this point, sharing specifics, but obviously, it's something that continues to be important and we'll continue to roll it out. Now at some point, it will slow down a little bit just because the stores that are easy to add, we will have added them. We have identified overall how many stores we think makes sense, and it's over half of our stores we think would make sense to have ClickList. But obviously, you do the easier ones first, and it will slow down just because of the difficulty getting it installed. 
Steven Forbes: And then as a follow up, maybe kind of a bigger picture question about what you've seen historically as it relates to the return to an inflationary cycle, right. If you think about the competitive environment today, how do you think about '17, right, if we do get that eventual reinflation cycle? After such an extended period of deflation, I mean, do you foresee yourself and competitors rapidly passing through price increases once inflation returns? Or in the context of what we've experienced in the past and what we're experiencing now, is there any risk, right, that price increases occur on a slower basis than we may expect? 
W. McMullen: It's a great question. And obviously, looking back over the last 20 years or so -- what do they say? Every short statements in economics is wrong. So part of it depends on how does it come back? Does it come back with a vengeance? Or is it just 2% or 3%? At this point, we would expect for the inflation, when it becomes inflationary, for it to be pretty modest on the things that we're seeing. But remember that comment, we're very early, so that would be a very early expectation, but you don't know until you're in it. I think everybody from a competitive standpoint is looking at what's going on in the market. So typically, you'll lag a little bit at the front end, but then everybody will pass it through. And that's the reason why you'll always hear me talk about the transition periods are difficult, both going in and coming out of inflation, deflation. 
Steven Forbes: But the pace of increase, I guess, what you expect as you look out to '17 is very dependent on where the absolute level of inflation returns to. 
W. McMullen: Absolutely. And right now, like on the -- things that are grain-based, obviously, those crops, for the most part, haven't been planted yet. You'll have some winter wheat that's in that process. But crops will be a heavy driver of that inflation, and it's still way too early. I think, what, in '16, it appears that this will be a record crop for 5 years in a row. At some point, you're going to not have great weather. 
J. Schlotman: Never had 6. 
W. McMullen: I don't think we've ever had 5 before. So you never know. But there isn't anything that we see out there that would cause us to have a different point of view. Now obviously, in produce, that is -- that will change very quickly depending -- the growing seasons are much shorter there. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: So can I just start asking about guidance and just a little bit more color. So at the Analyst Day, you reaffirmed full year guidance, but openly admitted, right, that the end of Q3 was difficult to judge. Today, you ended up lowering the outlook a bit. I guess what's changed since the Analyst Day? If you could sort of like provide a bit more detail there. Is it really just the conclusion that the end of Q3 was softer than really what you were thinking? And then how is Q4 shaping up so far quarter-to-date on IDs? Are you at that point of low -- up -- low single digits? 
J. Schlotman: So if you think about the -- where we've been at -- from the Analyst Day and transitioning through that, I would actually encourage you to step back a bit from that and look at it at a little bit bigger lens. It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points. When you're plus or minus $23 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, or even $40 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, when you're at 4% or 4.5% idents, it's a blip on the radar screen. When you're between 0 -- when you're between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it's a huge percentage move on where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, and it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continues to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, just those 3 commodities, because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don't get a 2-year bump in it. 
W. McMullen: Yes, I would just add a little bit to Mike's comment. When Mike shared the guidance at our Analyst Day, he did talk about the uncertainty because of the calendar shifts. So there is -- what -- where we ended up was exactly consistent with what -- how Mike outlined in terms of the uncertainty for the balance of a few days. When you look at quarter-to-date in the fourth quarter, we would be slightly negative. But if you look at last year, last year's -- the first 4 weeks of last year's fourth quarter were by far the strongest, and it kept getting weaker during the quarter. So we will start cycling numbers from a year ago that look a lot different than what we've been cycling so far this year. So that's the reason why we were comfortable on giving the guidance in terms of being slightly positive for the fourth quarter. 
Edward Kelly: Great, and just a follow-up. On the gross margin, I guess, Rodney and Mike, your gross margin this period of -- this deflationary cycle, I guess, has been, I guess, remarkably resilient given sort of like what you've seen historically in terms of the relationship between the margin and IDs. And the competitive environment, from what we hear, right, sounds like it's more difficult. Can you just give us a sense as to what's really going on in the underlying gross margin? I mean, I know you continually invest in price, but it doesn't seem like you're being as impacted by the competitive environment as what we've seen at other places. And any color there would be great in sort of like how you think about that over the next few quarters as well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments and let Mike finish it. First of all, when you look at having Roundy's and not having Roundy's, that affected some of the year-over-year change because Roundy's has a higher gross margin than the Kroger-based, Kroger company. The other thing is that our buying teams have done a ton of work on changing the way we buy product in terms of cost of goods. And if you look, we have a lot of corporate brand products where we buy direct. So a lot of those changes have really been helpful in terms of making improvement in cost of goods, too, which has helped some on the cost -- the gross margin line. I know Mike, you -- I'm sure you have a couple of other comments you want to add. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I think the one I would go a little deeper on is the corporate brands. And as we continue to have an expansion of our Private Selection line, when you look at Simple Truth continuing to grow nearly -- basically, double digits, those kinds of products contain a higher gross margin as well. And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat distorts the historical reference. The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of the dairy complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's in there is the fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix. Now their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers. And it's something that we've -- been our cornerstone for the last 14 years. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So I wanted to kind of take a different direction here a little bit and talk more about the nonfresh, maybe even the branded side, the branded -- which some of the data coming out lately has shown volumes are just negative in the measured channel. And then also inquire about e-commerce, you've obviously seen Walmart buy Jet.com. Amazon is making some big inroads all of a sudden into some of these consumable categories, these everyday essential categories. And just in that context, get your guys' perspective on what's going to happen with margins, what's going to happen with these categories and how do you react to an environment that seems to changing pretty quickly? 
W. McMullen: Well, there's about 10 questions within that. So I'm trying to... 
J. Schlotman: So you don't get a follow up, Scott. 
W. McMullen: I'll try to summarize it in such a way that it's helpful. When you look at our relationships with the CPGs, it would be -- our business, with most of those CPG partners, would continue to grow. And the trends that they would be seeing overall, for the most part, the trends we would be seeing is different. In terms of -- at our Analyst Day, we increasingly see competition much broader than we would have in the past. And we're really focused on, how do we give the customer what they want when they want it in the way they want it? And Amazon is one way of doing that. But not every customer wants to have 10 boxes of stuff sitting in front of their door all day. What we find is a lot of customers love having groceries picked -- picking it up. And we're starting to test, obviously, we -- partnering with third parties to deliver. So for us, we're really focused on the customer and letting the customer decide how to engage and doing it in a way that's seamless. We've always said that we believe margins over time will continue to decline from a gross profit margin standpoint. And that's the reason why we worked so hard to get costs out, partner with 84.51° in using -- and partnering with our technology teams to fundamentally change the way we do work to get costs out. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add? 
J. Schlotman: No, and I -- one of the things -- I agree 100% with Rodney on the e-commerce relative to deliveries and being on your porch. And where we're situated, our customers live within 2 or 3 miles of the store they most regularly shop in. And it's extremely convenient for them to order online and make that stop by the store on their way to and from either work or daily activities. And the easiest way to see if a retailer is excited about something is, are they doing more of it or less of it? And as Rodney said, we continue to roll more ClickList locations out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. 
Sean Kras: This is Sean on for Karen. Can you guys provide -- can you provide some color on tonnage trends this quarter versus the first 2 quarters of the year? 
J. Schlotman: Tonnage trends continue to be positive for the quarter. I would -- there is some softening from the second quarter to the third quarter in tonnage. But overall, we're -- we continue to have positive tonnage, and we continue to grow our share. In some of the categories, we're very pleased with the tonnage growth we're seeing. It's -- tonnage is a little bit of a difficult animal to get your arms around because there are so many pack-size changes. Today -- it used to be, you bought a -- well, you didn't even buy bottled water, and then you bought a 12-pack of bottled water, then you bought 24-pack of bottled water. Now you buy a 32-pack of bottled water. All of those are 1 unit, even though we're selling more bottled water units. And there's a lot of multipacks and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity. You also see some of that with ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their basket cart with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the basket cart. It's just -- as long as their trunk can hold it, it's okay. We continue to be pleased with our tonnage growth. It's something we know is the fundamental piece of what is core to our business. 
Sean Kras: Okay, that's helpful. Then, I guess, my follow-up would be just some color on extra week next year and the impact to earnings per share. We went back and looked at 2012 as sort of a proxy for that and thought that the merchant flow-through would -- maybe equates about $0.09 a share. Just wondering if you could give some comments on that. 
J. Schlotman: Well, one extra week out of 52 is a little over 1.9%. The gives and takes of that and what happens inside that week drive what the benefit of it is. But historically, it's -- I would agree that it's somewhere in that range, but it's difficult to understand what's going to happen in the first week of late January, early February of 2018. 
W. McMullen: We do always try to break that out and provide that insight because we don't take credit for that extra week in terms of achieving numbers. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we are in the middle of our business plan process and just wanted to give you a little bit of flavor of what we're seeing next year's shape up to be and letting people know the 53rd week, we're not taking credit for achieving the numbers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. 
Zachary Fadem: You mentioned several times during the call, just a focus going forward on taking costs out. Can you talk a little bit about what this means for things like employee costs, wages, health care, store productivity initiatives, pension, stuff like that? 
W. McMullen: I would say probably all of those -- all of the above are things that we're working on. One of the things that we've been able to do over the last several years is through process change, changing the way work is done. And we continue to see great opportunities there. And we're really working hard on partnering with our R&D team and our technology team to take things -- to change the way we do work. And I know Mike at our investor meeting talked a little bit about temperature monitoring. And temperature monitoring, for example, is something that we developed internally with our R&D team. We've rolled it out, and it saves about $25 million a year in terms of just what it costs to execute it. Obviously, it takes capital to do that. So the first year doesn't create too much value, but the second year and beyond is great value. So labor is always the area where there's the most opportunity. We will do those savings there through process changes. We think it's incredibly important. 
Zachary Fadem: Okay. And just a follow-up. I know it's still early days here, but are there any metrics you can provide on the performance of your ClickList stores? Maybe is there data to suggest that sales are incremental? And do you view ClickList as a potential driver of market share or rather just an added convenience for your customers over time? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'll try -- obviously, we're very, very early, so I won't be able to answer all of the questions you asked. They're great questions. It's just that we're so early in the process. It would be some growing share and some just one more convenience for the customer. And it's really a mix of both, and each customer would be a different combination of that mix. What we believe over time is that it starts teaching us how do we deliver what the customer wants, the way they want it, when they want it. So we think it's something that's even more important than just ClickList per se in terms of teaching us how to connect with the customer even deeper and in a better way for them. Some of the business is incremental. It's a reasonably high range when you look across the company. If you look at the financial performance, it's a headwind initially. If you go back and look at some of the original locations that Harris Teeter had before we merged, it becomes where you're indifferent whether somebody shops via ClickList or in the store. But if you look at the stores overall, it's still a reasonable, significant headwind in terms of rolling out ClickList from a financial standpoint. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: I just wanted to drill down a little bit on your ID sales by region. Did you guys see any significant regional differences in ID sales during the quarter? Anything that you could call out? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We always see ID sales ranges by region. When we're in 30-something states plus D.C., it's like anything else, there's somebody that's at the top of the list and somebody at the bottom of the list. We typically don't go into specific geographic descriptions of where we saw relative strength and where we saw relative weakness, if you will, or towards the bottom end. Broad-based, again, I would say the story is pretty much the same for all of the regions with the persistent deflation. And a continued focus on trying to drive tonnage is the story that we're trying to drive home with all of our geographies. 
Shane Higgins: Okay, that's helpful. And I know you guys earlier in the year, you talked about Roundy's as being a 30 basis point headwind to the comp. But obviously, you're going to cycle that in fourth quarter. Is that -- first of all, is that about right? Was it -- has it been around 30 basis points? And as we do cycle that, do you guys expect that to help contribute to the comp improvement as the fourth quarter progresses? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you think about Roundy's even more broadly than that, it is still in that same kind of a range. We've talked about that we've gone into 13 stores in Wisconsin and have done those stores the way we want them done. And we continue to be very pleased with the sales and tonnage growth inside those stores. We've also converted those 13 stores to our -- to the Kroger systems, which, for us, relative to a merger, is lighting speed because we want to get them integrated into our -- all of our processes as quickly as possible. We remain very excited about that merger and the potential we see. Particularly, the Wisconsin assets I think is -- if you will, if you think about it in purely economic terms, is the optionality of that merger. Getting into Chicago for the cost of the entire merger was great. And as Wisconsin with Michael Marx and his team running Wisconsin, that will continue to be a very positive thing for us in the future. It's not going to turn on a dime. It's a lot of hard work, but the team up there is up to the challenge. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The one thing that -- and you've heard me say this before, the thing that I've really been pleased with in Mariano's and the Wisconsin stores with Pick 'n Save and Copps and Metro are the engagement of our store associates and how supportive they've been and how excited they've been. And the changes that we're making, we're seeing a little bit more improvement in tonnage than we are in identical sales results, just because some of the changes deflate the retail prices. But I'm just thrilled and delighted with our teams and the way our teams are engaging and excited about being part of the Kroger team, and much more so than I would have expected this early in the process. 
Shane Higgins: All right. I appreciate that color. So just in terms of kind of thinking over the next year or 2, so this is going to be something that, obviously, Mike, you said, you guys have done some conversion. You still have a lot more to go. So this would be something that will probably be a multi-quarter effort. We shouldn't expect to see any significant tailwinds then from Roundy's over the next couple of quarters [ph]. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I -- It's clearly something -- it's -- we're coming up on the 1-year anniversary of the closure of the merger. I think it was December 18 of last year. So it's very new part of our book of business. And it is going to be something that over time will continue to be worked on. I wouldn't -- I can tell you, part of our business plan process is not a tailwind from Wisconsin in 2017; individual stores, yes, but overall, no. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Andrew Ruben: This is Andrew Ruben on for Vinny. I just had a question on deflation, bigger picture. You characterized being in mid-cycle. Just curious what drives that characterization. And given that you've been through a few of these cycles, as you referenced, any color on how the cycle that we're in compares to the few you've experienced over the past 30 years? 
W. McMullen: Well, the -- the bigger picture is it probably looks the most like the one in 2002. That one, really, it was about 5 quarters. And if you look at when it was the worst is in the middle of it, and that's kind of where we are. Part of it will -- part of it determines what -- I'm trying to think about how to word this in a way that's helpful. The cycle coming out will be driven by what caused you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it. Everything that we can see, the reason what we would expect today would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once -- and Mike talked about it a little bit, like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3. And that's the reason why the pressures decreases. I don't know, Mike, anything else you want to add that? 
J. Schlotman: No. 
W. McMullen: Andrew, is that helpful? 
Andrew Ruben: That is. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So the first question I had was just on traffic. Your press release, it sounds like in your press release, you again had positive household -- loyal households growth. I just want to get a sense, as you look at your traffic this quarter or this, I guess, Q3, were there any changes versus what you saw in Q2? I just want to get a sense on how traffic played out versus your expectations. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at it versus expectations, it's pretty similar. It continues to be positive. In terms of playing out, you always want more traffic than you had, but I would have said that every quarter. I don't know, Mike, from your perspective. I think it really well played out the way we would expect. 
J. Schlotman: I agree with you. 
W. McMullen: We felt like third quarter would be a very tough quarter, given everything that what was going on. And -- but you start cycling some of those things as well. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then for gas margins. I just want to get a sense what your outlook is for the balance of the year. And as you think about where gas fuel margins could end up for this year, do you expect to be back at your historical average on the fuel margin line? 
J. Schlotman: Fuel has certainly been a wild ride the last few years and even in the last few even days and weeks as -- is OPEC going to do something? Is OPEC not going to do something? And they ultimately did the 32.5 billion -- or billion gallon decline -- barrel decline, 32.5 billion barrel. I put the b on the dollar -- the number instead of the barrel. That equates to 500,000 barrels a day. And to see the wild swings down $1.50 one day, up almost $4 the next day is kind of confusing on what's -- when you look at that relative to worldwide supply of oil is relatively modest amount of production cut. That said, volatility, up and down. Volatility is generally very positive for us because we have many, many fuel centers at our supermarket locations that get not just a delivery a day, but some of them get a couple of deliveries a day. So when there's daily volatility like that, it allows us to take advantage of market fluctuations. 
W. McMullen: Yes. When we do our business planning process, we always just use the 5-year rolling average. We find that's as close as anything else. I think Mike mentioned, if you look at over a rolling 4 quarter to a rolling 4 quarter, fuel margins are down just shy of a couple of cents. But for us, anybody's guess is as good as anybody else's. And I always get a kick out of -- if gas is at $100 a barrel, it's going to $150. And if it's at $50, it's going to $20. Neither of which have ever been right. But we just, in terms of the way we do our planning process, we look at a 5-year rolling average. When we look at, do our shareholders get a return for us being in that business, we also do the same thing. 
J. Schlotman: And we essentially business plan the nonfuel business, add the fuel business on, and then, of course, this -- we'll then add the 53rd week on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Rodney, for people like me who were not covering this industry back in '02, I was hoping you could maybe give us some insights. How does this deflation and promo environment change the way your customer is shopping? Or does it? Like for example, you called out snacks and drinks, maybe some color on other categories. Or also, does sort of the balance of fill-in versus stock-up change? How does the reaction to promos change in sort of a multi-quarter deflationary environment? And maybe some color on what happens in center-of-store when you're in an environment like this? And I have to ask because I don't think anybody did, but just the question you love getting, what's Walmart doing right now promotionally? Are they investing more and more in price in the markets you're in? 
W. McMullen: Okay. Well, if you look at the '02 versus today, probably the biggest change from a customer standpoint, I guess, it would be 2 things. One, obviously, they buy food that's already prepared much more. And when we shared everything at our Investor Day, you could see a lot of the changes that we've done in terms of having food that you can come to one of stores and eat at the store or take home and eat. That, obviously, is a huge change today versus '02. If you look at the things that are -- and I guess, the other big change is customers shop more frequently but smaller baskets. So if you go back then, and we didn't have a loyalty card, and we didn't have the analysis we do today. But everything we could find, the customer would -- the basket would be bigger on an individual basis. But if you look at a monthly basis, it's bigger today. In terms of the cycle comments, the things that we think are the same are more the materials in raw ingredients space, where if you look at beef and pork and chicken, the biggest component of that is corn price. And chicken in that cycle is much quicker than it is on pork and beef. And that hasn't changed now versus 2002. So it's really what's the raw materials themselves and how's the growing crops doing and how does that flow through the supply chain. And that would have the biggest effect on some of the proteins and some of the center store components. I don't know, Mike, on inflation, anything that... 
J. Schlotman: No, I think you covered it. 
W. McMullen: Both of us were around in '02 as well. We had different jobs. 
J. Schlotman: I think you covered landscape. Well, you did, I didn't. 
Robert Ohmes: Maybe, guys, just on -- if you think back to '02, I don't know if you can remember, but in terms of promotionally how the competition reacted, has that changed a lot? Is it -- is there more in-store signage? Or is it more circulars? Or what are the promotional tactics that are being used right now out there? And is it similar or different than '02 from the competition? 
W. McMullen: Well, on the promotional stuff, the -- you would -- in '02, and this is going off of a lot of memory without having the data in front of me. But competitors then didn't have as much insights, and they didn't know if it was just because somebody was getting their sales or if it was deflation. Today, people have much better data. So they understand it's things that's going on in the overall marketplace. It's not some competitor getting the business. So all of us reacted in a different kind of way at the front end of deflation back then because you thought a competitor was getting the business. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, and that parallels Rodney's comment on basket size. Historically, all we would see is what's the average transaction per customer. And if that's softening, back in '02 when you didn't have the data, you didn't know that that household was coming more times in a monthly basis and it wound up spending more with you on a month because we simply didn't have that technology back then. 
Robert Ohmes: Got it. That's helpful. And just quickly, Walmart, any color on any changes in their level of price investment? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It would be similar to what we've seen before in terms of our comments. As you know, we won't talk too much about specific competitors. We have a ton of respect for them. There is no doubt they continue to improve. But that's the same comments I made at the investor call and I made at the last quarter. And all of us would have different approaches in different regions of the country. 
Operator: And our last question will come from William Kirk of RBC. 
William Kirk: So I'm still a little confused about the end of the third quarter. If ID sales have been running at essentially 0.5 with 2 weeks left and finished at 0.1, does that imply the last 2 weeks were down 2%? And then taking the calendar commentary, does that imply Halloween sales or sales associated with Halloween are down, too, thanks to moving from a weekday to a -- or moving from a weekend to a weekday? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't know if I'll get that precise in answering the question because daily fluctuations are always dangerous because of things like you cited, Halloween moving between days. I don't think we said that we were absolutely at the low end of our 50 basis points to 150 basis points ID guidance. We said we were near it, and it's actually -- in our original guidance for that, we expect that the third quarter to not get to the low end, but the fourth quarter to be above the low end to bring us inside that range. And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it's -- maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back to, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you're in this range, if I missed those 4 days that were left by $20 million, that cuts my ID sales in half if I was at 20 basis points. If I'm at 4%, it goes to 3.9%, and it's not a very big deal. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, William. 
 Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Being part of millions of families' celebrations this holiday season is a great honor and privilege. Our customers count on us to have what they need and more, and you make it all happen. Just last week, nearly 10.5 million customers shopped with us on Tuesday and 13.5 million on Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That's incredible. A huge thank you. No matter where you work, you make the holidays special for our customers, our communities and each other. 
 I also want to thank our store teams for their outstanding response to our national hiring event in November for all military veterans and family members. We hired 4,000 veterans and family members in one day, which is nearly 3,000 more than last year's event. We are delighted to welcome them to our Kroger family as part of our continuing commitment to active duty troops and the nation's 23 million veterans. Thank you for all you do every day. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and your family. 
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2016-09-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 Please save the date for our 2016 Investor Conference, which will be held in Cincinnati on November 1 and 2. Details will be coming soon, and we hope that you can join us.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.
 By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected.
 The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.
 In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.
 While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.
 While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.
 To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.
 We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.
 Our team at 84.51° helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.
 A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.
 Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.
 We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.
 We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm.
 Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.
 One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family.
 A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.
 Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
 I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.
 We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.
 Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.
 There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.
 Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
 As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.
 As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.
 Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.
 A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by a lower-than-expected affected income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
 Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.
 Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.
 During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.
 Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.
 Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.
 Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
 I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
 In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.
 In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.
 Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.
 Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are in this for the long term whether it is our sustainability initiatives, job creation or return to shareholders. None of these are short-term ventures or quick fixes. We've been through business cycles like this before, and we know the best and right thing to do is to deliver on our promise today while investing for the future.
 We are as committed as ever to our Customer 1st Strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So maybe you can talk about how you guys -- and obviously you've got a lot of data, how you think about the analytics around price elasticity in a deflationary environment versus inflationary, right, in trying to get a decent, at least short-term ROIC. And then -- and contrast that with maybe what you're seeing in the marketplace competitively. Because it always struck me that, right, when you have a deflationary environment and your costs are going down, people can be a little more irrational and make poor decisions, right, because their COGS are going down. So curious how you look at that and what you're seeing from your competition. 
W. McMullen: Well, the -- thanks. The -- it's a great question, and it's a little hard to answer because each category would be a little different. And if you look at some of the beef and pork categories, people are moving back into those categories in a very, very strong way, and we have incredible tonnage growth in those areas. So the elasticity, you have tons. Other categories where people kind of buy what they need all the time anyway, you don't see as much. So if you think about eggs, for an example, people only eat a certain number of eggs. But some of the other categories would be a little different. The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out because -- it's fascinating. In our research, most people are saying their basket of goods cost more money, but we, in fact, know that it isn't. So helping the customer see that is always a challenge for us and our competitors as well. Go ahead, John. 
John Heinbockel: No, that's good. 
W. McMullen: And when you look at the competition, it's kind of the same as what we've always had in each -- one of the -- what do they say in each short statement in economics is wrong because if you look across the country, you have competitors doing all kinds of different things depending on what's going on in their business and what's going on in that part of the country. So there really isn't a consistency to it that I would say it's completely different today than before. 
John Heinbockel: Yes. Well, good, as a follow-up, because you guys always talked about -- you felt competition has not changed. It was rigorous but not irrational. I mean, it just looks like there are pockets of irrationality. And I wondered, is that true? And particularly in protein, is that made worse in the Memorial Day to Labor Day time period because that's kind of prime beef season? And then so post Labor Day, that should calm down or no? 
W. McMullen: The -- I guess, I'm a little -- I wouldn't be quite as aggressive on saying people are being irrational because I don't see anything that is different today than when you go back and look at it over the last year or 3 years or 5 years. And you always have certain pockets where people are doing something different than overall. I'm just trying to think from a Labor Day standpoint and some of the ads, I wouldn't say that there was something drastically different than what... 
J. Schlotman: So like the holiday ad. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And you're going to put in the ad the things that the customers want for that period of time. And to your comment, certainly, people grill out a lot more on that weekend just because it's kind of the last major weekend of summer. 
Operator: The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: So Rodney, I just wanted to follow-up on John's question because there has been, I guess, a fair amount of talk now from, I guess, food retailing competitors about conventional grocery stores getting much more aggressive from a promotional standpoint. We -- there's also been plenty of talk about Walmart being more aggressive within the marketplace as well. You're kind of suggesting that you don't see as much of that. So I'm just wondering where that disconnect maybe would come from. And then as part of all that, could you just talk about what you are seeing so far in your third quarter, both from the perspective of your ID growth and the general promotional cadence of your business? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at competitors, the thing that you really have to look at is you have to look at across the whole country. You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that. As you know, we have a basket of goods that we look at on almost a weekly basis in terms of how is our pricing relative to our strategy and relative to our competition. And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then a really critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's -- as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy. If you look at what's within it, though, it has changed over time as customers change. So if you look at natural and organics, when we started the journey, natural and organics really wasn't a critical part of the product strategy. Today, it's incredibly important. And I don't know, Mike, it's probably, what, 10% or a little over 10% of our business when you look at it in total. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, definitely over 10%. 
W. McMullen: So those are -- elements, I think, are equally important. When you look at where we are so far in the third quarter, obviously, we're early in the quarter. We would be at the low end of the range on identical sales growth, but we're still very early in the quarter. 
Edward Kelly: I think it's -- right, let me ask a question... 
J. Schlotman: And also keep in mind, the third quarter is a tough compare for us with the -- in the face of deflationary pressures on the top line. It was a mid-5s quarter last year in the third quarter. So combination of a very strong ID sales quarter last year and deflation last year is certainly a factor on where we are and where we'll wind up. 
Edward Kelly: Let me just ask the question maybe a different way. Like if we look back at the last period of meaningful deflation, it was obviously a tough period for the industry from a promotional standpoint. If I look at your guidance, it seems to imply there is probably not much deterioration in the gross margin baked in. We sort of look at your numbers historically over a long period of time. I don't think I've ever seen ID growth as low as it's now going to be in the back half of the year without seeing that. We're hearing sort of pockets of more aggressive promotions. I guess, what I'm really trying to understand, Rodney, is why this period is going to be different, why the movie that we saw in 2009 doesn't play out the same way. Because I think just from looking at your numbers and what I'm hearing from you, that's what you're anticipating. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And when you look at from most of the elements we can see at this moment, we would expect it to look pretty similar to '09. If you look at back in '09, the identicals would be similar. I think we were at 1.3% and 1.8% or something like that. I don't remember for sure. 
J. Schlotman: 1.3% and 1.2% in the third and fourth quarter. 
W. McMullen: Yes. So both of those would be within the range where we've given for the balance of the year. We would certainly expect -- typically, you do see a little bit more promotional activity early in inflation cycles just because the competitors think they're losing share versus it's a fact that it's deflation. And we would certainly include some of those elements in terms of where we expected things to be for the balance of the year. But everything that we can see, '09 would be the most similar. And if you look at '09, there were 3 quarters of deflation. If you go back and actually look at 2002, there were 4 quarters of deflation. So those are kind of the points that we're using for references. 
Operator: And the next question is from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: And actually, just following a little bit on Ed's question. The deflation that we're seeing today, do you think we're really in a similar situation as in 2009? I mean, at that time, I recall we were cycling some pretty high inflation in '08. That's not really the situation today. Just inflation wasn't very high last year. The economy today is expanding, albeit slowly. So this environment does feel a little bit different. I mean, do you think if we stay in a more sustained deflationary environment that the promotional environment could intensify from here? I don't know, any thoughts you guys have on that would be great. 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's kind of fascinating, your question. I mean, if you look at over the last 8 or 9 years, if you look at inflation on a rolling 5-year basis, the range is 2% to 3% on a rolling 5 years. Now if you look at it in terms of swings, we had deflation of basically 1% or so, and this includes pharmacy, I should add, up to inflation of 6%. And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth and those elements, and those are the things that we're looking at to see do we think it's different this time. 
Shane Higgins: All right. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean, given that you guys have such a strong private-label portfolio, I believe, Rodney, you said it was 27% of units during the quarter. Does this give you guys some additional flexibility in periods of inflation and deflation in terms of maybe being able to pass along some of the lower costs more quickly? Any color that you guys could give there will be great. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit, Shane. For us, corporate brands is a huge, important critical part of our strategy and a very important competitive advantage. And it starts with what products are we offering and what's the quality of those products and the value for those products. We find it always an advantage from a competitive standpoint because if national brands do something that's noneconomic, our corporate brands pick up share. So we find them -- our customers love them, and they vote by buying a lot of them. We also find that it's way of keeping the market honest. We certainly would have an advantage in terms of understanding the true economic cost to produce something, and retail pricing would be based on that true economic cost. 
Shane Higgins: And then actually just like -- I'd like to squeeze just one more in. Are you guys working pretty closely with your vendor partners in this period to try to -- since you guys understand the cost so well to try to get the best prices? And how are those conversations going? 
W. McMullen: Yes, always. And as you know, we always look at the CPG companies as partners. And I obviously go to quite a few meetings where the CPG partners and Kroger meet. And a lot of times, it's hard to figure out who works for who, which I view as a positive. Both of us are trying to drive volume and trying to drive profitability, and most of the CPG teams have a responsibility for part of our profit as well. So I don't see those discussions changing. There are healthy respect, but there are also healthy negotiations that go on. And I don't sense a change in that basic approach. And the other thing that we always feel that we are able to provide the best insights for CPG companies on introducing new items, what's the success, what customers are buying, and we try to work with those partners to grow their business as well. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just want to go back to your comments, Rodney, on the U.S. consumer. It sounded more down -- deep to me versus prior quarters. Just want to get a sense, if you look at your business, are you actually seeing consumers pull back on discretionary spending? Or is that just based on the surveys that you move the consumers more cautious? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the areas that we would consider discretionary like high-value wine, Boar's Head, Starbucks, Murray's Cheese, all of those areas, they continue to have nice growth. The comments I made are more based on the surveys that we -- where we survey customers almost every day and the changes in terms of what the customers tell us they anticipate will happen. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then switching topics to inflation, deflation. What are you building in for the balance of the year on the deflation front? And is it fair to say that at this point, you're assuming that deflation will continue through at least the early part of next year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We did not provide a point estimate or a range in our 8-K that we filed this morning. We only talked about the fact that we expect to see product cost deflation for the balance of the year. And as Rodney said, it could extend into early next year as well in his prepared comments. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. I'm going to sneak in one last one. From a tonnage perspective, has your tonnage growth been consistent with prior quarters? Or has it -- or did you see any change this period? 
J. Schlotman: We continue to be very pleased with our tonnage growth. It's positive. There's a lot of things that go on inside tonnage growth. There's mixed pack changes. There are certain categories where we've gone to multipack units, bigger selling units of multiple items in the same package. We continue to be very, very bullish about our ability to grow tonnage. Rather, we try to avoid giving an exact measure because it's much as an art as a science, but it's something we're fundamentally focused on. We had nice tonnage growth, and we continue to have market share growth in the quarter as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Tanal: Just to follow-up on that last question a little bit. So the data that we're looking at, I guess, would suggest that input cost deflation should be moderating a bit into the back half. Do you think that, that's accurate or at all? And how do you see the retail side of this playing out from here? Do you have any expectations for how long this typically -- this kind of thing typically would last? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you'd look at how long it lasts, the only insight that I could provide is the comment I made a little earlier. If you go back and look at 2009, it was 3 quarters. If you go back to 2002, it was 4 quarters. We've had inflation every quarter other than those since the first quarter of 2002 as how far back we went. On terms of moderating, as you get toward the latter part of the year and early next year, you're starting to cycle the deflation. So I would -- certainly, we would guess that it would start to moderate just because you're starting to cycle some of the deflation. And an awful lot of the deflation is driven because of commodity pricing. And that would be the reason why -- that we would believe that it would start moderating. And then when you start cycling, it was -- we don't expect it to be negative on top of negative for a long period of time. 
Stephen Tanal: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Now is that at all part of sort of the guide here? As you say, you're sort of tracking toward the lower end of the back half guide. Or do you -- would you say that, that dynamic reflects your expectation of improvement in retail? Or would you say it's more about the compare? How would you describe that? 
W. McMullen: Yes, why don't you say it... 
J. Schlotman: There's a little distraction here in the room. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Stephen, if you don't mind asking the question again because all of a sudden, we had extra voice in the room. 
Stephen Tanal: Yes, of course. The guidance for IDs, being at the low end now versus obviously a bit of a higher range or a higher midpoint, is that more reflective of your expectation of improvement in retail prices or more about just the compares from a year ago? 
W. McMullen: I would certainly say a big piece of that is the compare to last year. Last year, in the third quarter, we had 5.4% ID sales. So when you look at the deflation we've had since then compared to that compare, it's really a little bit of a compounding effect as we begin the third quarter here. Keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter was 3.7% IDs, so the compare starts to moderate a little bit as well. And that just -- it's the range we feel that, at this point, where we think we would wind up in. 
Stephen Tanal: Great. And if I could just sneak one last one in. If you could comment on the health and wellness side. Obviously, with Axiom dead, it seems like you do have some interest in the pharmacy business. Any thoughts on that business, building it out maybe longer term? 
W. McMullen: Well, it's certainly -- when you look at the total health and wellness strategy, we are very excited about the opportunities there. Obviously, all of us baby boomers keep getting older and the new generations as well, and it creates higher demand for pharmaceuticals and other things. So it's an area that we like. It's an area where we believe we have a unique competitive advantage just because we can start helping customers eat healthier as well, and that's something that's a positive in terms of the overall connection with the customer. And when you look at all the pieces together, we think it's a great opportunity to create sum of all parts where a customer can engage with us in a physical facility, online or through the specialty drug channel and then we can leverage across and then the Little Clinic helps as well. So we really get excited about the opportunities. And the other thing that we really like is that customer is very loyal as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: A couple of quick clarification questions. The statement about quarter-to-date comps being at a lower end of the range, was that the annual range or the back half range? 
W. McMullen: It's the back half range. And remember Mike's comment about as you go to this -- first of all, we're cycling incredibly strong identicals a year ago, and then as you get to the fourth quarter, you start cycling identicals that were lower than where they were in the third quarter. I don't know, Mike, anything you're going to add? 
J. Schlotman: I would agree with that. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. And my other clarification, there were a few deflation numbers that were mentioned this morning. I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page with those. I think what you said, and correct me if I'm wrong, total company deflation was minus 1%. Total deflation x pharma was minus about 1.25% and perishable deflation was minus 1.5%. Do I have those right? 
J. Schlotman: So yes, a little less than 1%, including pharmacy; 1.25%, excluding pharmacy; and grocery was about 1.5% negative. 
W. McMullen: And that's grocery only. That's the way we define grocery. 
J. Schlotman: Which includes the dairy complex. Not everybody has the dairy complex in grocery, but we do. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. I had heard that can be perishables. I think it was grocery. One quick one here. Sprouts said this week, and if you addressed this, forgive me, but most of the more extreme pricing actions they're seeing in the marketplace were promo driven, not really list price reductions. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that one of the reasons you have hope that maybe some of the irrationality you're seeing out there will be short lived? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we see a little bit of everything out there. And as Rodney said a few minutes ago, our -- over the breadth of the geographies we have, you see a variety of everything. You see people in certain -- even if they're a broad-based retailer, you see them doing things in one geography and not other geographies, and then you see regionals doing particular things in and out of different promotions and then other people continuing to make investments in price. And we did a little bit of all those as well. We put out a circular, sometimes weekly, sometimes for a couple of weeks, and we continue to invest in everyday price as well, so it's really no different. I think the thing to keep in mind is, we don't always necessarily just react to what particular competitors are doing with our relationship with 84.51°. We put significantly more science behind how and when we make price investments, whether it's promotional activity or a permanent price reduction. 
Operator: And next, we have Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Just going back to the comments from the macro perspective, first, on the consumer with the surveys. Wondering if you're seeing anything different kind of sequentially in terms of SNAP that's being used in the stores or in terms of the items in the basket. And then secondly, just on the competitive commentary that you gave, understand that varies by geography. But just wondering just kind of if -- overall, are you seeing some of the heavier pockets of competition coming from particular segments of the market, whether that be more of the larger conventionals, the big boxes or some of the smaller regionals discount, that type of thing? 
W. McMullen: When you look at the surveys overall, first of all, SNAP continues to decline and it has for the last -- I'm going off of memory, and then Mike, if you remember the exact number, but I want to say like 1.5 years or so that it's been declining. 
J. Schlotman: That's about right. 
W. McMullen: Some of the decline is driven because of changes in terms of what is in SNAP in terms of programs that get renewed or don't get renewed. If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items in the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving. In terms of the competitors, I don't know that there's too much I can add from what I -- Mike and I mentioned before. Overall, I wouldn't say that we're seeing a huge difference. If you go back and look, you have competitors that had gone out of business that now stores have been reopened in some parts of the country. You have all kinds of different things going on. And to make a blanket statement or -- a blanket statement toward a specific competitor, that, I don't think it would be helpful because I really don't see it changing massively when you look at big groups. I don't know, Mike, anything you would want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I would agree with you. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. No, that's helpful. And if I could slide one more fast one in here. Just with the kind of the next 2 years or so of annual CapEx kind of getting back to that sub $400 million mark, just any other color that you can give us all in terms of where versus what you have been planning when it was over the $400 million range, kind of where some differences may lie? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we've obviously done a lot of work at this point in the year to pare back capital spending in the current fiscal year because you have projects in the pipeline. There are certain projects that will slide into the next fiscal year and then projects from '17 that will slide into '18 probably. And I'll remind you that our -- a few of the $500 million reduction is for this year and next year -- well, [ph] for this year and then keeping the next year in the same range as this year. We just think it's prudent in this environment to maintain and increase our financial flexibility to respond to the environment that's out there and to have that incremental cash to be able to spend. Our view is there will always be a significant number of projects in the pipeline, and we're comfortable we're going to be able to do the projects we have the highest level of confidence in and get those built while maintaining as much financial flexibility as we can. It's not concentrated in any one geography, particularly this year. Frankly, some of it was where did we have stores we're not legally committed to open or start projects on, and we feel very good about -- that level of spending will still be a record year for spending. So it's not -- and it's a very substantial investment in the business. 
W. McMullen: The biggest effect will probably be in terms of net new stores. If you just make blanket statements in terms of where will it -- but it'll be a little of everything, but that's probably the biggest bucket. 
J. Schlotman: I would agree with that. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So I'm kind of just sitting back and listening to the call and trying to compared it to what we're seeing out in the marketplace and there's definitely just a little bit of a disconnect. I mean, you have your biggest competitor, Walmart, that's on the record. They were just at the Goldman Sachs conference, and I'm sure you guys see the research. I mean, they're clearly moving on price in certain geographies and have said that they are going to continue to do that. And we can also see the market share moving pretty quickly towards them. Then we saw Albertsons, your second biggest competitor, lowering price pretty aggressively, not all geographies but in several of yours. But you guys say you don't see anything different. So I mean, are you hoping they just don't keep coming at you? I mean, we do see your comps now at about 0.5%, and it seems like the market share has -- your market share gains have ebbed. So I'm just trying to understand the strategy a little bit better. 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at our market -- we continue to gain market share in the second quarter. The -- if you look at it from a competitive standpoint, our second biggest competitor would actually be somebody other than Albertsons. I don't remember which -- where Albertsons is right now, but Costco would be the second-largest competitor. The -- I always think it's important to look across the whole country and what's going on, and I made the comment before about all short statement. All short statements in economics are wrong. And there, you can see behavior, all kinds of different behavior across the country, what competitors are going to do. Your guess is as good as ours would be in terms of whether that's something they're going to do everywhere or if that's something they're testing or -- and what speed does it take for them to do it everywhere. I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add? 
J. Schlotman: I agree. And just keep in mind, when you think about what competitors are doing, it's not like our prices have remained stable or increased. We continue to invest in price as well. 
Scott Mushkin: So I mean, I guess, last quarter, I asked Rodney that -- if Walmart did follow through, what would you do? Would you continue to keep your gap where it's gone, which is lower? It's been lower over the last several years, it's pretty narrow in the mid-single digits in a lot of markets, not every market. It seems like now, you're -- seem okay at least in certain markets with that gap to move up maybe back into the mid-teens, and I'm just again, I would push on why. 
W. McMullen: I would challenge your comment because first of all, we would not publicly say what we're going to do from a competitive standpoint in advance of doing it because I think the FTC would probably get a little upset with us along with, I know, our general counsel would be. And I did not say that we would be comfortable with any specific number, and you were the -- and you gave the specific numbers that you speculate what that is. I would go back to the comments that Mike and I made before. We continue to execute our strategy. There's parts of the strategy that's more important than just price. It really is everything all together. To say, to react to specific comments, I think, would be very difficult. And how you look at a basket of goods may be different than how a customer looks at a basket of goods as well. 
J. Schlotman: One of the other things that continues to fascinate me with all the conversation about investing in price or not investing in price, 18 months ago, all the questions I was getting is, why do you guys continue to invest in price, why don't you let your gross margins go up? You've closed the gap everywhere, now you can reap the benefits of what you've sown. And we've staunchly said for years we're going to continue to invest in price because if you look at any segment of retailing, over any period of time, gross margins always decline, and we'll continue to maintain our financial flexibility and execute our Customer 1st Strategy of investing not only in price, but the 3 other elements of it as well. 
Scott Mushkin: And then just one last quick one. Are you guys happy with where your market share gains are so far in the third quarter? And then I'll yield. 
W. McMullen: Well, the -- looking at market share gains, I don't think it's -- the data isn't quick enough to be able to answer where we are so far in the third quarter on market share gains. And I actually couldn't answer the question because we wouldn't have the data yet from the market. And we look at market share by looking at Nielsen data, IRI data and other sources. 
Operator: And the next question is from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: I apologize ahead of time. I'm going to ask for a couple of quick clarifications. I hope you answer them. On the deflation, can you give us some insight on -- I get the meat deflation and the commodity-driven deflation. But can you give us some insight -- as you roll from the first quarter and into the second quarter, did the deflation spread out significantly in the center of store? And are you seeing and expecting deflation in sort of the CPG-driven part of your business? That's one clarification I'm looking for. 
J. Schlotman: It certainly did pick up in the grocery category in the second quarter as far as more deflation. The other thing that's happened, and I said this actually earlier today when I was on CNBC, if you look at produce, it wasn't deflationary in the quarter, but it was -- there was disinflation in produce in the second quarter. So it was less inflationary in the second quarter than the first quarter, so we were -- it's fairly broad-based. 
W. McMullen: Yes, but if you look within grocery, it's heavily driven by the dairy category, which is obviously mostly milk. Eggs is a huge part of that. So if you look at the acceleration, it's really being driven by a few select items within it. 
J. Schlotman: Fair point. 
Robert Ohmes: And then my second clarification is if you look at the natural organic category within your store, whether it's looking at it at Simple Truth or looking at the natural organic brands that you've now been carrying for a while, is natural organic deflating right now? 
W. McMullen: It would only be in terms of the areas that are commodity driven. So if you look at eggs, eggs is kind of fascinating because there wasn't as much inflation a year ago in eggs that were organic eggs. So the deflation there isn't as much. It's because they didn't inflate as much. Milk would be a little bit. But if you look at the alternatives in terms of grain-based milks, really not so much there. I don't know, Mike, any... 
J. Schlotman: I agree with you. 
Robert Ohmes: That's great. And just last one, not a deflation question. Can you give us a sense of Simple Truth momentum in penetration and remind us where that's at? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we continue to be thrilled with Simple Truth. It continues to grow as a brand. More and more households continue to enter into the category and stay in the category. Our corporate brand folks continue to do a great job of expanding the category with incremental products in the category as well. It's really the cornerstone of our natural and organic program. 
W. McMullen: And it would continue to be growing at close to double digits, especially if you don't include chicken because there's quite a bit of deflation in chicken right now. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: Just in regards to your 8% to 11% long-term earnings guidance, would you expect a return to that range in 2017? And the follow-up to that is, what gives you comfort in that level of earnings growth, especially since many folks are worried that the promotional environment will intensify down the road? 
W. McMullen: I wouldn't feel comfortable telling you the specific time until we give 2017 guidance. So -- and I don't want to think we want to go ahead and give '17 guidance now. And we really look at it over a rolling 3-  to 5-year period of time. And if you look at it historically, we've actually grown in -- well in excess of the 11% over a 3-year period of time and a 5-year period of time, both on the quarter and the annual basis. So it really is -- when you look at the overall ability to connect with the customers, that's why we feel comfortable with that 8% to 11%. We still see tremendous opportunities to improve the way we connect with customers and the way we run our business. And you guys hear me say often that our to-do list remains bigger than our done list, and that certainly remains the case. And that's the reason why we remain confident in the 8% to 11% plus a dividend that's increasing over time, is that we still see plenty of opportunities to grow the business, connect with the customer in a deeper way and to continue to run our business better. And it's one of the things that's exciting every time you figure out something that you could do better and you do it, it helps you learn how to do something else better. So that's the reason why we get excited. At this point, I wouldn't feel comfortable to give you the specific period of time and obviously, at some point, we'll give some guidance on '17, but it's really too early at this point. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. Just a couple of quick clarifications as well. On the taxes, the employee share-based payment, is that a onetime thing? I mean, should we expect the 35% tax rate going forward into '17? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. It's purely driven by how many stock options wind up getting exercised in any time frame and a reclassification from an accounting standpoint where the benefit of that goes in the financial statements. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. And last one for me. Just you've given guidance on fuel gross margins in the past. I think you've previously said it would be at or below the 5-year average. Is that still your view for this year? 
J. Schlotman: Our view for the rest of the year is it will continue to -- on a rolling 4 quarters basis, it will continue to trend down from where we finish the quarter, and I wouldn't see that expectation any different. We had a very, very strong fuel quarter last year. It's actually held up better so far this year than we thought. We finished the rolling 4 quarters at the end of the second quarter at $0.184. That was down $0.002 from last year. We would expect that downward trend to continue a little. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Alvin. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.
 I want to thank the many associates sharing in the Kroger journey. We have 6 generations working with us today. Each associate makes a unique contribution. You bring your energy and ideas, your experiences and expertise. We are a better company because you've made Kroger the place where you want to be and work.
 Even as we've grown and gotten bigger as a company, I know that when the doors open and the lights go on at our stores, offices, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, everyone is giving their best to our customers, our company and each other. That means a lot and that will make all the difference.
 Thank you for everything that you do for our customers every day. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2016-06-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thanks, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.
 Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.
 We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.
 We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.
 Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.
 We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.
 Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.
 Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.
 Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.
 In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.
 There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51° on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. 
 Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.
 Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
 Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.
 Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years.
 During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.
 Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.
 We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.
 Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.
 Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.
 Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.
 For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.
 We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. 
 During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09x during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.
 Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.
 I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.
 For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.
 Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.
 We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.
 Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are proud of our team's performance during the quarter, especially in light of the challenging operating environment. We've been through business cycles like this before. The best thing we can do is to deliver on our promise while investing for the future. We will continue to execute our Customer 1st strategy, and by doing so, we'll create long-term value for our shareholders.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Can we maybe start off with just color on the cadence of the IDs through Q1, what you're seeing so far in Q2? And then, Rodney or Mike, could you maybe dissect sort of like tonnage trends versus inflation trends and then lastly, as part of all this, the impact that Roundy's had on the Q1 comp? 
W. McMullen: Okay. Ed, I'll start out and let Mike fill in. But if you look across the quarter, I would say it bounced around a bit. Part of that was driven by weather. Earlier in the quarter, we had basically no weather benefits this year versus a lot in the prior year. As you get toward the end of the quarter, Memorial Day moved from the first quarter to the second quarter, and early in the quarter, you had Super Bowl. So there's a lot of things going on. The other thing on inflation, inflation, we had expected that it would start picking up some, and when we look going forward, we just don't see that picking up. If you look at so far this quarter, we're inside the range, just slightly below the midpoint of the range of the 2.5% to 3.5%, but as you know, it's still very early in the quarter. Overall, the core continues to be strong, and we're cycling incredibly strong numbers from last year, and tonnage continues to be solid. I don't know, Mike, anything else you'd want to add or thoughts? 
J. Schlotman: No. One of the things we have done is if you look at our real growth, that's IDs minus the inflation number that we give,-- if you look at the 2-year stack of that, it's amazingly consistent quarter-to-quarter, less than a 50 basis point swing when you look at it over the last 5 or 6 quarters. So when you look at things over a little bit longer time frame and you take out the effects of inflation on the reported numbers, our results have actually been amazingly consistent. 
Edward Kelly: And, Mike, just the impact of Roundy's on that 2.4% you report this quarter? 
J. Schlotman: It's about 30 basis points. 
Operator: And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: I know it's still early with ClickList in some markets, but what have you seen thus far in terms of how that's changing consumer behavior? And is it yet a new customer acquisition vehicle? 
W. McMullen: The -- as you started out your question, it's obviously very early. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're now in 25 markets. What we're finding is almost anything you say would be correct. So there's some new customers, and we find in some situations, a customer will spend more with us. But as you know, we're so focused on what is it the customer wants and needs are, and what we have is some of our customers tell us they really appreciate it. And that's really why we're focused on it and continue to roll it out because some customers find it incredibly helpful. We definitely -- from everything that we see, we find it's an and, and not an or. And the ClickList customer continues to come into the store, and it really is just one more way of making their life a little bit easier. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then I guess just as a follow-up, do you see -- do you think there'll be -- there's any difference in how you run -- will run ClickList or customer behavior in a marketplace versus a traditional food retail store given size differences and so forth? 
W. McMullen: The -- we have it in both types of stores, and we really find the behavior isn't that much different, but we do not have the Marketplace product on the website. So somebody -- if somebody wants to buy something from the Marketplace side, they have to put it in the comment section, "Can you get me that?" and obviously, we will. But the -- we don't see differences in behavior between one type and other. One of the things that's always part of the consideration is do we have space to do it in a store, and that's driven as much the decision on a size of store. There's some Marketplace stores we don't have it in that we'd like to have it in because we just really don't have the space to do it. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: How much do you guys characterize the macro environment in the quarter? And any color you have on just the consumer side, I mean, overall? I think you guys mentioned that units per transaction were down slightly. Is there -- is that any kind of indication that the consumer might be a bit softer? Or any color there would be great. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the units per basket, they were down slightly, but that was overcome by more trips, making more trips to drive more units during the quarter. So the -- if you just looked at those 2 metrics, it would have been a slight increase in the tonnage, and then the new households pushed the tonnage to be nicely positive. I think Rodney touched the -- there's clearly a lot going on out there. The macro environment, there's the inflation, deflation. There's gas retails were rising during the quarter. There -- it was an interesting quarter, but there's so many unusual things out there. Our own comparisons to a lot -- like Rodney said, the Super Bowl this year, then the weather, then Memorial Day moving. As Rodney said, the cadence of ID sales was really a little bit all over the board depending on the week you're looking at. But our fundamental approach is focused on the customer, make sure we're delivering on the value propositions that they want. And -- but just based on how they're shopping with us, it sure seems like we're hitting the mark on that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And the economy yet to me, and Mike and I have talked about this, it's really hard to describe, and it's very mixed. And how much of that is driven because of the election and everything else, I'll let somebody that has better insights into that than us to try to speculate on that. The strength certainly doesn't feel as strong as the numbers suggest. But with that said, if you look at the things that would be discretionary items or more upscale items if you look at wine, Boar's Head, Murray's, Starbucks, all of those continue to grow very nicely from an identical standpoint and well outperform the total. So it's really pretty hard to describe from what we can see. 
Shane Higgins: Yes, appreciate the color. And just a quick follow-up. So it sounds like you guys are driving additional trips. Is that a function of consumers utilizing your fuel rewards? Is it more of a shift towards fresh and produce, more produce, more fresh? 
J. Schlotman: You do see those types of items in a lot of the baskets of the incremental trip. And as people strive to eat healthier and eat more fresh products rather than buying it and putting it in the refrigerator or freezer, it does appear as though they're making their trips to the grocery store a little more regularly and buying for a few days rather than for a week-long stock-up. That's certainly what it seems to be. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: First, I had a quick clarification to your answer to Ed on the quarter-to-date trends. I think you said you're slightly below the midpoint of the range. Is that correct? 
W. McMullen: Correct. 
Scott Mushkin: And then does that include or exclude the Memorial Day shift? 
W. McMullen: That would include the shift, the Memorial Day. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. That's perfect. So you're at the -- kind of a little below with the shift included. Okay. It's perfect. And then my big question. Obviously, you got a competitor, a large competitor making a lot of noise around price. So have you seen anything in the marketplace where they've gotten more competitive? And they have done and delivered what they said they were going to deliver as far as cleanliness and in stock. How seriously do you guys take their comments about several billion dollars of price investments, and they're even willing to take deflation in their own comps or kind of lower their own comps to get that done? And what's the plan at Kroger to kind of combat that if it ends up happening? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look, we take all competitors serious. So to say we only focus on one, we really do look at all competitors. And we think it's incredibly important to make sure we focus on what our customer needs are. And as you know, if you look on an annual basis, we've invested -- we are investing $3.6 billion in price today versus when we started on the journey. So we would have every intentions to continue to maintain our price position. But when you look at overall, the total customer, the way they look at value, it's much more than just price. And as you know, we stay focused on the total customer needs, and fresh products are incredibly important. What's the shopping experience? How long is the customer in line? How do they get treated by associates? All of those things are equally important, and we really are focused on continuing to improve all of those, and we've made substantial improvements in all of those. And the customer doesn't make a decision to shop-- where to shop based on only one dimension. And we think some of those other things create a very large competitive advantage for us. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. Great. And then I had one question. Obviously, the 10-year bond has been falling quite steadily here over the last 3 or 4 months, and that, obviously, has impacts on pensions. And just want to get your guys thoughts on this. We've seen the drop, what, like 50, 60, 70 basis points or something like that. And how should we think about pensions next year? Any framework there, Mike, on that? Do you think about this or no? 
J. Schlotman: Well, of course, I think about it. The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using  interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plan is a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because some day rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it. 
Scott Mushkin: And any idea kind of a rule of thumb what the expected rate of returns on these UFCW plans are? And then I'll yield. 
J. Schlotman: They're a little bit all over the board. I would say in the 7s is the most common, not a lot different than state -- all the state pension plans -- they're all -- they all do it the same way. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: Just on the topic of food inflation, deflation. This morning, the government data again showed the decline in food prices. So just want to get a sense of what your latest full year outlook is and how you're thinking about the cadence going forward. 
J. Schlotman: Well, as I said in prepared remarks, we would have expected to start seeing a little bit more inflation right now than when we were sitting here 3 or 4 months ago thinking about it, and it just hasn't happened. And as I sit here today, it certainly doesn't feel like we're going to have the pickup in overall food inflation. Milk would have been projected to start having some cost increases, but the federal market order on milk isn't showing any upward trend or not any significant upward trend. So I think we're going to wind up most of the year in a fairly low inflationary environment. 
W. McMullen: But as Mike mentioned before, tonnage continues to improve. We continue to improve market share. If you look at year-on-year, we continue to improve the connection with the customer, and our gross profit dollars and departments remain strong as well. So I think it's important to look at all those things together. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. Great. And then just going back to your commentary on traffic. If you look at traffic this past quarter versus recent quarters, has it improved? And if so, what's been some of the drivers do you believe behind the improvement? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we've continued to see strong growth in all households, including loyal and nonloyals. And I would go back to Rodney's prior comments on our unending -- the never-ending focus on the customer and making sure we understand what they want and figuring out a way to deliver that with them while still having the right value proposition for them and our shareholders. 
Operator: The next question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: On the food retail turning slightly deflationary, just to kind of echo Scott's question, is that being driven at all by competitors taking pricing down either more so than the deflation or just taking it down to try to get business going? Or is that all, as far as you can tell or mainly as far as you can tell, from the lower product costs? 
W. McMullen: If you look, almost all of it's in the fresh department. It's meat, seafood, deli. And all of those areas would be primarily driven by commodities. And then if you look in the grocery complex, milk would be a heavy deflation item, and that's, as Mike mentioned before, really driven by the federal market. So it's really -- it looks -- overall, it's more commodity-based versus competition-based. I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And on the guidance, keeping the ID sales the same as before but on lower inflation obviously means you think the -- you're going to see improvement in volume. So it sounds like volumes picked up a bit, but what's sort of driving that outlook? Is it some... 
J. Schlotman: It's our expectation for the year. If you look at the first quarter, we delivered the 2.4% in exactly that kind of an environment, and that was without the weather from the prior year and Memorial Day moving. So we continue to focus on driving units, driving tonnage and making sure that the customer's getting the well-rounded shopping experience that Rodney just spoke of. 
Andrew Wolf: And if I could just get in a follow-up on ClickList, kind of a generic question on profitability. Is the current model -- let's say a store produces a reasonable amount of volume in ClickList, is that going to be as profitable as having a customer come in the store and pick their own groceries? Or does the model really have to shift to something that's scaled up, where you can have kind of a dedicated pick facility? 
W. McMullen: When you're in the start-up period, obviously, it's a headwind. There, it's more expense versus the other way. We certainly see that if you look at a model, we feel very comfortable the model can scale out to where, from a profitability standpoint, the customer can do either one, and we're completely indifferent. One of the things that our team has done a lot of work on is trying to make sure we design a ClickList model that can scale to whatever the volume it scales to. So if it's 5% of the business, we'll do fine at 5%. If it becomes 20%, we'll do fine at 20%. And our team really has done a lot of work to try to make sure we design a model that can scale and scale from a profitability standpoint and the consumer will let us -- lead us to where -- what they -- what percentage they want it to be. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Is there any way that you can roughly quantify the benefit of the Memorial Day shift on 2Q today? Because you haven't really talked about that since 2004, and it's a long time ago. But from that, we estimate maybe a shift like that can help roughly about 100 basis points on a quarter-to-date number. So I'm just curious, is that roughly in the right range, meaning on a like-for-like basis, you're doing maybe a bit below 2% so far in the quarter, excluding the benefit from Memorial Day? 
W. McMullen: I don't know that we'll give you the exact number, but the 100 basis points isn't remotely correct. And don't forget you have the week after as well, and you really have to look at the 2 weeks together. 
Kenneth Goldman: Not remotely correct, meaning it's lower than 100 or higher? I'm hoping lower. 
W. McMullen: It's not even close to 100. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, you're not even in the right ballpark. 
Kenneth Goldman: Never been so happy to be wrong, but I appreciate it. 
J. Schlotman: I am as well. And if that's the impression that is out there, I've never been so happy to help you be wrong. 
Kenneth Goldman: Yes, that is the impression. So we'll be really smiling in the wrong house together. And then I want to follow up on EPS, and forgive me if this was asked, I didn't hear it. Coming in closer to the bottom or the midpoint of the range, but the reason that we cited was fuel, but you didn't -- unless I missed it, you didn't change your guidance for fuel margins coming in at or slightly below the 5-year average. That was the same verbiage you used last quarter. So I just wasn't quite sure what actually changed to cause you to reduce the outlook. 
J. Schlotman: Fuel continues to be very volatile, and it certainly -- again, sitting here in June trying to predict the rest of the year, and it certainly seems from what we see today that fuel will-- coming in at that or below it, we pumped a couple billion gallons of fuel in the first quarter, and a very smaller change in that retail cents per gallon adds up to a lot of money very quickly. So it's not like fuel has to change by $0.04 for it to affect our numbers in a big way. And it certainly seems that the trend would be closer to the below the 5-year average than at the 5-year average. But again, overall, it's really tough to predict. The last 4 days, oil has gone down. Is that going to lead to lower wholesale price of unleaded fuel? We'll know in the next few days. 
W. McMullen: Plus the first quarter was slightly better than where we expected it to be. 
J. Schlotman: Right, right. 
W. McMullen: But we only look at the year, we really don't see the change. 
Operator: The next question is from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. 
Zachary Fadem: Can we walk through some of the moving parts to the gross margin line in the quarter? With gross margin, ex fuel down slightly, can you talk about how things like deflation, price investments and the impact of Roundy's come into play here? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think I'll go down to that level of detail and walk through all the individual numbers. We continue to make the investments we plan to make in price throughout the first quarter. Certainly, the dynamics of deflation when you look at the whole gross profit margin for the entire company makes it kind of interesting because the -- as you have deflation, if you pass on exactly the lower cost to the customer, it drives your gross profit rate up. It's just simple math. Pharmacy continues to be a bit of a headwind to the gross profit numbers as well with some of the inflation in there and where the reimbursements rates are. So it's just a really big mixed bag. I would need several hours probably to explain it to you. 
Zachary Fadem: Okay. We'll take that one off-line then. 
W. McMullen: Sorry to interrupt, but when you look at it overall, it was pretty close to where we expected it to be. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I mean... 
W. McMullen: And we executed our plan, as Mike said. 
J. Schlotman: I absolutely agree with that. 
Zachary Fadem: Okay. Great. And just secondly, there's been a lot of talk about the online meal prep companies like Blue Apron. Have you considered expanding into this business? And if so, how are you thinking about it in terms of build versus buy? 
W. McMullen: I want to answer, but I don't want it to sound flip. The short answer is absolutely. And as you can imagine, we would look at any and all approaches. The thing that's important is if we find somebody to make an investment in that they would value the leverage that we bring to the party as well and assign some value to that. So it's not just something that has pure option value in the way they're getting valued. So the short answer is yes, we would be very open to doing it on our own or doing it with somebody. And I think if you look at our track record, we've had both approaches. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Wanted to dig in a little more on the Walmart question. We did a May price survey that was showing Walmart actually cutting in produce in 2 markets, cutting about 9% and 5% to 6% cutting in another market. Are you seeing that in your view of marketplace? And do you think it really matters relative to your offering in produce since you have a broader offering and a little more robust? 
W. McMullen: I don't know that I want to go in specifics because if you look at over the last, say, 2 years, you're going to find that type of variance among all retailers when you get down to a specific market, and it's really which market are you looking at. So I would hesitate to say there's something that's just fundamentally changing because you'll see those behaviors in specific markets all the time, because any of us, there may be some market that we're trying to cause something to happen. If you look -- as you know, for us, we've invested a ton of resources and labor improving the freshness of our products and especially in the produce department. And our customers are telling us we've -- we're making meaningful improvements in what they see from a freshness standpoint in produce, specifically. We're getting the same thing in other departments, but produce would be one as well. And for us, it's really important the progress we're making to continue to make improvements from that. And as you know, from an organic produce standpoint, we find that we have outstanding variety of organic, and customers continue to connect with that in a much deeper way. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, and inflation in produce in the first quarter was almost 400 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Still inflationary, but from fourth quarter to first quarter, it declined almost 400 basis points less inflation. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And, Mike, while we got you on, wanted to ask about the buyback. You did like $1 billion of buyback here in the quarter. Do you anticipate more throughout the rest of the year? Do you have any remaining in your buyback plan? And just give us an update on where you are there. 
J. Schlotman: I currently have exhausted the authority the board's given me. And if you look at our history, we don't like to be without authority for any particular point in time, and we have gotten the cadence over the last couple of years of front-end loading our buyback for the year. But we always want to have dry powder if the stock reacts in a way that we don't think is prudent based on our view of the underlying value of the company. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: I actually wanted to -- 2 questions. One, I wanted to see if I can dig a little bit more into the inflation or deflation versus your outlook. Mike or Rodney, is -- you guys have been talking about sort of good deflation versus demand-driven deflation. Are you -- I just want to clarify, are you starting to see some demand-driven deflation in your outlook that we should be concerned about? And maybe also, it was helpful that you comment on milk and perishables. What's the center-of-store inflation outlook for you guys now? Has that changed since you guys spoke to us last quarter? And then I have a follow-up. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I would say it hasn't really changed very much other than it looks like it's going to come slower, which could lead to less inflation for the full year by the time we get to the end of the year. And really, as Rodney said earlier, everything we're seeing is really price-led deflation, not demand-driven. We haven't -- I'm not sure, trying to understand the view of demand-driven deflation on the fly here because the number we're talking about is what we pay for a product versus what we paid for it last year. So I'm not sure that demand would have to change rather dramatically in the marketplace for it to affect our grocery category. But everything we're seeing is just a little bit less inflation than we expected right now, and it look likes that's going to persist. 
Robert Ohmes: And then just on Roundy's, have you given us or can you give us a sort of rough -- what do you think the rough impact on the FIFO operating margin is from Roundy's for this fiscal year? And just to clarify, is that -- does it look like the amount you're going to have to invest in Roundy's, including Mariano's, is that -- are you guys saying that's tracking right on plan? Or is that maybe going to be a little more than you initially thought? Any color on that would be great. 
W. McMullen: If you look overall, it's tracking on plan. I would say the thing that's taken a little longer than we would have expected is to get the actual thing started. So if you look at Wisconsin, obviously, I mentioned it in the prepared remarks. But on remodeling stores and making some of those changes, it took a little longer to get started than what we would have guessed. Now why we thought we could get it started so quickly, I'm not sure, and we'll learn that for the next time we do something, because we're still doing it faster than what we can do it within one of our historical Kroger divisions. The thing that I would say that I'm extremely pleased with is the -- our associates in -- at Roundy's and how welcoming they are and how excited they are to be part of Kroger and making sure that we leverage the size of Kroger, and the synergies continued to actually come in better than what we were expecting a little bit. But as you know, we'll continue to invest those synergies into driving our business. I don't know, Mike, you work on it closer than I do. 
J. Schlotman: No, I agree, and I do agree with Rodney's comment. I'm not sure why we were as bullish as we were being able to get remodel started because with an early termination of the HSR filing, the time from announcement to close was very quick, and then you had the holidays because we closed on December 18. And it just takes a while to get plans drawn, to get sign-off on how we're going to remodel the stores and things like that. But I can -- you can rest assured that if we found the right partner in Wisconsin to go to, you would see a lot of activity going on in and around a lot of the stores today. 
Robert Ohmes: And for Mariano's, are changes that you plan there either to assortment or anything else, is that maybe running a little bit slower than initially hoped for? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Mariano's, there really isn't much of a focus on assortment. There may be some products that the team in Chicago asked for -- we'll, obviously, give them access to it, and we'll start carrying it. But in Mariano's, the focus is continuing to build more stores. And I think this year, we'll end up opening 4 or 5 stores in Chicago on a base of 30-some stores. So very aggressive capital plan there. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: I'd like to take another crack at that question about the economy but not so much about how the U.S. economy is growing or slowing or whatever the case may be, but really looking at customer behavior as they look at some of these fresh departments and experience lower prices. What are you seeing between, say, types of protein? Are we seeing trading between those categories simply because people are more impressed with a lower price than they were last year? 
W. McMullen: There's no doubt that you see people, like in beef, buying more beef, things like that. So those things are definitely happening, but some of those prices are the best prices that customers would have seen in, I want to say, almost 3 years, just reflecting back. So how much of it is driven because of economy and how much of it is just driven because it is a great -- it's a good value again given the changes in price. I don't know, Mike, you were looking at details. 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree with what Rodney said. And if you look at the meat category in particular, until we got into late 2015, in 2014, you had -- in the early part of '14, you had mid- to high single digits inflation, ended 2014 with double-digit inflation. Last year started off high, and then as we got into the third and fourth quarter, the prices really started coming down. And it's people buying -- perhaps buying more and people coming back into the categories what's driving it there. 
Operator: The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of just the overall competitive promotional environment in both conventional as well as natural and organic, how is it today versus what you saw in the quarter versus the prior quarter. And more specifically, have you seen any impact from all this in California? 
J. Schlotman: Again, we won't go into specific competitors or geographies. But we always assume the environment around us is going to get more competitive when we build the business plan. If you happen to have a year where that's not the case, that just makes it -- the year a little bit better. But the industry's always been very competitive, and we see no -- nothing out there that would cause it to be less competitive. And we go into every year with that assumption and build a business plan of how we can invest the dollars we have to invest for our customers' benefit to drive more tonnage and more trips to the store and increase loyal households. And as we continue to do that, you see the results as the number of our loyal households continue to grow, their trips to the store continue to grow and then the units they buy on a monthly or quarterly basis continue to grow. And that really winds up being our focus. As Rodney said earlier on competition and pricing environment, we don't ignore anybody. We know what they're doing, but we always come back to what does our customers want and how can we satisfy that need. 
Alvin Concepcion: Got it. And just as my follow-up, wondering how we should think about the puts and takes to margins over the next few quarters. I know fuel margins are a big impact, but how much of an impact do you expect from things like the overtime legislation? And are you fully EMV compliant at this point? 
J. Schlotman: We are EMV compliant, where you have to be EMV compliant. The C stores and fuel pumps and things like that have a different deadline to be implemented. Some of our merged companies aren't completely there yet because they started later than we had started, and we're working to get them caught up. But if you look at the pre -- if you look at -- Roundy's has some work to do on EMV compliance, relatively small piece of the total pie. So those things won't affect us. What was the first part of your... 
W. McMullen: Yes, on the labor changes, we would not have very many management people that would be below the new minimum wage. We are going through and understand exactly how it will impact us, but a rough guess on an annualized basis, it's probably -- right now our guess would be $15 million to $20 million for the whole year. So it's -- in the overall scheme of things, it's not a lot, but we're still in the process of making sure what's the best approach for all our associates, but we don't have that many people that make less than that. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Wanted to circle back on Roundy's. It seems like their performance there was better than maybe your expectation, and just curious what drove that. Was that Wisconsin markets or Chicago? And do you think that 30 basis points -- are you looking for that 30 basis points drag for the next couple of quarters? Do you think that could continue to improve? Any color there? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I would think the 30 basis points is what it will wind up affecting the full year by. They continue to have -- obviously, with it being a headwind, their sales trends are below the rest of the company. It's not like flipping a switch and all of a sudden, you put a program in, and they're done. We're going about this in a very methodical way, for lack of a better word, of making sure the stores are cleaned up, making sure they're reset, making sure stores are remodeled that need to be remodeled. Some may wind up being relocated. And then you step back and you figure out how to get the best value proposition to their customers like we've done premerger with Roundy's. So the good news is this is a game plan that we've used before as we invested in growing -- taking a business who had sluggish sales in Kroger at the turn of the century to a company that has very robust sales. And it's a strategy we would expect to implement in Wisconsin as we go throughout the year. But it won't be flipping a switch where all of a sudden, they'll -- they'll turn on a dime. 
W. McMullen: And if you look at our overall Roundy's strategy when we announced the merger, we really look at it as a 3-year approach, and obviously, some of the things that we've talked about as part of it. But as Mike just mentioned, real estate would be part of that remodeling stores, expanding stores. All of those things would be part of the total package. One of the reasons why we get excited about Roundy's was obviously Mariano's, but in addition to that, in Wisconsin, the quality of the real estate, most of the real estate they have there is very good locations and for the most part, good store sizes as well. 
Kelly Bania: Okay. That's helpful. Then just wanted to ask, when you look at your households, you're increasing penetration with new households in particular. Wondering if you have any color on what kind of customer that you're getting there, that new customer. Is that a higher-income customer? A lower-income customer? Is it a diverse group? Any analysis that you've done around that would be helpful. 
W. McMullen: It's very diverse. And if you look, it would certainly be heavily weighted to the mainstream and then scale from that. So it's diverse from ethnic diversity. It's diverse from income diversity. It's diverse from age, which, for us, we obviously get excited by it being all of those groups. 
Kelly Bania: Great. And then one -- just last one on the fuel margins for Mike. Is it fair to say 1% -- a $0.01 swing in the gas margin could be around $0.05 to the EPS? Is that rough ballpark the way to think about it? 
J. Schlotman: I don't -- I actually don't have that calculation handy. 
W. McMullen: For the year, that would be fairly close. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. For a quarter it wouldn't, as Rodney said, for the year it would be fairly close. 
Kelly Bania: For the year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. 
Operator: The next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Mike, just a quick question on your view of the refinancing market right now. Looks like you had about $1.2 billion in CP, and you have $800 million maturing later this year. So just wanted to get your view on sort of continuing to use the CP market to roll some of your maturities versus terming them out in terms of the long-term market given where rates are. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we do have the $800 million later this year and $500 million -- a little over $500 million in January. What -- the reason -- I would see as debt matures, terming that out as it comes closer, we have been putting interest rate hedges on that debt throughout time to take some of the interest rate risk off of the table if rates got away from us quickly. Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term it out. If I have swaps or hedges or if I've done a 3- or 5-year floating rate note, you really can't change that quickly or eloquently, so that will be -- continue to be part of our strategy. 
Operator: And our final question will come from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research. 
Ajay Jain: Actually, most of my questions have been asked already. My question's on Roundy's. Obviously, it's early in your experience there, but since last year's fourth quarter was a step period and now you've got 1 full quarter under your belt, I'm just wondering if you've seen any change sequentially in Roundy's operating performance. So sequentially, are you seeing any change there that's meaningful? 
J. Schlotman: Again, it's in the ballpark of what we expected them to be. We have -- as Rodney said, if there's anything on Roundy's of note from us internally, it's that -- just that we had a little bit higher expectations of how quickly we could do some of the things that have taken a little bit longer than we expected, but we do have some momentum going now. 
Ajay Jain: Okay. And I think you mentioned and Rodney mentioned things took a little longer to get started in Milwaukee. But can you also maybe comment on how you view the challenges for Roundy's in Chicago compared to Milwaukee? Obviously, they're very different formats and different customer demographics. But to the extent that there's any real variability in terms of how those markets are performing, can you speak to that at all? 
W. McMullen: In Chicago, it's completely different. Obviously, this condition of the store base is substantially very, very good. Most of the stores -- the first store was opened in 2010. They had acquired a bunch of stores from Dominick's when Dominick's left the market. They're in the process of remodeling those stores. But the rest of the stores are in very good condition. The biggest thing in Chicago is just cycling a lot of sister store impacts because there were so many incremental new stores because of the Dominick's acquisition. But it's really -- the focus there is to continue to execute the plan, continue to connect deeper with customers and grow our market share. And Chicago is a fantastic market that we really like.
 Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. And as you know, I always like to tell our associates a few comments because we just have so many that listen in. And first, I want to take this -- take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the recent horrific attack in Orlando. What happened is tragic and heartbreaking. I also want to thank the first responders who put their lives in danger every day to protect us. I know our family of associates, those at Axiom Health Care outside of Orlando, across Florida and throughout the rest of the country is deeply saddened by what has happened. We stand in support of the LGBT community. An event like this affects each and every one of us. No matter where we live or work, it serves to remind us of what is most important, and that is taking care of each other. I want to thank our associates everywhere who demonstrate our values of diversity, inclusion and respect every day, to treat all with dignity, to seek and embrace the differences among people and to lift each other up. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us, and have a good summer. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2016-03-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. 
 Please go ahead. 
Kate Ward: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Kate, and welcome to Investor Relations. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel. 
 Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. 
 I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. 
 We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, "pick up at the store" service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.
 We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main & Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.
 2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and Pharmacy. 
 Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.
 Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.
 Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.
 That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.
 2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, wow, what a year. We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just one market down. 
 We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.
 There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter, and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to retreat or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. 
 Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Co. Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.
 There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims. That occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.
 In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. 
 Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. 
 Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. 
 I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend which is expected to increase over time. 
 In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter, we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. 
 We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. 
 We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. 
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. 2015 was an outstanding year. We delivered on our performance targets, grew market share, created 9,000 new jobs and even more opportunities for our associates, and we continue to expand the use of our technology to drive growth. We look forward to continuing that momentum in 2016. Obviously, lower inflation will be a headwind to sales, but when you look at -- back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we consistently do our job to manage through it and maintain relative pricing. In doing so, we'll continue to deliver greater value for our customers and for our shareholders. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So I just want to dive into the kind of the near-term outlook. And Mike, I think you said the tonnage was just fantastic during the quarter and actually better than last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, did you see tonnage slow? And then as you look at the cadence in the quarter, it does seem like things fell off a little bit as we got to the last 4 weeks of the quarter. And any thoughts there on kind of what the current environment is? I mean, there's a lot of nervousness out there that the deflation is really starting to bite and maybe the consumer and the volumes aren't quite as good. 
J. Schlotman: Our volume continues to hold up very well, Scott. When you look at -- even coming into this year, when you look at shipments, case shipments, out of our warehouses to replenish our stores, it remains very, very strong. When -- if you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of our product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of a department, like meat with the deflation, certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay, that's perfect. And so you didn't really notice any material change. But you did come in a little bit below your guidance, I think, on the comp. And I guess, what -- in your mind, what changed a little bit there? Or maybe nothing did. It just was a little bit more severe than anticipated? 
J. Schlotman: I think the biggest change was that we had almost no weather at all in the quarter. Inflation ended up being a little bit lower than what we expected, but I think that by far, the biggest part would be the weather. And basically, we had no benefit of weather in the fourth quarter, and most of that would have obviously shown up in -- later in the quarter. 
Scott Mushkin: So then, Rodney, this is then I'll yield as one kind of just more longer-term type of question. I mean, the industry fundamentals just generally, things seem to be changing rapidly. I know you guys expanded your ClickList, but you have a lot of, like, I call them, alternate business models kind of springing up, whether it's Green Bean in the Midwest, which is delivering to the home, or something like a Blue Apron. Obviously, the idea of click-and-collect or AmazonFresh delivering. Where do you see the industry going? And how do you see Kroger navigating that more long term? And then I'll yield. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Scott. When you look at long-term, and if you look at several of the changes we've made over the last couple of years, it is really merging with people that have expertise in some of those areas so that we could bring that within Kroger. And what we're really working hard on, and I mentioned it in my comments, is trying to create it where it's a seamless experience for our customer. By no means do I think we've arrived, but what we're finding is some customers like to engage with us multiple ways, and we're really striving to make sure that we have a model where we can let the customer decide how they want to engage with us versus us deciding that. So it's an exciting time to be in the industry. There's no doubt there's a lot of change going on. And the changes that we've been making over the last couple of years, we feel really good about positioning us to address where the customer is headed versus where they've been. 
Operator: The next question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
 Apologies. We have a question from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse instead. 
Edward Kelly: So a question for you. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question on inflation. I guess, Mike, first of all, do you have the inflation number for this quarter? I don't know if you gave that or not. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Just give me one second or whatever. It's about 60 basis points overall, but there's a lot of variability in that number. As I said in my prepared comments, the meat department was deflationary, deli was deflationary, seafood was deflationary, grocery was a little bit inflationary. So it's a mixed bag overall. And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And in the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year. And at the fourth quarter, at just under 5% inflation, and it started the year at 10%. So it's a wide range of things that have happened throughout the year on the inflationary front. 
Edward Kelly: The question I really wanted to ask about this is if I look into your guidance for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% IDs. Inflation, I think, in the 8-K you said, up 1% to 2%, which is not that different, I guess, than what 2015 is going to average out at. And you do have some difficult tonnage comparisons. You had such a great year in '15. So I guess, as we try to dissect this, is the difficult comparison in tonnage also playing a role in terms of how you're thinking about '16? And maybe as part of all that, you can sort of help us maybe understand why tonnage accelerated the way that it did last year? 
W. McMullen: Well, a couple of things. First of all, remember when we merge with somebody, we immediately include that company in our identicals. And I know there's other companies out there that don't include merged companies for the first year. And when you look at that effect, that will change the guidance by about 40 basis -- 40 to 50 basis points on identicals in terms of what our expectations are. The other thing is, and that's -- and you never know until after the fact is, how does the inflation happen. And we believe that early in the year, we won't see much inflation. We believe later in the year, we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year. And the inflation guidance is as much affecting the LIFO estimate as it is what we really think inflation's going to be if you volume-weighted it throughout the year. There's no doubt that when you cycle good numbers, the cycling is a little bit tougher. But it would be more driven by the inflation that we expect during the year and the mergers. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree with you. And you go back into some of the fresh departments, like produce. Produce inflation of almost 6% in the fourth quarter is not a good thing. That means there was probably a short supply of product and the product that was there was not that high of quality. So you really -- you can't just -- one of the things we've been trying to encourage people to do is, don't look at my 60 basis points of inflation. Try to dig down on the different components of it to understand how that can affect our business. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And let me just squeeze in one more, because I think it's an important one, and this is for you, Rodney. Could you maybe talk about how your M&A strategy is evolving? If I think about -- your company over the last few years, obviously you've been more aggressive than you were prior. You did Roundy's, which I think is something that years ago, at least from a Street perspective, we would have thought was something that maybe you wouldn't want to do, a turnaround into new market. But maybe just talk a little bit about how things are evolving and going forward, really sort of what you're looking for as opportunity? 
W. McMullen: It's really wouldn't -- if you think about the comments that we make on merger opportunities over the last 5 or 10 years, everybody should assume that we look at most opportunities, especially if it's in the U.S. We're really looking for companies that bring something to us that we don't have today. One of the things that we loved about merging with Roundy's was, as you -- as everybody knows, that we were looking at going into a new market. By merging with Roundy's, it allowed us to go into Chicago with a business that -- Mariano's had done a phenomenal job -- has done a phenomenal job on connecting with customers, and their market share is in the low teens. And they entered that market in 2010. So we felt like we could learn a lot, plus we started out a position of strength because of the success they've had. When you look at Wisconsin, Pick 'n Save and Copps has great market share across the state. We love Wisconsin. We -- it's a market that we really like, and we look forward to operating in it. So it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we've merged it with somebody. But I wouldn't -- I don't think you should read into that, that our strategies have just fundamentally changed in terms of the way we approach things. 
J. Schlotman: The other thing about Roundy's, particularly in Wisconsin, as Rodney said, not only did they have the very strong market share even though it's declined, the real estate sites they have were phenomenal. And we probably would not have considered a transaction like this if they didn't have outstanding real estate sites where we know we can grow their market share back to where it once was. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And that's a good point, Mike. There is no doubt if we didn't feel great about the real estate, we would not have embarked on merging with Roundy's. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: CapEx for '16 seems way higher than I would have expected. Can you give any color there? And I guess I was also wondering if you can give some puts and takes on how Roundy's might impact your comps for '16 in terms of guidance? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, relative to the CapEx, as you know, we talked about our fill-in market strategy back in October of 2012, and we had expected a steady step-up in the CapEx. The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market in the Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that, given their financial position, they couldn't have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategies as we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition. And the other thing that's in there for Roundy's is probably a little bit of capital for conversions and the like on systems and so forth. 
W. McMullen: And on the identical piece, I mentioned that mergers in total, if you look at our guidance we gave, you should assume about 40 to 50 basis points is the impact from the mergers that we've done. 
Karen Short: And sorry, what -- last follow-up. In terms of CapEx, is $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion the new base that we should use and kind of grow a couple of hundred million off of that every year going forward? And then can you just give some update on what the Pharmacy impact is on the comps in '16? 
J. Schlotman: As far as the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, we will continue to increase our CapEx, and execute our fill-in strategy so long as we're seeing the performance on the stores we're opening achieve the budgeted expectation so that they become the fuel for the engine. And from a granular standpoint, I don't think I'll get into department-by-department expectations for ID sales. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the experiments and formats that you're doing. I mean, obviously, you're looking at how to connect more broadly digitally with your customers. But I think, and maybe I missed a little bit of what you were saying, Rodney, but that they're Main & Vine. Maybe just talk a little bit about what the goal is with that test and where you think that can go? 
W. McMullen: The -- we think it's always important to be trying different approaches to connecting with customers. As you know, we've had phenomenal success in natural and organic over the last several years, and we really see customers continuing to see that as important. But with that said, there are certain items where the customer still wants to buy every day stuff. And when you look at Main & Vine, what we're trying to do is to merge those 2 pieces but connect at a local level a little deeper than we normally would. 
Meredith Adler: And that would be a smaller store of 35,000, 40,000 square feet as opposed to what you build for most new Kroger's? 
W. McMullen: Yes, the store would be probably more likely in the 22,000 to 30,000 square-foot type store. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. And then just at the other end, and I'm assuming that Main & Vine is not aimed at the lowest income customer, I know you've been testing Ruler, what are your thoughts about that format or whatever you need to do to extend the test? All these going to be expanding, I'm not sure how significant it will be, but customer feedback is actually surprisingly good about all these. So maybe you could just talk about your dealing with that lower-end customer. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at Main & Vine and Ruler, they are definitely targeted to a different customer. So I would agree with your comment completely. On Ruler, we're still trying to understand the economics of the model to get to where it actually performs at an ROIC that we're happy with. We continue to make progress, but we do not think we'd figured it out. We have a tremendous amount of respect for all the Lidl as well. We've spent as much time in Lidl stores as we have Ruler -- or as all these stores over the years. And Lidl has done a great job when you look at a lot of the European countries. So we have a lot of respect for those formats. There are certain customers that we believe likes to shop in that environment. Everything we can tell, it's not all customers. This is a customer segment, and what we're trying to do is to serve that segment. And if you look at Main & Vine, it's the same thing. There's a customer segment that we don't think anybody out there is really serving. And we're trying to identify a model that will serve that customer. 
Meredith Adler: And I guess my follow-up question on Main & Vine. Is that -- do those stores need to be located where the customer is low or middle income? Or is it more that it's near a fair amount of population that isn't very affluent? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at Main & Vine, it's very, very early, and we only have one store and it's only been open a few weeks. From a customer demographics, we would be looking more at a customer that would be overly influenced on speed and convenience for dinner and a little bit more bent for natural and organic. So that would be the customer that we will be looking for, and it would be driven by -- more by that than economics. 
 Thanks, Meredith. And I know -- I think this is your last call. Really appreciate you following us over the years, and best wishes on the beautiful retirement. And thank you for the partnership with Kroger, and thank you for the friendship. 
J. Schlotman: Take care, Meredith. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: I'm going to cheat and sneak in 2 quick ones. Just another one on inflation. You guys commented on the protein deflation and then produce being inflationary this quarter. Can you give us any color on just what's playing out in center of store overall from an inflation or deflationary standpoint? Any kind of thoughts looking into -- through 2016 here? And maybe tied into that, just competition, any update there? Walmart has been making efforts in produce in the supercenters. Neighborhood Market actually had a very good comp still in the most recent quarter. Just anything competitively, maybe even specifically, versus Walmart you can comment on? 
J. Schlotman: When you look at the grocery category from an inflation or deflation standpoint in the fourth quarter, it was slightly inflationary. I would remind you that, for us, we categorize milk and the dairy case overall in the grocery category. If you were to take the effect of lower cost and lower retails of milk out, the grocery department would have been closer to 1% inflation. And relative to the competitive environment, we pay attention to every competitor and what they're doing. As Rodney said, we get into a lot of our competitor's stores. I think a lot of this when we travel around, whether it's domestically or internationally, we probably often get into as many or more competitor stores as our own stores to keep an eye on what everybody else is trying to do. But what we really wake up every day trying to do is to make sure we're focused on our customers and understand what our customers want and try to deliver more on that every day. Certainly, in the background is what the competitive landscape is, but with knowledge and understanding we have of what drives our customers, that is our primary focus. 
W. McMullen: And one other thing I would just add, and this is a Kroger comment, yes, we've invested a lot in our Fresh departments, especially this year, and we've invested a lot in labor to improve the experience for our customers. I know our customers are giving us good feedback on what we've done. I think every competitor is really working hard to get better, and the customer's telling us, the changes we're making, they like what we do. 
Robert Ohmes: And just on the grocery inflation ex milk, anything we should think about for 2016 that would make it different than what you guys saw in 2015? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I guess I would answer that as, who knows? I mean, you could have a weather disruption or any number of items that happened during the year. You could have a bumper crop of corn and wheat or a horrible crop of corn and wheat that changes the dynamics of not only the Fresh departments but the Grocery categories. I think we've -- when you look at our own ability or inability to predict where LIFO may wind up, when you're really predicting inflation on one day at the end of the year, the amount of units you'll have, it's just so volatile. Our job is we try to understand what's going on, on a regular basis and make sure we're delivering on our customers' wants and needs. 
Operator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So first one is -- Mike, I know you'd talked a lot about and you gave us color on some of the expense pressures that you saw during Q4 and, it sounds like a lot or many of them could be transitory. Just want to get a sense of what type of expense pressures do you expect in 2016 on your business? 
J. Schlotman: Well, there's always expense pressures out there. And as I said in the prepared comments, there were some that we would expect to be -- to mitigate and go away over time, most likely by the end of the first quarter, things like the chargebacks from the EMV conversion. We can and will need to do a better job on shrink control. We know that opportunity is out there, and it's staring us in the face. We have some processes and tools that we're testing today that -- to make us more successful in that category. We also understand that, as I said in our labor negotiations, pension and health care costs, there are some that we face that some of our non-union competitors don't face the same extent, and we have to make sure that's front and center as we negotiate the list of contracts I spoke of that are up this year. 
W. McMullen: And when you look at the year overall, we would expect to be able to continue to manage for our costs are going down. And we have a ton of process changes that we're working on to take cost out of the business. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I actually agree, Rodney. Our goal is year-over-year to be able to continue to reduce our total operating costs. 
W. McMullen: As a percent of sales. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
W. McMullen: Without fuel. 
Rupesh Parikh: Great. And my follow-up question, is it possible to get the quarter-to-date trends? 
W. McMullen: If you look at quarter-to-date on identicals, it would be a little bit below the bottom of the range. That's consistent with where we thought we would be at this point. The weather -- the cycling of weather continues to be -- because we just basically had no weather benefits, but if you look at where we are, it's consistent with where we thought we would be so far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So just curious if you guys can talk to the impact of the capital program. I guess specifically this year on the P&L, and then also cash flow. Meaning, will the -- with all of the incremental footage, does that weigh on EBIT -- ex fuel EBIT margin a bit? Is this the peak year for that? And then how does this impact utilization of free cash, particularly how you think about buyback? 
J. Schlotman: I think the -- I don't think this will be the peak year, but it'll be getting close to the peak year. We're going to -- when you talk about 100 major store projects for us, we haven't done that many major projects in quite a while. They will be -- they are typically a drag for a while before they start generating positive EBITDA. So I don't think we're there yet. It's certainly -- when we build our model, we certainly contemplate the effect of our capital program as well as making sure that we continue to get the contribution from those stores that are 1 year or 2 old today that should be throwing off some significant EBITDA to help us manage through the process. 
W. McMullen: And -- yes, but it would be very close. 
John Heinbockel: And how about the cash flow impact? 
J. Schlotman: Say that again? 
W. McMullen: Cash flow. 
John Heinbockel: Just the cash flow impact. 
J. Schlotman: I think if you look at our free cash flow generation over the last several years, I think we're in a good spot relative to being able to continue to execute with -- the expanded CapEx, a strong dividend, and we expect it to grow over time as well as executing a buyback strategy. We would expect to do all 3 of those. 
W. McMullen: When you look at it on a cash flow, we've also made great progress on improving working capital, which is funding part of it as well. 
John Heinbockel: And then maybe for you, Rodney, more strategically, when you think about the nonfood side of the marketplace, how do you -- how would you -- how do think that will evolve? How would you like that to evolve? And is it possible you can get broad distribution of more brands that maybe you haven't been able to get to date? 
W. McMullen: Well, we would certainly expect, over time, that there would be more of the brands -- bigger brands, would sell to us when those companies understand that we're going to treat their brand and respect their brand and support it just like they do. And we partner with a ton of great branded companies out there. And what we believe we can do over time is to show them that we're going to take care and grow and support their brand just like they do. 
 If you look at the nonfood side of the marketplace store, we think it will continue to evolve over time. So it's one of those things where what we do today is different than what we did 2 years ago. What customers tell us is they like what we do today better than we did 2 years ago. But we still think there's still -- it will never stop evolving. But as you know, when you look at the grocery side, it doesn't stop evolving either. And customers give us good feedback on that side of the store because it's things they pick up because they find a great value for what they find, that's something at a very reasonable price. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: I wanted to ask a bit further on Roundy's. Can you guys just give us a little bit more color in terms of, now you're a month and a half or so in, what have you found to be kind of, let's take the main conventional banners for a second in terms of the amount of work that needs to be done. Is it more kind of assortment? What percentage may need more kind of true remodels or anything like that? And then maybe on Mariano's, anything worth noting that needs to be done versus maybe just looking towards future expansion? 
W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at Mariano's, that brand is incredibly strong and it's really supporting the brands that's been built and continuing to build out that. When you look at Wisconsin, it really reminds me of where Kroger was several years ago, and it's really embarking on the same journey that we've been on over the last several years in terms of all the items that you talked about. The 2 things -- I guess, 3 things: One, there's a lot of learnings that we can bring back into Kroger from Mariano's. If you look at some of the things that we're really working hard with Roundy's in total, it's bringing the synergies of $110 billion company to procurement and using 84.51° to help with insights there that we've obviously had a long successful journey on. I don't know, Mike, anything else you would want to add? 
J. Schlotman: No. I mean, we spent a lot of time in the Wisconsin market before we decided to go ahead with the merger. I don't think -- there's probably not a store in Wisconsin that some member of our senior management team hasn't been in and many of the stores we would have been in multiple times all over the state. We understood -- we had a good understanding of what investments we're going to need to make in infrastructure, what improvements we may need to make from potential resets or incremental hours in stores to better serve customers. So we factored in the things that before we could actually sit down and -- across the table of what we thought we needed to do to bring them back to the market share they once had. 
W. McMullen: We really feel good about the people. And as you know, Roundy's was -- had a tremendous amount of debt, which really didn't give them the financial flexibility to do some of the things they would've liked to have done. And we really -- the associates on Roundy's, they care so much about the customers. The senior leadership really does want to support the stores on improving the experience for customers. So that's one area where I thought we would feel good about, but I actually feel even better than what we thought going in. 
Vincent Sinisi: That is helpful. And maybe just one more quick one here. Just going back to Main & Vine, and appreciate the color with Meredith's question there. But just to kind of help us picture until the folks on this phone can get into the store itself. But I know it's early, but can you just give us a little bit more sense for, is there going to be a lot of Simple Truth, private label offering, kind of maybe a little bit more around the initial mix that you're testing at this point? Or -- and anything else that would be helpful? 
W. McMullen: Well, probably the biggest thing that would be easy is if you look at the Fresh departments, the amount of space dedicated to Fresh departments would be very high. The other thing that we would do is really try to make sure we're doing all we can to support local food suppliers. So local coffee, local cheeses, local bakery, those items. 
 If you look at the grocery side, that would really be -- there would be Simple Truth in the store, but there would also be a lot of natural and organic. I don't -- and I guess, the other departments that would be a little bit expanded would be on the health and wellness and cosmetics and some of those things and even supporting the local community. 
 Mike just made another point to me that we used our 84.51° insights to what to carry in the store and how to set the store. So -- and it's a store where we've completely used the data to determine that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I was a bit surprised to hear that the quarter-to-date ID number was light or lighter than, I think, some people hope for because I would've thought that the Super Bowl shift would have helped a bit. And I would've thought, just based on your guidance, for 1Q to be better, that maybe the top line would've been better there. So maybe those things are true, but just the lack of favorable weather was bigger than we thought. I'm just trying to get some sense of the sizing of the impact of, I guess, football and weather on the quarter and also sort of an explanation, and maybe I just missed it, of the -- how the comp sales are going to be lower but the EPS are going to be higher at the ends of your ranges? 
J. Schlotman: When you look at the quarter to date, it is -- Super Bowl selling was great. But almost every week or, really, every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter, when we weren't up against weather, when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased, and units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into the new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on IDs not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were -- that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind to reported ID sales -- absolutely. But overall, the generation of profitability in milk was strong for the year. 
W. McMullen: Yes. And remember, the other comment I made earlier is we would expect inflation to be lower in the early part of the year and higher at later part of the year. But when you look at inflation overall, we've operated our business in low inflation and high inflation, and we've been successful in both environments. 
Kenneth Goldman: And then my follow-up, on M&A, I think you said that -- and you've said this previously, you're always looking for something, whether it's capabilities or a geography that you don't have today, I think one of the concerns out there is that Kroger may be more amenable to deals that would be considered, I guess, surprising to The Street than they used to be. Because looking for something you don't have today kind of leaves you open to almost anything. You can go into a new format, a new country. So I'm just curious for investors out there listening, are there limitations to what you'd buy even if it's something that you would consider new in terms of what you don't have now? 
W. McMullen: Yes, the -- I'll go back to what I said before. You shouldn't expect the way we would look at merging any different today than over the last several years. And as you mentioned in your comments, you should assume that we would look at most things; and I add a second ago in the U.S. So you shouldn't think that all of a sudden, you're going to see us in some place that we have no knowledge or no synergies. On the capability, I mean, we're really looking at things that are in our core business. So I mean, we're in the food business and we're in the health and wellness business. So I mean, those are the areas where we're going to be focused on; how do we get a deeper and better connection with our customers. So you shouldn't assume something that's out in left field. 
Operator: Next question comes from Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo. 
Zachary Fadem: Just to stick with Roundy's for a minute. How are you thinking about the timeline of just integration and investments throughout fiscal '16? And have you started to roll out things like price investments and store improvements yet? And given the volatile deflationary environment, have you considered delaying price investments in certain categories? 
J. Schlotman: We have a timeline developed for how we're going to work with the Roundy's team, particularly in Wisconsin. I'm not going to get into what that timeline is. But you should assume it's not just a 2016 effort. It would be very similar to how we've done overall investments at Kroger. And it will be multifaceted over a number of -- over a fairly long-time horizon. I don't think there's anything in our minds that would cause us to delay what we think we need to do at Roundy's because of the current operating environment. We're -- as Rodney said, we're as bullish as we were 6 months ago when we were looking at this. It's only been 2 months. The deal closed December 18, so it's only been, okay, 2.5 months. You certainly didn't disrupt our team or their team during the holiday selling season. So it was really after the first of the year where we first started sitting down one-on-one with them and developing plans and strategies. And we feel very good about what our plans are going forward. 
W. McMullen: We've done a ton of work on research and working with the Roundy's team to try to understand the customer and understand the customer wants and needs. And the plan will actually be starting to execute against our understanding of the customer wants and needs. And some of it will be test and some of it will be to go do it. 
Zachary Fadem: Great. And just as a follow-up. Big picture, you've implemented a ton of productivity initiatives over the years in your stores, shorter checkouts, labor efficiencies. I'm curious where you think there's additional room for improvement in your stores. You mentioned shrink as one of them. Is there anything new planned for fiscal '16 to drive better efficiency, particularly with so many remodels and expansion projects planned? 
W. McMullen: The short answer is yes, and I'm trying to figure out a way to give -- help you give insight without giving away something that our competitors wouldn't know about. There are several projects that we have underway. Technology and process change would be a big part of those. And if you look at the things for '16, there would be an executed [indiscernible], and we're actually starting to work on some of the things that we'll do in '17 as well. 
Operator: That final question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just wanted to go back to the guidance and the inflation outlook for a second. If I'm hearing you correctly, so the ID guidance 2.5% to 3.5% includes the 40 to 50 basis points drag from Roundy's. So if you take that out, you're kind of in that 3% to 4% range, which is just what you guided to last year, and also you'd also guided to a 1% to 2% inflation outlook last year. So am I right to think that it's really the same but that maybe the products within the categories are a little bit different and the pace may be accelerating throughout the year instead of decelerating throughout the year? Or what's really different, I guess? 
J. Schlotman: You did a better job of explaining what we were saying. The -- really, that's what we would think is early in the year, we're cycling a little the inflation higher last year, lower this year. We would expect as we get later in the year that we would be a little higher inflation, if you think about the dairy comment that Mike made. We'll soon start cycling lower dairy prices and some of those things. So your comment is absolutely correct on all those pieces. 
Kelly Bania: And then what's -- just in terms of the drag from Roundy's this year, is that something that we should think about for maybe a couple of years? Or what's a reasonable timeframe to expect that to maybe not get in line with the rest of the base but to be less of a drag? 
W. McMullen: The -- if you just look at our own models, we would think it would take 2 to 3 years to where it -- before it would get to where it would look more like a typical Kroger division. If you look at -- in our merger model, that's the type of timeframe that we used. And we wouldn't see it any different today than -- I don't know, Mike, any other insight you would want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: I agree with you. We aren't going to go too fast and we aren't going to go too slow. And if we were to have a bias towards one or the other, it will be a little bit slower than a little bit too fast because what we have seen in the broad spectrum of M&A out there is when folks go -- try to go a little too fast, they're usually not as successful long-term. 
Kelly Bania: Got it. And just wanted to maybe end with just a question on Simple Truth. I think you said it was growing at an incredible rate. I think it's been in the double-digit range in the past. Just what are you seeing there? What are you expecting from Simple Truth in 2016? I think you mentioned some new categories that have been launched in the recent year. How are you thinking about even more categories? Or what are you expecting, really, from that in 2016? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Your -- it has been incredibly strong. As I mentioned it was $1.5 billion brand for us last year. And if you recall, 3 years ago, is when we launched the brand. We're finding very good early results. We're really looking at it more as a lifestyle brand versus narrow or just food and the additional categories we've added, the -- it's been very good initial customer connection. So we really see continued growth opportunity for the brand and probably even stronger than what we would have thought initially. So it's exciting. 
W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As you know, a lot of our associates listen into the call each quarter. Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers, each other and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter, like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store. Just awesome. 
 Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work. Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension and other benefits, you told us that work-life balance is important, too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family and other events and responsibilities; 14 of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now. And several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We work closely with our union locals who introduced this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive. 
 As always, thank you, again, for your continued commitment to Kroger and our customers. That completes today's call. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q3  (2015-12-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to The Kroger Co. third quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. 
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. 
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would like to thank you for attending our 2015 investor conference in October. We appreciated the opportunity to share with you our strategy and to give you a chance to hear from other members of our senior management team.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Hopefully, you saw our announcement earlier this week that Cindy Holmes has been promoted to Senior Director of Pension Investments. I wanted to take a moment to thank Cindy for her service in Investor Relations. Both Mike and I appreciate Cindy's efforts these past several years, which you know have been exciting and transformative years for Kroger. We know she will continue to contribute to Kroger's success in her new role.
 I'd also like to introduce Kate Ward, who has been promoted to Director of Investor Relations. Kate joined Kroger in 2001 and has held a number of leadership roles in our audit and finance departments. We hope you'll join us in welcoming Kate to her new role.
 We often say that Kroger's success starts and ends with our more than 400,000 associates connecting with our customers every day. Our third quarter results are a terrific example of our team's ever deepening connection with customers. We achieved our 48th consecutive quarter, that is 12 consecutive years, of positive identical supermarket sales growth with very strong ID sales of 5.4%. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to manage costs so that we can continue investing to grow our business for the future while delivering today. Based on Kroger's strong third quarter performance, we are raising our identical supermarket sales guidance and our net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year.
 During the third quarter, we contributed $80 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to help stabilize pension benefits for our associates while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value. In January 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan by working with the union to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. This agreement protected pensions already earned and provided greater stability for future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates. In June 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. All of these steps reflect our strategic decision to increase certainty of pension benefits for our associates. These are examples of how we identify opportunity to use our financial flexibility.
 We are very excited about our pending merger with Roundy's. We have filed our tender offer documents, and while we wait for the conclusion of that process and regulatory approval, I simply want to reiterate how much we are looking forward to welcoming Roundy's team to the Kroger family of stores.
 The economy overall continues to slowly improve, and customers continue to feel more optimistic. But the bifurcation in the economy remains. Some customers are willing to spend more while others are worried about their job or next paycheck, are more focused on saving. We find that all customers want quality products and a great shopping experience. For the customer who's more focused on natural and organic products, we have our own Simple Truth brand. We also have many entry-level price point items of excellent quality. For customers looking for incredibly high-quality products like Boar's Head or Murray's Cheese, just to name a couple, we have that, too. Our job is to understand and deliver for our diverse set of customers so that they can save where they want to save and splurge where they want to splurge.
 Finally, before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to note that there is an important global dialogue taking place that underscores the positive role businesses can play in sustainability. Kroger's team has been making progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operations. For example, our stores and manufacturing facilities have made significant progress by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. In 5 years, the number of stores recycling food waste has increased 73% from 290 to more than 1,000 this year. 30 of our 37 manufacturing plants are sending zero waste to landfills, an increase of 9 facilities since 2013. 
 Taken together, along with a lot of other efforts, Kroger is sending 69% less waste to landfills than we used to, and we will continue to work toward zero waste. This is only possible due to the thousands of individual activities our associates are doing on a daily basis. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live, and they have helped Kroger earn a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This is obviously something we're very proud of. We look forward to sharing our new 5-year sustainability goals with an eye toward pushing even faster and having more accelerated progress in the near future. 
 As you can see, we have a lot going on at Kroger. I am thrilled with our financial results and what we are doing for our associates, our customers, our communities and shareholders. 
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter results, provide an update on labor relations and an update on our guidance for 2015. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Rodney's comments relative to Cindy and also welcome Kate to the team.
 First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas from our long-term growth plan. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. As Rodney noted earlier, we are very pleased with our 5.4% identical supermarket sales growth in the third quarter. It reflects the underlying strength of our core business and our associates' growing connection with customers. Identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of very strong tonnage growth plus an increase in both the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household in the third quarter. 
 As you know, our goal is to grow the number of loyal households at a faster rate than the number of total households who shop with us. I'm happy to report that we continue to meet this goal quarter after quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel during the quarter, with our deli and produce departments leading the way. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department.
 Our second market -- our second metric is FIFO operating margin without fuel. Several items are included -- are excluded from our third quarter rolling 4 quarters calculations, specifically the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items, the contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2014 and third quarter of 2015. While items like this occur over time, we feel it is important to report how our operations are performing. On this basis and without fuel, FIFO operating margin increased 18 basis points in the third quarter.
 Our operating margin has expanded more than our goal largely due to a combination of 2 factors: first, continued stronger-than-expected ID sales; second, the continued incremental investments we are making in our Customer 1st Strategy are being made in a sustainable way based on insights from 84.51°. This is not a new normal for operating margin expansion, but rather a demonstration of our diligence in how and when we invest.
 Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.16%. We are not presenting the comparative number this quarter because of last year's third quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase from fiscal 2014. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.
 Before I share our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current inflationary environment. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the third quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.1% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. We saw deflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all -- I'm sorry, we saw inflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all deflationary. We continue to see inflation in pharmaceuticals.
 Now I'll share our third quarter results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable influence that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the third quarter were affected by the lower retail price of fuel, much like in the second and third quarters -- or first and second quarters. The average price of fuel during the third quarter was $2.30 compared to $3.22 last year. Total sales in the third quarter increased 0.4% to $25.1 billion compared to $25 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.
 In the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $428 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $362 million or $0.36 per diluted share, including a $0.02 benefit due to certain tax items. Excluding this, Kroger's net adjusted earnings were $345 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. These numbers don't sum due to rounding.
 Kroger recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the third quarter compared to an $85 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We have lowered our full year LIFO expectation to $75 million from $90 million previously. The FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 4 basis points from the same period last year.
 Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage core operating expenses as a rate of sales in the third quarter. Total operating expenses excluding retail fuel operations, a $25 million contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third quarter of 2014 and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in the third quarter of '15 decreased 23 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Third quarter FIFO profit excluding fuel and the adjustments I mentioned just a moment ago increased approximately $66 million over the prior year.
 Now for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.238 compared to $0.232 in the same quarter last year. Fuel results have been more difficult to predict than normal. We do not expect fuel margins to remain this -- we did not expect fuel margins to remain this high this late in the year. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is a moderation in margins. Volatility in weekly fuel costs remain high, and where those costs end up will influence our fourth quarter results.
 Corporate Brands' performance during the third quarter was strong, representing approximately 27.7% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing rate, setting a record high for total sales in the third quarter while continuing to establish all-time weekly sales records throughout the quarter. Our newest Brand, HemisFares, has been embraced by foodie customers so much so that we are currently working with our Sicilian gelato supplier to expand capacity while maintaining the best-in-the-world quality of the product.
 I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We ratified contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Denver and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. We are currently negotiating a contract with the UFCW for store associates in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Kroger's long-term financial strategy is to use its financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders. Maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating is the cornerstone of this, and it allows the company to use cash flow to take advantage of strategically and financially compelling opportunities and to continue its fill-in strategy, repurchase shares and fund the dividend, which is expected to increase over time. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 853,000 common shares for a total investment of $31 million.
 Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities totaled $832 million for the third quarter compared to $681 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities to slightly exceed $3.3 billion for the year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects and are encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects. 
 The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.99 compared to 2.27 during the same period last year. We expect our net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio to remain under 2.2 upon the close of our Roundy's merger transaction. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.5 billion during the same period last year. As I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.2 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $160 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to bondholders and shareholders while creating opportunities for our associates.
 Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for the remainder of 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $2.02 to $2.04 for fiscal 2015. The previous guidance was $1.92 to $1.98 per share. This range exceeds the company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that's expected to increase over time. As with our third quarter results, the performance of fuel in the fourth quarter will determine where we end up in the range. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel of 4% to 4.5%. As we said in our press release this morning, that implies an annual guidance range of approximately 5% to 5.25%.
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered another spectacular quarter and marked our 12th consecutive year of positive quarterly identical sales -- supermarket sales growth. When you achieve such consistently remarkable results quarter after quarter, it's easy to take them for granted. In fact, we've spent the past few years investing in our unique and multifaceted business model, which we believe has been a key driver of our success. We continually strive to innovate for our customers while delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. At a time when so many other retailers are facing very difficult circumstances, Kroger continues to stand out from the pack, thanks to our incredible associates. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
 Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: It's actually Judah on for Ed. And congrats to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. First, just wanted to ask about the Q4 comp guidance. Is that an indication of where you're running Q4 to date? Or is there just some conservatism built into that given that you're early on in a big quarter? 
W. McMullen: If you look at so far, and obviously, it's still very early in the quarter and we're cycling very strong numbers a year ago, we would be at the top end of the range that we provided. So it really isn't trying to be conservative. It's just reflecting the fact that we're cycling some incredibly strong numbers and inflation continues to get a little lower. The other thing that you never know is how is the weather going to flow. Obviously, snow is helpful for the business, and that, you really don't -- you can't predict at all. And then, as Mike just mentioned to me, this year, we will not have a Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. A year ago, we had Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. 
Judah Frommer: Okay, that makes sense. And then touching on the gross margin performance. I mean, you've lapped Harris Teeter fully now, and we still don't see a lot of investment in margin. I mean, maybe Mike referenced it in that you're doing good work with 84.51°. But is this kind of a new normal, like a less than 10 basis point investment in ex fuel gross margin? 
J. Schlotman: I'll hesitate to give what a normal is for an investment because we do continue to make investments in price in a variety of areas of our store. I'd say it's a reflection of prudence on how and when we make investments. Additionally, the mix. When you look at the strength of brands like Simple Truth, when you look at the strength of natural and organics, all of which have a little bit higher gross margin, that certainly plays into the overall mix of business. But if you were to look at gross margins by department, you'd probably have a little bit different view of exactly how and when we invest. But we will continue to invest not only in price but all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy. 
W. McMullen: And we continue to have strong growth in our fresh departments, and most of the fresh departments have higher gross as well. 
Operator: And the next question will come from William Kirk of RBC. 
William Kirk: So you guys are very good at data analytics and targeted marketing. So I was wondering, what are you seeing in terms of available promotional dollars and how they're being allocated in store versus out of store? And I guess the question is kind of for the industry and more specifically, if it's any different for you at Kroger. 
W. McMullen: Well, obviously, we really don't know what's going on across the industry because we only know what's happening for us. What we've tried to do is to work with our CPG partners, and we really do view them as partners. And what we're trying to focus on is how to grow their business and grow our business both. And it's really trying to make sure that we effectively spend the money that they provide to us that we then, in turn, provide to our customers. So it's really taking that data and helping our CPG partners to most effectively spend their money. So all I can do is talk for what we're doing. I really don't know what's going on in the industry. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: Congratulations to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. I think most folks were pleased with the results and the outlook, and it seems like you might be taking a somewhat conservative approach because of things like fuel gross margin, inflation and weather. So wondering if you could run us through some of the puts and takes in the fourth quarter. And more specifically, what type of fuel gross margins are you baking in? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the puts and takes, as Rodney said, weather is often difficult to predict. Last year, actually, was a pretty favorable weather event for us. Not only did we have the Super Bowl right at the end of the fourth quarter, we also had a fairly large snow event in the Midwest at the end of the fourth quarter, and both of those served to have some pretty strong sales that very last week of the quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, the ability to predict fuel margins this year has been more difficult than I can remember since we've been in the fuel business, which is really since 1983 when we merged with Dillon Companies. It's not just where weekly retails and supply and things like that wind up, it's really the day-to-day volatility of fuel on the open market because we don't have fuel contracts, we buy everything in the open market. And frankly, we're very -- we feel good -- we feel very good about where our core business is going, the day-to-day runnings inside of our store and the ability to predict that and the strength of our ID sales, as we noted with the guidance for the fourth quarter. Where we wind up in the $2.02 to $2.04 will be wholly predicated on where fuel margins wind up for the quarter. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. And as a follow-up, what are you sort of expecting in pharmacy margins? And also, I don't know, it might be too early, but any color on 2016 puts and takes as well? 
W. McMullen: A couple. On pharmacy, it continues to be tough as it's been all year, and there's obviously a ton of change going on. And what we really remain focused on is making sure we're helping our customers. We have a great team of friendly and knowledgeable professionals that will help our customers get healthy quicker, and it eliminates one stop somewhere else. When you look at overall, we feel like we have a very strong business model, and it's also the nice thing about having such a diverse business, when you look at across all our lines, that we can make investments in pharmacy, but when you look at the total business, it continues to perform well. Relative to 2016 guidance, I'll say a couple of comments, Mike, and if you want to add anything, but we'll give the details in March. We have a meeting where we review our objectives with our board, and that -- obviously, we're not going to share things publicly until the board is in concert with what we're doing. A couple of comments just to remind everyone, and it really ties back to some of the things that Mike and I have already said. Fuel margins, we would expect to more normalize. And if you look at inflation, we would expect it to continue to be less. But when you look at overall, and this isn't just for '16, but our long-term objective remains to grow earnings per share by 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. And that's the long-term objective. And then we'll give more detail in '16. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Erica Eiler: This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Just following up on your inflation comment just now. Just curious if you have any specific expectations for Q4. And then specifically, next year, I mean, you mentioned you expect it to go lower. I mean, any thoughts with regards to how we should think about generic drug inflation for the upcoming year? 
J. Schlotman: Generics continue to have a good amount of inflation in them. We really don't see anything as we look into 2016 that would necessarily cause a moderation. Part of that was driven by prices had gotten so low, some folks got out of the manufacture of those products. With good old supply and demand and just basic economic forces, if underlying costs for those continue to be high, at some point, other folks will get back into the manufacture of that business and perhaps put pressure on that economic cycle. Relative to inflation for the fourth quarter, our view would be it would be in the range of where the third quarter was and in the low 1s. And as we look into next year, we would certainly expect full year inflation for next year probably to be comparable to where inflation is for this year. We don't see a lot out there in the overall supply chain that would cause this to be different. 
Erica Eiler: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to your loyalty program offering. I mean, we've seen a number of the specialty grocers recently discuss plans for new loyalty programs with different propositions for consumers across each. Clearly, Kroger has had success with fuel points in recent years. I guess I'd just be curious, how often do you tweak the value proposition with your loyalty card offering? How important is the points part of the offering versus maybe some of the other components that your program offers? Any thoughts that you could share, that would be really helpful. 
W. McMullen: Well, we would look at our loyalty program as not tweaking. What we do is we continually use the insights to improve what our customers get, and it's based on how customers react. So it's constantly using what customers actually do to try to do a better offer for our customers on a personalized basis. And the examples you gave would just be small parts of what the overall loyalty offering is for a customer. And the key is -- for anybody doing it is how do you make it worth something the customer finds of value. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: Cindy, we'll miss you, and Kate, look forward to working with you. I just wanted to follow up -- go back to 2016 on a higher level. I guess, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the Medicare Part D component because I guess the color would be that the reimbursement rates could come down fairly meaningfully. And so that -- I realize that could be maybe a bigger headwind for you in 2016. Obviously, gas margins are a wild card. But then as I think about maybe tailwind for '16, Roundy's accretion could be a bit more of a tailwind than you've guided to, inflation is kind of neutral. Any more color you could give on any of those? 
J. Schlotman: We won't -- as Rodney said, we're not going to go too far down the path of talking about 2016. Clearly, the litany of things you laid out, it's almost as if you have a draft of our business plan board book that we're getting ready to finish up at the end of the month and send to our board about the topics we will discuss with them in January. All of those are on our radar screen. We're putting all of those into the mix as we decide what 2016 is going to look like with our board. As Rodney said, we're committed to the 8% to 11% as a long-term earnings per share growth target. And it just wouldn't behoove either he or I, if we want to be on the March call, to get out in front of our board with talking about '16 much more. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's fair. And I guess just looking at the O&A growth rate this quarter excluding rents and depreciation. I guess when I look at the last 3 quarters, it's been pretty consistent kind of in the 5.5% range, and I realize for next year, Roundy's is going to impact that number, but is that kind of -- do you think that's a fair run rate to look at on a more sustainable basis? 
J. Schlotman: The 5.5% -- I missed the first part of your comment. 
Karen Short: Well, it seems to be -- you've been kind of consistently in that 5.5-ish range for the first -- well, for the first 3 quarters of the year. So excluding what Roundy's might do to that number, is that kind of the right run rate to think about on a more sustainable basis? Because I know we've talked about there was some investments in services and things like that, that you were making because you knew it would drive sales. So I just kind of want an update on that. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I actually haven't calculated exactly what our OG&A growth has been, and I don't know if you're taking out the onetime items from those if you look at our core business. Our rate to sales is -- or if you're doing it with or without fuel. Our ongoing -- if I look at it without fuel, it's actually under -- year-to-date, it's actually under a 5% increase, and that's including the pension contribution in there. We look at those service investments the same way we look at price investments. And we step back and we have a very defined plan and a very diligent plan of what we expect to do in departments and how we expect to make incremental investments in all 4 keys of the Customer 1st Strategy. And some of those are price, which become more obvious because of the gross margin calculation. Others of those are a little less obvious because when you look at things like service, they can get drastically covered up. The whole idea of adding service in some of these departments would be to grow sales, and that's how they wind up getting paid for. So when you -- overall, we would expect to continue to drive operating costs down and use that as part of the fuel for the engine to continue to invest. 
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Cindy and Kate, congratulations on your new roles. Two questions from me. One, a little bit of a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier. But a lot of the CPG companies, especially on the packaged food side, right, companies that really -- like Kraft, right, they're running that 3G playbook. They're talking very vociferous actually about how they're trying to get off that promo needle, get much more about baseline sales. I'm not talking about any particular vendor, but are you seeing any evidence that, that's actually taking place, where a lot of your larger food vendors are perhaps getting a little bit less aggressive with deal-backs? Or is it really not affecting anything yet from your view? 
W. McMullen: Well, I will answer your question that -- well, partially answer your question. What we find is -- CPG companies, there's -- we deal with a lot of different CPG companies, and any point in time, you'll have different companies with different strategies. And we have a team that will work with CPGs based on the strategy that they're playing. What we find is when CPGs raise prices when it's not economically driven, our Corporate Brands always picks up market share. And it's one of the values of having an incredibly strong corporate brand program, is that when there's something that doesn't make economic sense, the customer understands that. So we -- at any point in time, probably almost any comment you would make on a CPG, there's somebody out there running that playbook, and each one would have their own playbook. 
Operator: And the next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to ask about your -- you gave some helpful commentary around the macro environment and kind of the puts and takes of the consumer spending behaviors. And if we try to, in a sense, kind of reconcile that with your natural, organic, your Corporate Brands specifically, of course, continue to tick up, what are you seeing as you're looking at your loyalty data? Have there been any notable changes in terms of kind of categories or products that are going into the basket more or less? And I guess, in turn, are you changing the way you're maybe space allocating in any way that might be helpful to share with us? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at -- there's constantly changes going on in the basket, and it's not so much new. But if you look at the fresh departments, that's been a trend that's been ongoing for a long period of time and isn't slowing down at all. The things that you ticked off -- mentioned on natural and organics, that as well. If you look at space allocation, it's something that is really important to do on an ongoing basis. And one of the examples I always like to give is coffee. If you asked me 3 years ago or 4 years ago, what I thought was going to be the future of the coffee category, I wouldn't have been very positive. Today, because of innovation by Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain, it's completely created a different type of growth in that category, and we're continually adding space on what's inside the store because the customers want it, and it's something that is driven by innovation. So the change in allocation is more driven by innovation than probably anything else and how the customers react to that innovation. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just on Roundy's, just checking, does it still look like the deal should be closing before the end of this calendar year? 
J. Schlotman: As Rodney said in our prepared comments, we filed our tender offer. And we filed with the regulators, and it's pending both of those coming to a closure. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Two questions. One, just on the inflation, I thought the commentary about produce is inflationary and meat, seafood, deli, et cetera, deflationary. Mike, I think you've made comments in the past about there's good deflation and bad deflation. And so as you're looking into fourth quarter and then into the 2016 overall inflation being similar, can you maybe speak to the components, sort of how inflation is playing out right now, if you guys think that produce still inflationary, sort of the same dynamics? And then remind us if these are better dynamics than other ways to get to this sort of lower level of inflation. And then if you can maybe just weave in what you're seeing in the competitive environment right now. Is it same, worse, better? 
J. Schlotman: Sure. Relative to inflation, it's -- overall, it continues to be a mixed bag and particularly when you look at the fresh departments, like produce, like meat, like seafood. Produce, in particular, it generally bounces around a lot during the year. When you see dramatic inflation in produce, it's not a good selling season because it's been bad growing for whatever region it is that's there. Earlier in the year, when we saw a lot of dramatic deflation in produce, it was driven by 2 things. One, last year's first quarter was relatively strong inflation, and then this year, you had a good growing crop. So you're really back to a more normal kind of a crop for produce. And actually, if you look at on a 2-year basis, the first quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, combined, they were slightly inflationary. So it's a more of a normal. While the fourth quarter was inflationary, it was just slightly inflationary. Meat, obviously, has gotten a lot of headlines as having been so high for so long, high prices. Clearly, with what supply and demand do, high prices over time, people stop eating as much meat and -- whether it's beef or chicken or pork. That means supply picks up a little bit, and guess what, prices start to come down. And if you look at it on a -- if a 2-year stack on something like inflation makes any sense at all, we're still net higher than we were a couple of years ago but still well down from peaks of last year. So it's a mixed bag. We think things like that are going to persist into 2016. The wild card is always where -- exactly where is pharmaceutical inflation going to be, and it has been very, very high for really the last couple of years. Relative to the competitive environment, I don't think there's a time that Rodney and I have been doing these calls together that we haven't talked about this being a highly competitive industry. Barriers to entry are low. Our job is to go out every day with our more than 400,000 associates and deliver a better value proposition to our customers today than we did yesterday, and that's solely what we're focused on. Sure, we keep an eye on the competitive environment. There are a lot of people out there trying to sell what we sell, and our job is just to do it a little bit better every day and win that customer every day when they wake up and make sure they want to come to Kroger. 
Robert Ohmes: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Could you guys give us a click list update on those, I think it was 19 non-Harris Teeter stores and how that's progressing? 
W. McMullen: Yes. It's still something that -- we're still early in the test. We continue to roll it out for customers. Some customers like it a lot, and it's just one more reason to shop at Kroger. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So I just wanted to get back to something you mentioned on the gross margin, which was with the mix shifting. I wanted to get your perspective on kind of what inning we're in on that mix shift. I mean, obviously, you've got fast-growing categories like private label, been a few private label, you have the fresh categories. I do believe you guys are in the process of updating your prepared food area as well, which tends to have a lot better gross margins. So as we look out, and this is really not next year, it's really more of a 3-year outlook, it seems to me that this mix shift should remain and maybe even accelerate and be helpful. Am I off base on that? 
J. Schlotman: Scott, it's a phenomena that continues, and to say what inning we would be in on the changing needs and desires of the consumer would be -- would probably be shortsighted on my part and I would be absolutely wrong. We certainly do a lot of predictive analytics with data we see not just inside our stores but overall in the economy, trying to figure out where the consumer is going. It clearly does seem as though there's going to be persistence in the shift to a more healthy lifestyle and maybe out of some of the traditional center-of-the-store categories and into more fresh categories. But I would tell you there are plenty of center-of-the-store categories that now have natural and organic offerings in a can, whether it's our own Simple Truth brand with spaghetti sauces and salsas and things like that. If you go down the dog food aisle, the growth in the dog food aisle is in grain-free and natural kinds of dog food. So even our pets are jumping onto the bandwagon of leading a healthier lifestyle. Everybody's laughing at me in the room by the way. But it's something that our job is to make sure we're there to deliver what the customer wants when they want it. And we will certainly stay on track with it. In trying to predict where the customer is going, I don't think I'll get into that. But we're happy with our overall offering. We're happy with our continued growth and thrilled with the team we have working on not just the center of the store and keeping it a healthy and vibrant category but all the fresh departments around the perimeter of the store as well. 
W. McMullen: Scott, you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you know one of the things that we try to do is make sure we design our business model so it's successful regardless of the environment and try to really play to what's going on in the environment. And some of those examples, that's what's going on now, but customers change and we try to make sure that we stay nimble enough to be able to react to those changes. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay, perfect. And then I actually had a question, at the Analyst Day, you guys laid out a very compelling case about market share and how that drives returns over time and that one of the big growth drivers you see for Kroger is taking some markets that maybe are a little bit below where the ideal share is and driving them up. As I survey your business, one of those areas seems to be the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast that happen to be with Harris Teeter. How do we think about those areas geographically and what you can do to maybe get the market shares up over 20% to really drive some handsome returns? 
W. McMullen: The -- we -- other than at the Analyst Day, we did give specifics on one market. We won't make it a habit of giving specifics, so we really do look at across all of the opportunities. When we merged with Harris Teeter, one of the things we talked about was one of the reasons we were excited about merging with Harris Teeter is the opportunities that they had in several of the markets that you mentioned. We're equally or more excited today about that opportunity going forward as when we merged with Harris Teeter. So beyond that, I won't get into any more specifics on a market, other than, as we outlined, we see this as a long-term opportunity across a lot of markets. 
Scott Mushkin: So you would -- densing up would be -- would definitely help you guys in those markets. 
W. McMullen: Well, it would help us in most of our markets. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. As we've long said, the higher our market share, the higher our ROA in a particular market, and that's really the cornerstone to increasing the number of markets with that high correlation. 
Operator: And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: It's actually Steve on for John today. As it relates to the capital development program, is there a focus on speeding up the pace of investments here, I guess, to capitalize on some opportunities? Or should we still assume the $200 million of incremental spend annually looking out? 
J. Schlotman: Well, again, I won't get into what our guidance is for 2016. But we do continue to have a great pipeline of projects and are very encouraged by our early projects. We will continue to grow capital as we go into 2016 compared to 2015. The $200 million is a number that I would say, for the next several years, we would increase capital by at least that amount. Keep in mind, as I increase capital and I increase my base -- my store base and the number of stores, I also have to increase maintenance capital a little bit to keep those stores fresh over time. So it's not just an allocation -- a new allocation to new stores. I'm going to have to make sure I continue to take care of the base operations as well. 
W. McMullen: And part of the thing that Mike talked about on speeding up, it's really our real estate teams, our facility engineering teams, our division teams and our attorneys working together to take time out of the process on how long it takes us to get a store open. So it's really everybody working together, actually taking weeks out of construction time, which is causing some of the acceleration of capital investment. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
Steven Forbes: And just a follow-up. As we try to figure out, right, the impact here of the development program, can you touch or remind us of, I guess, the normal comp maturation of a marketplace or the maturation of the store-level EBITDA margin? 
J. Schlotman: When you said the normal comp maturation, what do you mean? 
Steven Forbes: I guess, the store opens at an initial productivity of 70% or so. I mean, what is -- year 1 and year 2, right, there's going to be a benefit on the comp side. Do you see a pretty significant ramp both in comp and profitability on the store -- at the store level? Because year 1... 
J. Schlotman: Clearly, when you open a store, the first 6 to 12 months of that store opening, with all the preopening costs that get expensed on the day you open, it takes a while for that store to turn black on an EBITDA standpoint. It doesn't become a comp store until the fifth full quarter that it's open, the way we do IDs. So it's a while before they contribute to IDs. In some markets, as we dense up, you have the potential to have a little bit of sister store impact. So from a total sales standpoint, you're getting exactly what you want wanted. From an ID standpoint in a particular geography, you may have a little degradation in a particular geography from their ID sales as you dense up in a particular market. Now some of these markets, our market share is low enough where that won't be as big of a deal, but we continue to monitor that as well. 
Operator: And the next question is from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: On the ID sales, I want to compare them to Q2 because it was kind of the same number both for the print and for the inflation. So I think I recall in Q2, you said it was very much volume-driven, and I'm not sure you said that here. I think I hear you talking a little bit more about mix. Should we take away from that, that, that number has a better mix element this quarter than last quarter? 
W. McMullen: It was heavily driven by volume again. Very strong. I just... 
J. Schlotman: Yes. In my prepared comments, I said it was a combination of very strong tonnage plus an increase in the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household during the time frame. So it's a combination of all of those. 
W. McMullen: But tonnage was very, very strong. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay, good to hear. So there's no real update on mix, it's sort of the bifurcated message continues. 
W. McMullen: It really is the same thing that continues to play out. But it -- now it's playing out on top of years where it played out, so it's growth on top of growth. 
Andrew Wolf: Two more follow-ups. On 84.51°, you've been asked about it and you pointed to it. Can you maybe call out some areas of the marketing where it really is helping? We're used to sort of unique promotions, but is it also in pricing? And I know Vinny asked about allocation, but could you give us a high level there as to where it's currently -- is it helping the business more than it has maybe as we're used to hearing about? And also, when you announced the split from dunnhumby you said you could probably work with some -- or excited to work with similar companies. Any update there would be helpful as well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. On working with other companies, that we wouldn't share at this point other than saying that we continue -- that's something that is part of what we're allowed to do now, and we work against that. On helping more than the past, one of the things -- even some of the examples that you gave, just by continuing to learn and continuing to be more integrated, we're making progress on top of where we were. So to me, the biggest improvement and change has been, in the meetings now, the 84.51° team is part of the same meeting. So you're not having a discussion and deciding what to do and then going out -- going back and sitting down with 84.51° to say, "Okay, here's what we want you to do." It's actually everybody in the same meeting and their insights to say, "Well, you're thinking about this, but it's probably better if you think about it this way." And it's really the professional insights and experiences that's helping us accelerate where we are versus necessarily just doing something new. 
J. Schlotman: And in the past, while we owned half of them, they would have not been always around the table initially because we did only own half of them and they had obligations outside the Kroger world as well. So we have time for -- you had another follow-up? 
Andrew Wolf: Yes. Just real quick on the $80 million pension contribution. I assume that was contemplated in your guidance, either for the quarter or for the year. I just wanted to double check that. 
J. Schlotman: It is contemplated in the guidance, in the $2.02 to $2.04 for the year. Those are things that, with some of the strong fuel margins, rather than that happening a little bit every so often, we've taken opportunity to put the money in when we have that tailwind. It gets the money into the fund, and they can start putting it to work faster than if we did it over time. 
Operator: And that last question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: And I'll just reiterate the good luck to Cindy in the pensions. And I just wanted to ask a question about relative price gaps. I feel like everywhere I turn in the industry, someone's telling me just how aggressive you're being with price. Our studies show something similar, and your gross margin is just holding up remarkably well. You talked about the mix. But I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you feel about your relative price gaps. Do you think you've maintained them, widened them? What do you think the plan for next year is? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at longer term, we've always assumed that markets will get more competitive, and that's been part of our business model really starting -- Dave caused us to start that years ago, and it's something that we just couldn't [indiscernible]. And we don't see that changing at all. The gap, I guess I would word it a different way. You're always trying to get better, but you're proud of where -- the progress you've made. And it's something that's very important for us to be able to make sure that we're giving our customers a better and better deal. Price is one element of that, but service is just as important, and we're focused as much on that in terms of fresher product and better service as well. And all of those things together is what we think creates a unique model for Kroger, and it's driving a lot of our success. 
Kelly Bania: Great, that's helpful. And then just a question on the pension contribution. It seems like -- I don't know if I'm thinking about this but -- the right way, but when you have these very strong gas margin environment that generates a little extra cash and earnings, you kind of offset that with these kind of onetime contributions. Is that the right way to think about that in terms of how you plan for these? And then just what is the status of the consolidated UFCW plan at this point? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the status of it, it's in great shape. Cindy will make sure it stays that way. We did joke internally that it was her going-away present from IR to the pension group, but that wasn't. We -- these funds will need money over time. The -- our enrollment in these plans continues to grow. Folks continue to earn benefits. We have a great investment strategy, but they do require funds over time. And while we would budget them in to be made at different points in time, as I said earlier, when we have the opportunity and a little bit of tailwind and a few extra dollars in the coffers, we feel it's prudent to go ahead and put that money into the fund, let the fund put that money to work as quickly as possible to generate the return and continue to have strong benefits for our associates. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Kelly. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As I said a few minutes ago, Kroger's consistent outstanding results are easy to take for granted. The fact is your hard work in our stores and facilities every day makes it all possible. Your commitment to our customers brings our Customer 1st Strategy to life. In large and small ways, each and every day, what you do makes these terrific results possible. 
 The holiday season is such a special time of the year in our stores all over the country. You help millions of customers every day prepare for celebrations at their schools, offices, churches, homes and more. Thank you for your hard work to make the holidays brighter for each of them. You also make it a season of giving by working with Feeding America, the Salvation Army and other local community partners who help work with us to donate food and other items where they are needed most. Thank you, and thank you for being part of our big Kroger family. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and your family.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q2  (2015-09-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 Please save the date for our 2015 investor conference, which we will hold at the New York Stock Exchange on October 27. Details will be coming soon, and we hope you can join us.
 I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And the next time you see Mike, please congratulate him on his well-deserved and well-earned promotion.
 We are pleased with our second quarter results. Our 5.3% identical supermarket sales growth, without fuel, allowed us to continue investing in our business and delivering on our aggressive growth plan. Strong fuel margins toward the end of the quarter allowed us to deliver results that exceeded our original expectations.
 During the second quarter, we achieved our 47th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We kept costs down, which, together with identical supermarket sales growth, allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses at a rate of sales. And we continue to grow market share by improving our connection with customers, which fuels both our top and bottom lines and enables strategic Customer 1st investments. These consistently remarkable financial results are possible quarter after quarter because our business is built on the belief that serving customers is serving shareholders.
 Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share and identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. While customers continue to feel optimistic about the economy throughout the second quarter, they also continue to tell us they want to spend less. More and more, they want retailers to help them save money with sales and coupons. We are well positioned with our everyday low prices and our weekly sales and digital offers to solve this for our customers.
 As you know, the food retail business is in a constant state of change. Part of what makes our Customer 1st Strategy so powerful is it provides Kroger a firm foundation from which to approach new opportunities in the right way to benefit our customers, associates and shareholders. 
 While there are many examples where our business is rapidly evolving, I'd like to highlight 3 key areas of innovation and investment today: technology, food and people, and how the steps we are taking in each of these areas are broadening our competitive advantage for the future.
 We are actively expanding our use of technology in ways we believe will make a difference for customers and associates. This summer, we expanded our online ordering pilot in Cincinnati to 3 additional divisions. We are now offering our "order online, pick up at the store" solution in select Kroger stores in Louisville and Indianapolis and Fred Meyer stores in the Portland area. This is, of course, in addition to the Harris Teeter's successful Express Lane service.
 When you think about digital opportunities, we do not limit our focus to e-commerce. Digital for Kroger includes a broad range of efforts to interact with customers in increasingly relevant and meaningful ways, whether online or through our mobile app. A key metric is our measure of digital and household engagement, and during the second quarter, we continued to gain household engagement at record numbers.
 Our Kroger technology team continues to earn recognition for leading-edge initiatives to establish the Internet of Things in our stores. Earlier this summer, Kroger's electronic temperature monitoring project was named a winner of the CIO 100 Award by CIO Magazine. And as we shared with you in June, the talented team at 84.51° is helping us grow and evolve even faster due to their closer daily involvement in our business. 84.51°'s specialty, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly put the customer first, is a significant competitive advantage for Kroger.
 Our multitiered Corporate Brands portfolio has always been a powerful differentiator for Kroger. Simple Truth continues to see explosive growth. Private Selection remains a vibrant, billion-dollar brand that is growing in the double digits and developing unique offerings in many categories.
 I'm pleased to share with you that later this month, we will launch an entirely new brand called HemisFares. HemisFares brings only the best food finds from around the globe to our food-curious customers for an amazing authentic eating experience. It's a guided tour of the best tastes on the earth. Imagine landing in a country known for its incredible food and experiencing the finest examples of its region's most famous and delectable eats. Every HemisFares product is curated from the source and imported directly to our stores. The most exciting part is that no one else has a brand like this. HemisFares is a great example of what makes our Corporate Brands unique, and we think it will appeal to millennials, foodies and, ultimately, all cuffs of our customers. And by the way, I've tried a lot of the products, and it's outstanding. It's not just great. And I think you're going to love it when you get a chance to try it.
 Our reputation for consistently -- consistent execution rests squarely on the shoulders of our 400,000 associates who make it all happen in our stores, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities and offices. Our workforce is expanding rapidly to support our growth strategy. Last year, we created 25,000 new jobs, and right now, we are hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 new and permanent positions in our stores. We are looking for people who want to be part of a team, take pride in everything they do and want to grow with us.
 One important and untapped resource for new associates is our country's military veterans. Since 2009, more than 29,000 veterans have joined our ranks, and hundreds of current associates continue to actively serve in the military. Over the past several years, Kroger has formalized our military hiring initiatives. We joined the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies with the common goal of hiring transitioning service members and military veterans, and we have increased our presence at military recruiting events. 
 Next week, we are hosting our first ever Honoring Our Heroes hiring event, during which we will hold open interviews at every one of our supermarket locations on Tuesday, September 15, for all veterans and their family members. 
 The fact that nearly 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates or stocking shelves or bagging groceries speaks to Kroger's opportunity culture, which, we believe, is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be so in the future.
 Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to comment on our announcement yesterday of a new organizational structure for our senior leadership team. We take a team approach to leadership, and this new structure is designed to better align resources to our company's goals. It also streamlines decision-making and accelerates progress on our growth strategy. 
 As I said in our announcement yesterday, Kroger is incredibly fortunate to have such an exceptional strong group of leaders across our company, and our senior leadership team has unmatched depth and experience to continue delivering for our customers, associates and shareholders.
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter results, provide you an update on labor relations and update our guidance for 2015. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.
 Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Our identical supermarket sales growth of 5.3% in the second quarter demonstrates the strength of our core business. Our identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of strong tonnage growth and an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the second quarter. 
 We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at an even faster rate than total household growth during the quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, during the quarter. 
 We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong sales. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, I hope you got all that, increased by 20 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis.
 Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.24%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the last year's second quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect our return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from fiscal 2014 results. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.
 Before I share our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current operating environment, which has more volatility than normal, especially as it relates to fuel margins and inflation. We benefited from higher fuel margins late in the second quarter. As Rodney said, our nonfuel results were right in line with where we expected them to be. We expect fuel volatility to continue for the remainder of the year.
 Another factor that we are actively managing is product costs. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the second quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.4% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. Seafood and milk were deflationary, produce prices were less deflationary in the quarter, and we continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals. It bears repeating that if you look back over the past several years, we have had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers.
 Now I'll share our second quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable impact that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the second quarter were impacted by the lower retail price of fuel, much like the first quarter. The average price of retail fuel during our second quarter was $2.67 compared to $3.54 last year.
 Total sales in the second quarter increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion compared to $25.3 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year.
 In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $433 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $347 million or $0.35 per diluted share.
 Kroger reported a $21 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $26 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year.
 Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the second quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 35 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Second quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $93 million over the prior year.
 Now for retail fuel operations. In the second quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.19 compared to $0.183 in the same quarter last year. We expect fuel margins to continue to be volatile during the second half of the year.
 Corporate Brands performance during the second quarter was solid, representing an approximately 26.4% of total units sold and 25.1% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in Columbus and Memphis and have ratified all the local agreements associated with a master agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW store associates in Denver and Portland and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. 
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and a retirement benefit for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitability, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.
 Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.1 million common shares for a total investment of $43 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers and acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $812 million for the second quarter compared to $672 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be at the high end of the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. We are turning towards the high end because we see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects, and we continue to be encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects.
 The company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.02 compared to 2.32 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.1 billion during the same period last year. 
 Again this year -- or again this quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.1 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $426 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and shareholders while delivering value to our customers and increasing opportunities for our associates.
 Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 4% to 5% for 2015; the prior guidance was 3.5% to 4.5%. We also raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $1.92 to $1.98 for fiscal 2015; the previous guidance was $1.90 to $1.95 per diluted share. This range exceeds the company's net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We continue to expect the third quarter to be at the high end of our long-term growth range and the fourth quarter to be below the range. 
 Our second quarter results demonstrate that our base business is performing very well. The volatility of fuel in the back half of the year will determine where we end up within that range.
 Now I'll return it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Kroger's business is strong. Our team of associates continues to drive our Customer 1st strategy by taking care of our customers in big and small ways, offering fresh foods and keeping costs down so that we can reinvest those savings in our associates, store experience, products and prices. As a result, we continue to earn customer loyalty and gain market share. We are investing to grow our business for the future while delivering on our promises today. Our stores are hiring to fill 20,000 new permanent jobs. We are expanding our digital and e-commerce offerings. Our confidence in Kroger has never been stronger.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: I just -- I don't want to sound negative here, but I guess, what I'm wondering, in terms of your ID guidance for the year, it definitely reflects a slow-down in the 2-year comp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, even though it looks like inflation is maybe getting a little bit better, maybe less of a headwind. So I guess, any color there. Is this you kind of being conservative? Any color you could give would be helpful. 
W. McMullen: Well, it's -- the guidance is always one of the hardest things to come up with what's the right estimate. As you know, we've always expected inflation to continue to slow down during the year, and we would expect that to continue. Now, we're working hard, as always, to make sure that we're at a good side of that. If you look at where we are so far this quarter, we continue to track within those -- within the guidance and kind of similar to where we were in the second quarter. So we feel good about where we are, but -- and we see exciting opportunities. I don't know, Mike, did you want to... 
J. Schlotman: Yes, Karen, another thing to keep in mind is if you look at real growth, if you look at our current ID sales trend, and even what we would be projecting, and take away the relatively benign inflationary environment today, it's actually as strong of a real growth as we've had in quite some time, really, going all the way back to 3 or 4 years, actually 4 or 5 years. You really don't see a trend as strong as we have today when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis. Our tonnage growth is quite strong. And from our standpoint, as long as we continue to have the tonnage growth in many of the departments that we have, we'll be just fine, because that's the ultimate demonstration of the strength of your business is how many items are the customers buying on a weekly and monthly basis. 
Karen Short: Okay, and that's helpful. And then, I guess, also just on your guidance, I'm -- just was wondering, on your updated pension guidance, you have some changes in both the company and the multiemployer. It's unclear to me on the multiemployer if your prior guidance just didn't include the $60 million that was previously accrued, but you definitely also increased the company-sponsored. So obviously, you're raising your guidance even with these -- those 2 headwinds? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. The $60 million would have been accrued and expensed when it was accrued. Keep in mind that on the multiemployer plans, when you have a contractual obligation or actually put dollars in, you expense it, versus a company plan, we could put money in, and it may not translate to an -- a current expense. So they're quite different in how you account for the 2 calculations. I don't -- it's not a dramatic change in our expectations between the 2 plans, although somewhat... 
Karen Short: More of a headwind? Okay, I'll get back in the queue. 
J. Schlotman: It would be -- I mean, it would be a slight headwind compared to where we were earlier in the year, but nothing dramatic. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I wanted to touch on your pharmacy business. We've seen some of your competitors call out some headwinds within their pharmacy business on the margin line. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys are also seeing some headwinds within your pharmacy business as well on the margin line. 
W. McMullen: As you know, one of the things that's so important for us is our total portfolio of businesses. And when you look, there's almost -- every year, you'll have something stronger and something else weaker. And if you look at the pharmacy business, what we would be experiencing would be pretty similar to what some of our competitors would talk about. We continue to have very strong growth on the number of scripts filled, and that has been true for a long period of time, and our pharmacy teams continue to do a great job on taking care of our customers. But in terms of financial, you -- it would be very similar to what some of the others have talked about. But it is the nice thing and the great thing about having a portfolio of businesses where some pieces are obviously growing well in excess of the total. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, great. And then, switching topics to maybe expenses. So the leverage this quarter is much better than what we saw last quarter. Besides sales leverage, was there anything else that may have contributed to the better leverage this period? 
J. Schlotman: I think it's really across-the-board good cost controls in many facets of the business. As we often say here at Kroger, sales are a beautiful thing. And when you can have north of 5% IDs, the sale leverage -- sales leverage on the expense line becomes quite enormous. And particularly if your ID sales start to exceed where your own expectations were, it gets a little tough to add hours as fast as the sales start to come, and it takes a while to catch up to that. So there was -- there could have been a bit of that as well. But I wouldn't say there is any one particular area that would stand out. It's really pretty strong across-the-board cost controls for many locations. 
W. McMullen: One of the other things that we mentioned on the first quarter, we were pretty aggressive on incrementally investing hours in some places. Some of that, you begin to get the flow of it and you understand, where does it make sense and where doesn't it make sense as well. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So, guys, 2 things. Do you think -- when you look at the momentum the business has and the things you have to invest in, have we gotten to a point where it's really hard to keep ex fuel EBIT margin to just up slightly, right, without making investments that you don't think have a return? Or you think -- do you think we're just in a period here where timing of investments had been slower, and that's partly why you're getting the 20 basis points? 
W. McMullen: I -- when you look at the business overall, I would still feel that slightly improving is where -- is the right thing, long term, for the business and what creates the most sustainable long-term value for the business, and obviously, then, flow through to our shareholders. It's never as easy to be exactly precise every quarter in terms of where you invest and how do the margins flow through. So I feel good about where we are, but I certainly don't believe, as I look forward, to cause us to do anything to adjust what we -- the guidance we've provided. I don't know, Mike, any additional insight? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, and one of the things to keep in mind, John, is we -- as you know, we have a portfolio of things we want to invest in over time. And these aren't promotional activities. To your point, we aren't going to go out and have crazy promotional activity that's not going to be sustainable and drive long-term growth. But we have a portfolio of things we want to continue to invest in. And frankly, some of the strength we're experiencing today is on the backs of some of the investments we made in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you make a little bit of an investment, and then, several months later, you start to see the fruits of that investment. And that's one of the things that's leading to the strong IDs we've had in the first half. And we've tried to get into this rhythm where we're more diligent about when we invest, how we invest, balanced up against consistent results. And I think we're doing as good a job as we've ever done, and we still have that portfolio of areas where we would like to invest in. 
John Heinbockel: And then, Rodney, you talked about the organizational structure, which is quite different than you've had as far back as I can remember. And you said sort of right for this time. Maybe more specifically, what do you think this structure gives you benefit-wise? And then, it does sound like every -- a lot of the guys will have more direct reports than they did before. What do you have to do, if anything, different in how you run the business tactically to account for that, that people would be overseeing more than they had previously? 
W. McMullen: Well, a big part of that is just the growth that the team has had. I feel very comfortable that the growth they've had as leaders will allow them to have a little broader span of control than they've had before. As you know, we're incredibly fortunate to have such a great depth of people, and we're incredibly fortunate that they've been at Kroger for a long time. So they really know our business well and they understand what we're trying to get done. For me, it really does eliminate one layer of decision-making, and it really does streamline this -- our ability to make decisions. And the team is working together so well as a team, and I'm just really excited about -- going forward, I think it'll just make it a lot smoother in terms of how the -- how we operate on a day-to-day basis. 
Operator: And the next question is from Stephanie Chang of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: It's actually Ed Kelly here asking a question for Stephanie. So I guess, my first question for you -- well, my one question... 
W. McMullen: Your one question. Very good. 
Edward Kelly: I have a follow-up. But so just related to IDs. I mean, your IDs are clearly exceeding expectations. You're raising the full-year guidance for the ID again this quarter. I would guess that the level of inflation is less than what you probably thought coming into the year. And Mike, you talked about it with tonnage, right, being the strongest that it's kind of been in some time. Could you just maybe help us understand how you're driving such strong growth in the business? And maybe even what's surprising you as you look at the top line performance today. 
W. McMullen: The -- it's a great question. And to me, the thing that is so important about what Kroger has been doing for a long period of time, not just in this quarter, is really focusing on multiple aspects of connecting with our customers and associates. So it's really -- we continue to improve the products that our customers have. We -- our merchandisers continue to find new ideas and new products. Our operators continue to improve execution and figuring out ways to take cost out of the business, and we continue to take that and invest in what the customers tell us is important. So it's really all of those things working together. The thing that you never know is how do -- how will competitors react to what you're doing and how -- customers continually change and how do you make sure that you're staying out in front of those changes. So far this year, we're incredibly delighted with how we've identified how the customer's evolving and changing and connecting with those customers in a deeper and deeper way. Our customers tell us, from the way that our associates serve them, the products we deliver, the prices, that we've continued to improve what we're doing, and it's really the combination of all those things working together. 
Edward Kelly: Maybe just a quick follow-up here on inflation. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to expect inflation to slow throughout the rest of the year. We have, I think, heard from one of your smaller competitors yesterday about particularly produce and maybe produce bottoming and getting better. So could you just maybe provide a little color on some of the categories and how you see that progressing throughout the rest of the year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, Ed, as I said in my prepared comments, the produce picture, actually, the deflation slowed. And actually, if you were to look at the very end of the quarter, there was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks. Nothing to write home about, but it was deflationary for the quarter but got less, and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter. You continue to see other categories out there that have a mixed bag. Grocery is still, let's call it, just north of flat, just a little bit of inflation, and that's a big driving factor in it. The other one to keep out -- to keep in mind, as you think about inflation, is pharmacy is a big inflationary area that I spoke of as well. The generic costs continue to go up. It's -- on the earlier question on the headwinds from gross margin in pharmacy, it's one of the reasons why that headwind exists, because you can't pass that on as quickly as the cost of the underlying pills go up. So it continues to be a mixed bag. You're seeing some of the meat complex get less inflationary and, in fact, deflationary in some areas, but still some slight inflation in other areas. Seafood is a little deflationary right now, but it continues to be a little bit all over the board. 
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to ask on the digital initiatives. You guys had said that a few more divisions now have the pick-up-at-store capabilities. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in terms of traction, usage there? What may be in the basket, and then maybe kind of some thoughts going forward for further rollout? 
W. McMullen: Well, the -- I -- to give you some insights, the -- it's -- what we find is some customers enjoy shopping that and -- in addition to still buying stuff in the store. So it's -- and you've heard us talk a long time about, on digital, we really do believe it's an and, and not an or. And all it is, is trying to offer one more way of a customer engaging with us so that they get engaged with us the way they want to versus the way they have to. And what we find is the customer feedback has been very positive for some customers, but it's not all customers. And the learnings that we were able to get from Harris Teeter is they really were able to accelerate teaching us how to do it, and then, our store associates are doing a great job of executing against that. In terms of specifics on going forward, the only thing, really, I would say is it continues to be something that we test, and will kind of -- the pace of which we go will really be driven by how fast the customers engage with us. And one of the things that we're trying to do as a company is pace things based on our ability to execute against it and the customer's connection with it. So I wouldn't be able to give you specifics right now because we really don't have specifics yet. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. No, that is helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, I'll stick with the digital initiatives. And I know you guys have said you're continuing to see some really nice growth in the loyal households. Have there been any changes on your end since the exclusivity with what was dunnhumby over the past couple of quarters has changed? Has there been any change in your approach to getting to know those loyal customers and who you -- who else maybe you are working with or not going forward? 
W. McMullen: The -- I wouldn't say there's been change. The thing that's probably the biggest difference is the leadership team at 84.51° is involved in every meeting now. And it's things when you're trying to make a decision on what you do, the folks are around the table, and they have great insights, so you're really having those insights as part of the decision at the front end rather than at the back end of the conversation. So the biggest thing is just the quality. To say that we get additional insights, I wouldn't say there's additional insight so far. I would say there's a lot of additional projects that we're working on that should help us going forward. That, I feel very confident in, that it just makes it a lot easier to get those things done rather than having to negotiate with a third party. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: There's been so much change in Southern California amongst some of your larger peers. And I realize it's not easy, maybe it's impossible to quantify, but can you give us a sense for how much those changes have either benefited you or created a more challenging competitive environment? Just thinking about some of the issues that Haggen has had, some of the changes that Albertsons put into place. If you can address that at all, I'd be appreciative. 
W. McMullen: Yes, the -- it's one of those where, obviously, it's a good question but hard to answer. When you look at our business in total in Southern California, we're very happy with where we are. But the thing -- the biggest thing that we think is driving it is our associates are doing a great job, and our leadership team there, in terms of improving how we serve our customers. Now whether it's things customers do -- or our competitors are doing that causes our customers to like what we're doing better, that I don't know. I think it's always important to remember that in Southern California, Costco is actually one of our biggest competitors. Whole Foods would be a huge competitor there. You have a ton of really high-quality independents there. So the competition there is very diverse and more than just the Safeway and Albertsons and their merger and  Haggen. So I really -- it's hard to say a certain part is because of whatever somebody is doing. And we're really much more focused on how are the customers telling us we're delivering against what they're asking for. Mike, anything you would want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, I agree. It's -- when there's any kind of disruption in a market, we look at it as an opportunity from a positive standpoint, not a woe-is-me, oh, what's going to happen, how are we going to deal with this. And when you -- when names change on banners, when people may go to market differently, the opportunity all exists that folks may look for a different place to shop that didn't do that in the past, and we want to make sure that Dawn [ph] and her team continue to do what they're doing to excite our customers and our associates in Southern California. 
Kenneth Goldman: And then, my follow-up, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly. You did say, I think, 3Q QTD ID sales, ex fuel, similar to what we saw in 2Q, right? [indiscernible] 
J. Schlotman: [indiscernible] What I said is quarter-to-date, it's pretty similar to where we are in quarter 2. 
Operator: And our next question is from William Kirk of RBC. 
William Kirk: So I had a question on Simple Truth. I think it's in some of your convenience stores now. I was just wondering how the brand's performing in that channel and how many C-stores it is in, I guess. 
W. McMullen: I'm looking... 
J. Schlotman: I've had C-stores for 2 days, and I already got it in there. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. How many it's in or how broad the... 
W. McMullen: Yes, on a few select items, it's in -- pretty broad in a lot of our convenience stores, but it's pretty narrow. It's early in the process, and we're really trying to learn how broad can the brand go and who all connects with it. As you know, historically, convenience stores isn't a place you go to for healthy offerings. And we are trying to make sure that the customer, if that's what they want, they can find what they want. So it's early in the process, but we are trying to learn how far the Simple Truth brand can go. 
William Kirk: Okay. And then, on, I guess, the M&A opportunity environment. We saw repurchases come down in the quarter, leverage is back to about where it was pre-Harris Teeter. How are you feeling about the M&A environment or opportunities in the -- out there? 
J. Schlotman: I would say our M&A appetite is the same as it's always been when the -- if the right opportunity comes along and it's the right set of stores, right sets of assets and right management team, we would think about it. There's not a lot that happens in the space that doesn't come across our desk. I wouldn't read anything into the share buyback coming down in the quarter to signal something on M&A activity. We were pretty upfront that we expected to front-end load our share repurchase program. And really, what you're seeing in the second quarter is the use of stock option proceeds and the tax benefit from that to repurchase shares to offset that dilution. And we're comfortable with our leverage where it is, and it allows us a lot of flexibility. And keep in mind, we are increasing capital, which consumes some cash as well. 
Operator: The next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the HemisFares rollout. It sounds like that would be a premium quality, premium price point category. And just curious, in exactly which categories are you going to be launching that? How many stores? And really just stepping back and thinking about how does that come to fruition at Kroger? I mean, what's the idea process in terms of bringing that to market? Did -- was that born out of an 84.51° kind of data science project? Or just any color on how that comes to market. 
W. McMullen: Well, the biggest thing it's -- it's really our Corporate Brands team would use the insights from 84.51° plus other research they've done. We find customers are increasingly becoming foodies, and it's really trying to figure out how do you find great products that will satisfy that foodie need experience they want in a way that is actually a very affordable price. And if you look at the quality of this product, if you would go to a restaurant and eat food -- eat something of this quality, it would cost 4 or 5x as much as what it costs with us. So customers get to experience something that's very unique that's outstanding quality. And it's really the team searching across the world, finding items that are very, very unique and very regionally based. The initial items -- I actually don't know how broad it is. I can tell you, the ones I've tried would be more pasta- and sauce-based and olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Those types of items are the ones that I've tried. So the things I've tried are more based from Italy, but I'm sure there's others. It's just that's the ones I'm familiar with. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, the whole idea of HemisFares is to allow our customers to take a journey of food experience around the globe without having to leave home. And it'll be very specific on the packaging where the product's from. The folks at our Corporate Brands who've procured this actually have met with and visited with and helped with the folks who manufacture this product or produce the product on-site in their home country. And some of this product, it's the first time that anybody's gone through the trouble of importing the product with some of the items in it into the U.S. that we have. So they've done a phenomenal job with this, and we're really excited about yet another great offering for our customers in the stores. 
W. McMullen: We would expect it to be in almost all of our stores. We think most customers will want to engage with it. On some of the items, there is a limited amount of production, so it's not something that you can just go out and produce 2x as much if it sells 2x as much. 
Kelly Bania: That's very helpful. And then, just wanted to ask another question on deflation in some of the categories. I think you mentioned that all departments still comped positive, even though you had some deflation in dairy and produce and maybe seafood for the quarter. So just curious how you manage that. Do you do some incremental promotions in those categories in order to drive volume and increase the comps there when you experience deflation? Or how do you manage that so stably? 
W. McMullen: Well, a lot of times, it depends on what's driving the deflation. In some categories, you have deflation when the product is at its peak and tastes great. If you look at -- like produce. Usually, if there's deflation, that means there's tons of product available, and it's really great product, so you end up selling more. In other areas, when you have deflation, you're able to give such a great value for the customer for the item. So you end up promoting it more and the volume grows. So it's -- we would drive our promotions based on what our insights tell us that customers like and at what point they like versus trying to just make sure we have every department positive. But fortunately, every department was positive identicals. And I know, Mike, you were looking up some of the specific numbers. 
J. Schlotman: No, it's -- I was just looking to -- when you look across the departments, the strength of whether you look at the -- just the IDs or the inflation-adjusted ID sales, it's really pretty remarkable how broad-based the strength of that -- of the momentum is in various departments. I mean, we even -- we had some departments that, even on an inflation-adjusted basis, were still double-digit IDs sales inside their department, and I'm excluding fuel and pharmacy from that. So it's -- at the end of the day, it's really fundamental that -- I spoke of it earlier, why we're so cognizant of what volume we're driving from a unit basis because that's, at the end of the day, what drives your business. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Just actually 2 kind of quick ones. Mike, I think you were alluding somewhat to the wage pressures. Can you kind of walk us through, is the wage pressures a lot more than normal for Kroger right now? And is that sort of a broader economic thing? And then, maybe tie into that some maybe more commentary on any changes you're seeing in your overall customer. HemisFares sounds like a more upscale, private-label launch. Are you seeing any change in the amount of trade-up going on? Or any changes in the different levels of your customers' behavior would be helpful. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, the comments I made earlier weren't directly related to any wage pressures. It was actually the -- our own decision, and Rodney mentioned it as well, of certain departments, where we invested some incremental hours in those departments to drive a better customer experience. And it also happens to be departments where some of our tonnage has been very strong as well. So those hours would have ultimately got -- been in the stores anyway, but it was in advance of that. The wage pressures, I would say, aren't really any different than what we spoke of in the first quarter. There continues to be some out there. We're cognizant of trying to deliver the right overall package to our associates from a solid wage, a good health care package and a retirement plan as well. And we're a little different than a lot of our competitors, where we're balancing all 3 of those for all of our associates. As it relates to HemisFares, I would put that in the category of the Private Selection and Simple Truth range, where it is more of an upscale product and a very high-quality product and it's -- but it does wind up having fairly broad appeal to a lot of folks. Because when you really step back and dissect a lot of customers, there are many customers who, on some items, are a budget shopper, on other items, they wind up splurging on particular items. And these can be the kinds of items those folks wind up splurging on, while in other departments, they're perfectly happy with an entry-level price point or a banner brand that's a lower price point for them. I would say that the HemisFares, as it develops, and Private Selection and Simple Truth, as that mix shifts towards those, it is actually one of the things that's helping to drive our mix to be a little bit different than it has been historically as well. 
W. McMullen: The thing that's hot so hard to tell -- I don't think it's so much economy-based as customers clearly want high-quality food. So if you look at the areas -- natural and organics, Boar's Head, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas all have strong, nice growth. So I really -- it really appears to be much different than just economy-based. When you talk to customers, they are definitely interested in saving money. There's no doubt about that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: I'll keep this to one question. Just wondering if you could talk about changes in the competitive promotional environment for both the overall business and the natural and organic part of the portfolio. Are you seeing anything different as the second quarter progressed and even third quarter-to-date? 
W. McMullen: Yes, as you know, when we look at competition, we always assume that competition is going to get more aggressive going forward than it's been in the past. And we always find that if that doesn't happen, then life's easier. It's just the way we've, years ago, learned to do our business plan. We wouldn't see anything that would be major in changes. There's always a certain promotion or some -- you'll see things that different customers -- competitors do. And you'll see it, even within weeks, changing. So there wasn't anything that I would say is a huge change in the second quarter versus first quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Certainly had a nice bounce to the fuel margins here in recent months. If some of this persists, though, would you anticipate reinvesting that back into the business? Or do you think that would -- you'd let that flow through to the bottom line? 
W. McMullen: It's obviously a good question. It's one where I don't think I would really be able to answer at this point, because it really depends on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that. So I -- at this point, I really wouldn't think it would be appropriate to answer it. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And then, just curious on your click-and-collect experience in those newer markets. Are the customers signing up for some of those longer-term fees like the monthly or annual fees? Or are they gravitating more to the pay-per-visit approach? 
W. McMullen: You actually have customers doing all 3. I would say, the most customers are on the 2 extremes. They do the yearly approach or the per-order approach. But it's not one of those things where you see 80% of the customers going one way or the other. 
Mark Wiltamuth: And can you tell if it's incremental in those new markets? 
W. McMullen: It's -- some of the basket would be incremental, but it's still so early that it's -- I -- the answer I gave you is what we're seeing, but I don't -- I wouldn't use a whole lot of basis off of it, because the sample size is still too small. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, it's a data point, not a trend. 
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Want to follow up on this volatility that you cited in the -- your product cost. First, on pharmacy inflation with generics, could you quantify or -- specifically or directionally how much that affected gross margin? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't talk about a direct effect on gross margin, but I will tell you that pharmacy inflation in the quarter continued to be above 9%. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And again, that wasn't passed through due to the contracts and so forth? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the -- you have contracts out there that you have to wait till you can pass it through. But also keep in mind, as generic inflation happens, we have the $4 30-day supply and $10 90-day supply, and we haven't changed those price points either. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay, that's helpful. And on -- when you talked about managing inflation and deflation, you had a good follow-up, I thought, on the pricing versus market share. So let me ask you about just on the inventory side. Does Kroger try to either go long -- commodities are inflating or be a little short those are -- that are deflating? Or is it -- when you talk about managing, is it much more about being sharp on pricing and managing it between -- using price to lever either market share or profitability? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, the -- we do, do some things for our -- for consumption in our own manufacturing plants when we look at supply of products and the supply chain that is out there. We don't go overboard on hedges, and we really don't use hedges so much. It would be cash purchase contracts to lock in a price for a period of time. But we typically don't get too excited about doing those things unless the current prices and projected prices are trending below a 5-year rolling average because it's -- if you talk to people in the oil industry today, oil is only going to do one thing, and that's go down. And when oil prices are going up and you talk to somebody in the oil industry, they're only going to do one thing, and that's go up forever. And I would say most people in the commodities world has -- have that view. So we're very careful about how we do it. The amount we consume is actually pretty large, so we try not to be -- I use the term a lot internally, I'd rather be approximately correct than precisely wrong. And if I made too big a bet one way or the other, I'd probably be precisely wrong. 
Andrew Wolf: Just a last thing, so that -- what you just described is only for the vertically integrated part of the business, manufacturing, it doesn't permeate to retail at all? Or does it? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, it -- so for example, I wouldn't go out, if I see something happening in produce, and try to hedge the apple crop this fall. Probably can't effectively do that anyway. But we do things with growers, trying to lock up fields and things like that, but that's more to make sure we have the exact product we want, not -- we do that regardless of the inflationary environment. 
Operator: And that last question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Brian Cullinane: This is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. Just wanted to talk broadly. Your business model is clearly unique and advantaged with the data technology that you guys have. Just wanted to touch on how you guys think about expanding and -- whether it's through square-footage growth and acquisitions or building more stores, getting your store and your offering to more consumers kind of in areas that you're not currently in. 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look in terms of going to territories that we are not in at all, as you know, historically, we've done that through mergers. And we're always, as Mike mentioned earlier, looking out for the right one to do something with. We're finding incredible opportunity on fill-ins, and we're -- the -- most of the incremental capital that Mike talked about is, what we're finding, is incremental project opportunities for great projects in existing markets. And right now, that's the highest focus. Now, that doesn't mean that we wouldn't go into a new territory de novo at some point. 
Brian Cullinane: Great. And any thoughts to -- you're spending more on capital, but to accelerate any of that with the success that you're having with some of the new stores and new projects? 
W. McMullen: Well, we feel like we already are, if you look at the incremental capital that we're spending, and we continue to push that. So you're always looking for opportunities to grow, but grow and make sure you execute, and we feel like we have started picking up that pace. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I prefer an environment where I have a bunch of division presidents upset with me that they have great projects that we haven't been able to fund because of our capital -- what they would call capital constraints, and spending $3.3 billion this year doesn't sound real constrained to me. So if they weren't clamoring for more dollars, I'd be nervous about our opportunities. But as long as they're clamoring, I feel good about where we are. 
W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11. I know that many on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to mourn those we lost on that horrific day and to honor their memory through our support for police, firefighters and other first responders as well as the military and their families. The 9/11 -- I recently had a chance to go to the 9/11 memorial and museum, and it's incredibly touching, and I'm sure most people on the call have. But if you haven't, it's well worth seeing, and it really does make you appreciate all the things that the police, firefighters and other first responders did on that morning.
 Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. One of the most exciting things about working for a growing and expanding company is the additional opportunities it creates for associates. Many of you would agree that Kroger is a place where you can come for a job and stay for a career. When I ask associates and managers why they stayed, most tell me they fell in love with working with people, our customers and associates, or they found a deep passion for food. Often, it's both. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 70% of our store managers started as hourly associates. I believe there are many young people working for us today who will become our future leaders and will be having Mike's role and other senior leaders' roles and mine. Our associates are people who care, who want to connect with something bigger and make a difference in our communities every day. We ask candidates to imagine you at Kroger, because whether you're looking for a flexible part-time job or for a lasting and rewarding career, you can find it here. And we're looking for friendly, bright people who want opportunities to learn and grow. This is such an exciting time to be at Kroger. Together, we do make a difference. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2015-06-18 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.
 A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. 
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2015 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Kroger delivered strong first quarter sales and earnings results, and we are pleased with our start for the year. We achieved our 46th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to invest and innovate to grow our business, expanding our use of technology and our digital capabilities. 
 Kroger has produced consistently remarkable results for so long that it might be easy to take a quarter like this for granted, but these results don't happen accidentally. They happen because we lead and drive our business toward these goals. Customer 1st and our 4 keys: our people, products, shopping experience and pricing, remains our fundamental strategy. We strive for balance across these 4 keys, and each quarter, we do a little better in each. And when we do that consistently for as long as we have, our results are more powerful. 
 Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are raising our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year, and we are on track to deliver our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in 2015. One of the ways we continuously improve the shopping experience is by bringing new technology and digital capabilities to our business. Mike Ellis will provide an update on several digital efforts in a moment, but I wanted to mention what I think is a great example of how we're expanding our use of technology. 
 Our recent decision to establish 84.51°, which replaced our previous joint venture, dunnhumbyUSA, 84.51° is helping us to continue to use data science for the benefit of our customers and to deliver a more personalized experience, both in store and online. We are so excited to welcome the talented associates at 84.51° to the Kroger team, and we are already beginning to see their daily involvement in the business helping to accelerate our efforts. 
 Just little things, like 84.51° CEO Stuart Aitken participating in our senior officer meetings is making a big difference. We expect 84.51° to be an innovation engine and a game changer for Kroger and our customers. We are pleased to see the economy moving in the right direction, albeit as we've mentioned for several quarters, slowly. 
 One of the important ways we are able to deliver so consistently is that we offer attractive values for all customers all the time. When you want to splurge, you can splurge. When you want to save, you can do that, too. So while Murray's Cheese, Starbucks and Boar's Head, for example, are performing very well, so are our entry-level price point brands. 
 Now I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thank you, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. Our associates continue to deliver an exceptional experience in ways that make a difference for our customers. Over the past year, more customers have noticed improvements in Kroger's product selection, product freshness and customer service. Our strong identical supermarket sales growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the first quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at even a faster rate than total household growth again in the quarter. 
 We're especially proud of our loyalty and sales results when you consider the current operating environment that we're in, which has less certainty than normal. We are addressing the volatility we see out there every day. Fuel margins, for example, have returned to normal compared to where we ended last year. 
 Another factor is product costs. Some commodities are up, some are down. We are seeing deflation in milk, produce and seafood, which is driving more tonnage volume. Milk is one of our most price-elastic categories that we have. When milk prices come down, people tend to buy a lot more. We're at an advantage because we have a vertically integrated supply chain for milk. When our dairy plants run at higher volume, we become more efficient and productive. 
 We continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals and in certain commodities in the meat department. Overall, inflation continued, but at a lower rate during the first quarter, which is in line with what we had expected. 
 Tonnage growth was very strong during the first quarter. In fact, we saw the strongest first quarter tonnage performance since 2010, which is a clear indication of our ability to get pricing right for our customers. If you look back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers. 
 Corporate Brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.9% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation, and as Rodney said, we are actively expanding Kroger's use of technology, which we see as a catalyst for improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. 
 Kroger's digital team has developed a popular mobile app that our customers use millions of times each week. In April, we were one of the first food retailers to release an app that is compatible with the Apple Watch. And this month, we reached a new milestone, more than 2 billion digital coupons have been downloaded from our digital properties since we began offering digital coupons in 2009. It took 4 years to reach our first billion and only 15 months to reach our second billion, and the third billion will take even less time. 
 Also this month, our Cincinnati division began inviting local customers to try our order online, pick up at the store solution we are learning from Harris Teeter, which we have been beta testing for a few months and is now available in 2 of our Cincinnati area stores to all customers. 
 Our integration with Vitacost.com continues to go very well, and just this week, Vitacost helped us launch a new natural and organic e-commerce website called King Soopers Live Naturally that is open to King Soopers customers who live in and around the Denver Metro area. The website, which utilizes Vitacost's technology platform and fulfillment network, creates an endless aisle experience with ship-to-home service for thousands of additional health foods, vitamins, minerals and supplements that are available in our Denver area stores today. We are excited to see the results of this new pilot program.
  And now I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Las Vegas and Louisville, and we agreed to a Master Agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Four of the 5 Teamster locals have also ratified this agreement. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus, Denver, Memphis and Portland. 
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. 
 Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business, and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. 
 Before I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to say a little more about the culture of opportunity we work hard to create here at Kroger. Being a Kroger associate means being part of our family, part of something bigger. Every day, we hire people who come to Kroger for a job, then decide to stay for a career. In fact, 2/3 of our store managers today started as an hourly clerk, stocking shelves or bagging groceries. We continue to increase our investment in training to build skills so our associates are ready for opportunities to advance and lead others. We offer so much more than a job, a chance to connect with their community, to be part of a giant team stretching from coast to coast and to work with colleagues who want to make a difference, too. We think this opportunity culture is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be into the future. 
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2015. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan. 
 Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 5.7%. This strong performance was supported by identical supermarket sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong identical supermarket sales growth. 
 Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 increased by 10 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. 
 Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.03%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the prior year first quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We do expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from the fiscal 2014 result. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth. 
 Now I'll share our first quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictability of fuel margins on our results. 
 Total sales in the first quarter increased 0.3% to $33.1 billion compared to $33 billion for the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6.4% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. 
 In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $619 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Kroger's net earnings during the first quarter last year included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help save -- stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effect of those charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings in the same period last year were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share. 
 We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the first quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year. We raised our annual estimate to $90 million from $75 million, primarily due to pharmacy inflation. 
 FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year. Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost control has allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. 
 Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, decreased 15 basis points as a result of sales compared to the prior year. This really does demonstrate the leverage of strong ID sales as we simultaneously invested in areas other than price to provide a continually improving shopping experience for our customers, but leveraged our ID sales to drive the rate down. 
 Now for retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.131 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. 
 Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 8 million common shares for a total investment of $585 million. 
 Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $915 million for the first quarter compared to $709 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. 
 Our planned increased capital investment on an annual basis remains in place. We are pleased with the early returns from these investments, and we continue to have a long list of strong projects that will compete for these investments. 
 The company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.09 compared to 2.40 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion consistent with last year. 
 It's constructive to understand that we have maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters and investing $3 billion in capital on a rolling 4-quarter basis, plus an additional $411 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. 
 In other words, we're keeping our commitments to our bondholders and our shareholders. Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2015. The original guidance was 3% to 4%. We're confirming our net earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share for 2015. This range is within our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. 
 As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe that quarter 2 will be slightly above the range, quarter 3 will be at the high end of the range and quarter 4 will be below the range. For the full year, we expect to be within the range, and it is still somewhat dependent on where fuel margins shake out. 
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. This is another terrific quarter. Our associates are making a difference for our customers by providing excellent service and product quality and selection. As I said earlier, results like this don't happen by accident. We create these results by connecting with our customers through our powerful Customer 1st Strategy. When we take care of our customers, we create sustainable value for our shareholders. 
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: So my first question, I guess, is just related to the guidance. So I guess, maybe more for Mike, but you obviously raised your ID guidance for the year. You had a good, strong quarter but you maintained the EPS guidance. So I'm just kind of curious, at this point, is it just early and you want to be conservative? Or are there other incremental offsets that are maybe new? 
J. Schlotman: It's a variety of factors, Ed, and one, it is early in the year. And as we said in both the release and in the prepared comments, the operating environment's a bit volatile right now. There's a lot of volatility in fuel prices. They've obviously come in very quickly to a more normal range from where the range was at the end of the year last year. We know that will be a headwind in the fourth quarter. It was baked into our original 8% to 11%. Our actual first quarter results, while ahead of The Street, were just a little bit over the 8% to 11% range, and we had expected to be the near the high end of the range ourselves, which was our original guidance on cadence. And then just the volatility of inflation that's out there. While we've seen some categories with deflation, we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it's been over the last several years. In the first quarter, it's right at double digits. And then a little bit of concern or thought process about the avian virus with the poultry flocks and how that might affect input costs later in the year and what's going to happen with availability of those products. So when we stepped back and thought about it, while we're pleased with the first quarter, we thought the most prudent move given the uncertainty -- or the volatility of some of the things out there was to maintain our guidance range. We had guided in March that if fuel margins came in, it may put us at the low end. We aren't saying we're going to be at the low end, but we're maintaining the range because that actually has happened with fuel. 
Edward Kelly: And Mike, historically, you've kind of said about $0.14 or so a gallon in fuel. Obviously, this quarter's lower, but kind of like the slope of the curve was rising. Is there anything else that's changed in the marketplace or maybe it's become a bit more competitive, where you're a little concerned about the $0.14? 
J. Schlotman: I -- we -- I wouldn't say we've focused on any one number. Our practice on fuel is to follow the market, and then give our most loyal customers a really good value on fuel by the -- our fuel rewards program, which I'll remind everybody the cost of that reduces our ID sales, it doesn't reduce the fuel margin. And it's really just what's happening in the marketplace as we follow the marketplace and stay right on The Street price and the signs but then give that incremental reward. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the first quarter. Any short period of time in fuel is an interesting result but a longer period of time is what's more important. 
W. McMullen: And we -- internally, we usually use a rolling 4-quarter number. This year, we didn't just because of how strong fuel margins were in the third and fourth quarter. And as Mike mentioned, on a daily basis, we're probably never right, but usually over the year, it gets pretty close. 
Operator: The next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just wanted to follow up a little more just on inflation. For this upcoming year, have you guys changed your inflation forecast? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we're still expecting it to be in the 1% to 2% range. We're actually at the high end of that range in the first quarter, a lot of that driven by the pharmaceutical inflation that Mike mentioned -- or we mentioned in the prepared comments, primarily in the generic arena. So that's out there. We do expect to see some potential inflation out there in the poultry flocks as the avian flu issue hits. We don't know what's going to happen with all of the input ingredients that go into products from liquid eggs and how that might affect a lot of products that contain that as an ingredient. So we think that 1% to 2% is right. So far, that's what we're seeing. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay, thanks for the color. And then switching topics, maybe to your competition. We hear a lot about capacity growth in the specialty grocery arena and even some -- even I guess, more commentary out there on the hard discount channel. What are you seeing right now from competitor openings in, I guess, from a full-service grocery perspective? 
W. McMullen: Well, from a full service, I guess, I would say it's probably been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. Not -- certainly not aggressive. Certainly, if you look at the niche merchants, there would be much higher growth there, but we consider everybody a competitor. So we don't -- we wouldn't segment it as different as what probably most people would think we would. 
Operator: The next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: So I'm just curious on, well, maybe this is just semantics, Mike, and maybe I'm overreading, but just to clarify on your guidance by quarter, you said just now that 3Q, you expect it to be at the high end of your guidance? I think last quarter you said it would be slightly above? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, if you look at second and third quarter, actually I think second quarter we said at high end and third quarter above. We just flip flopped those a little bit. It takes $8 million flipping between quarters to do that, and it's just our best thinking today. So it doesn't affect the year. I think if you look back to what we just said in March, the guidance on those 2 quarters just flipped between quarters. We still expect a very strong year. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then on tonnage, I don't know if you guys would be willing to give an actual percent tonnage number. And then, I guess, following on that, I guess, when I look at O&A, your O&A growth rate definitely seemed higher than what I would have expected. I know in the past, we -- you talked about tonnage impacting that number, but maybe just some color on those 2. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, relative to tonnage, we won't give an actual number. As Mike said in his prepared comments, it was the strongest we've had since 2010, and we haven't given a specific number, but we're very pleased with where it is. If you think about in the comments I made on OG&A, we're very pleased with the leverage we've got of 15 basis point reduction in that as a rate of sales. We did make conscious decisions to invest in other keys of our 4 key strategy versus price to provide a better shopping experience to our customers, both through making sure the products are on the shelves in a timely basis, having our associates friendly and we keep our products as fresh as possible. So there was some conscious decision to invest in incremental services for our customers, which provides more jobs and hours for our associates as well. 
W. McMullen: The other thing on tonnage, we always try to give an outline of where we are and how it feels, but it's very hard to calculate. And when a customer buys a 24 unit of something versus a 12 unit of something in our -- internally, we count that as one and one. 
J. Schlotman: Or water, the common package for bottled water today is 32 bottles. It used to be 24. That's still a unit. 
W. McMullen: It's not that we're trying to avoid the question. It's just that it's -- there's an awful lot of assumptions behind that, and what we try to do is give everybody a general feel for what's going on. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then just on the ClickList, I guess, in Cincinnati. I mean, obviously I know you guys are always very conservative and want to make sure your customer is getting the best experience, but it definitely seemed like it was a pretty long test phase. So I guess, maybe can you maybe clarify or give some color on what you ironed out, and what made you feel comfortable to roll it out now, and how quickly you think you could accelerate that? 
W. McMullen: Yes, the length of the test would seem long just because it became public a lot faster than we had intended to because somehow, one of the newspaper folks that follow us found the actual website that we were testing with our associates. So it's not that it was longer than normal. It's just that it was public longer than what we normally would. It's tracking -- if you look at our original plan, we're tracking on exactly where we thought we would be on the original plan, and feel good about it. And then Mike just pointed out to me, we just added our second store, I guess it was this week or last week. 
J. Schlotman: And again that's in a beta test and you kind of have to know it's there. It's a new experience for us, and we just want to make sure it's right. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: I wanted to ask you first about really the private label, in particular the Simple Truth, if you could just give us a quick update in terms of where that brand is today? If over the first quarter there had been any updates in terms of product expansion and how big that particular segment is for you right now. 
Michael Ellis: The brand, we're very pleased with. I think you'll find around 2,600 SKUs in our stores today and talk about connecting with the customer in a meaningful way. They have taken the brand and really embraced the brand. For us, it's been not only strategic, but it's really lining up with what customers are looking for today. And you can also buy it now on Vitacost.com. And it's available there also, so anybody who -- even if you don't shop in a Kroger market, you're able to get the product today. But no, we've been totally -- completely pleased with the progress we're making, and there are many more new items to come. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, sticking with the natural segment, as you're continuing to learn the Vitacost division and as you're -- as you mentioned, you have the Soopers site now up, have you had any further progress? I know it's still admittedly pretty early, but have you had any further progress that you could share with us in terms of maybe bringing some more of those products that had historically been Vitacost into some of your other banners? 
Michael Ellis: Well, today, we have a pretty good selection of natural foods, supplements, body building products, health care products in our stores. Vitacost really just helps us fulfill that long tail of items that are smaller in some cases, and on the King Soopers website now, you can pick up 25,000 to 30,000 additional SKUs than what you'd find in a typical Kroger store. So it's really helped us take natural foods, natural products to the customer in a much broader way. We're really pleased with where we're headed. There's a lot of work still to do. We're approaching our first anniversary with Vitacost next month, and so we're actually moving pretty fast as a company and we're pleased with where we're headed. 
Operator: The next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Rodney, I want to start with -- you put up a quarter like this, but I know you guys can be somewhat self-critical. When you step back and say, from a skill set standpoint or a business line standpoint, where are you still not where you want to be in a significant way, not we're 90% of the way there but we have a lot of work to do? And then as part of that, address maybe the issue of speed to market and that being a more important skill set to work on over the next couple of years. 
W. McMullen: The shortest hard question to answer, and when I did my own performance review with our Board, somebody asked the same question. And you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you realize when you look at our culture overall, we're always very proud of what we've accomplished. But at the same time, we feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to get better, and a lot of times, we like to use the words that our to-do list is longer than our done list. And when you look at what's out in front of us, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we see to continue to get better. And the hardest thing that we have to do is actually make sure that we're trying not to improve on all things at once, but what are the things that are most important to the customer and put all our resources against that. So I guess that the way I would say overall is obviously, we're delighted with the quarter, delighted with the progress we're making. We're even more excited about the opportunity to continue to get better. So I feel very good about where we are, but I feel even better about the opportunities we have in front of us. 
John Heinbockel: But are there certain -- there have to be, right, certain product categories -- I don't want to get into geographic differences, but certain product categories, businesses, customer groups that you're not fully resonating with yet, it'd have to be those, and what would tie those together, if anything? 
W. McMullen: It's -- probably I'm trying to think of the easiest way to answer your question because it's a very good question. The -- it's more opportunity. So if you think about like apparel, where you just -- we've added apparel to, I don't know, I think we're up to 70-some marketplace stores. We're still learning what is the right selection of product to have that's in a marketplace store. Obviously, the Fred Meyer Group helps us get insight and procures the product for us through that channel, but we're still learning what's the right things to put in. And there's a ton of those kind of things going on, so it's really hard to say we're -- there's one specific item or one specific customer. It's much broader than that, and it's 100 different things versus just one thing that we're really trying to get better at. 
John Heinbockel: All right. And then just lastly, when you think about pricing, right, and pricing being a journey, it looks to me like, whether it's traditional competitors or mass, there's been some stabilization with regard to pricing, right? It's not a race to the bottom. Is that fair? And at this point, you're largely where you need to be. And the adjustments to come, is it -- do you think it's more kind of rifle -- you sort of look at maybe the hard discounters and work to be done on private label pricing, but are we stable and largely there and it's just selective guys you've got to address at this point? 
W. McMullen: If you look at longer term on pricing, as you know, over the last several years, we've invested in price as we reduced OG&A to take costs out of the business. The last few quarters, we have been a little more aggressive in investing in service. So it's not just price based. So if you look at the mix of where we invest, we have invested some of that cost reduction in additional service hours and things like that. So it's a journey that you never arrive at a destination, so you're continually making progress, and you continually change based on your competitive -- your competitors change as well. So we're happy where we are, but we are continuing to invest but it's really driven by as we get costs out of the business. I don't know if, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. It's right in sync with the prepared comments we had. And I'll just throw in, when you think about our 4 keys, we're constantly asking ourselves what do we invest in to make sure that we're offering the best balance to the customer based on what the customer wants and the retail environment that we're in. So Rodney's point about investing more in our people in the last few quarters is right on. 
Operator: The next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: One question would just be, real quickly, you talked about where your guidance for inflation was for the year but did you comment on what you thought inflation was for the quarter? 
W. McMullen: We did not. But Mike... 
J. Schlotman: We're at the high end of that range, primarily driven by Pharmacy. It's about 1/8. If you look at it without Pharmacy, it would have been lower, and the comments we had on a volatile operating environment is -- if you just get rid of the headline news on inflation and you start to dig into the commodities, you have things going all over the world. And one of the things I think we're most proud of this quarter is there were so many things bouncing around, and our ability to manage through that this quarter really showed up in our results. 
Meredith Adler: Great. And then I was wondering if you would talk at all about the formats that you're testing called Ruler. I think you maybe have about 30 stores, and I was just wondering what your thoughts are. And we do know that Aldi is going to be opening more stores in Southern California is getting a big push, and Lidl is also going to be coming to the U.S. pretty soon, just how do you feel about that format? And do you want to be a competitor in that format? 
W. McMullen: We're still -- it's still very early and it's obviously a test for us. It's one of the things where we feel good about the progress the team made. The format actually came to us through one of our mergers. When we merged with Jay C, they had the format even back then, and the team has made a lot of changes to what's inside of it, and we continue to make changes. I wouldn't say that we're ready for prime time yet, but we are making progress in the right direction. And it really ties back to when you look at -- you've heard us over the years talk a lot about how customers are bifurcating, and we want to make sure that we have a format that serves all customers, and there's certain customers that living on a budget is really important because either they want to or they have to, and it's operating a store as efficient as you can to give the best prices you can. So it really ties to that. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? 
Michael Ellis: Just what we learned from this type of a format has really been helpful to better understand that value segment and how to operate in that value world. So we've really, as a company, learned a lot, I think. 
Meredith Adler: Great. And then just real quickly, I know you said your natural organic department was up double digits. Did you see any changes at all? I think there are some other retailers that have said there was a bit of a slowdown, I think primarily in the dry grocery side, but I don't know, it doesn't sound like you saw anything, but did you? 
W. McMullen: Nothing that I can put my finger on. It's still real healthy for us. Again, we have good supplies, so we haven't had any issues around that. But no, customers still are as interested in the natural category, the natural foods world, real food, we call it, as they ever have been. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: I wanted to follow up on your thinking around the guidance. I think you said the quarter came in slightly above, with fuel, slightly below. So how does that, if we just isolate the stores, does that mean the stores was little better than that versus internal expectations? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I think the strong IDs without fuel would demonstrate how happy we are with our core grocery performance, and our -- that's built into our expectations for the year when we raised ID sales guidance without fuel. So we're very pleased with what's going on inside the 4 walls of the store. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And Meredith asked about the, I guess, the cadence on natural, but I'd like to ask about it just on a -- across the store. It sounds like, from your answer and the answer on natural, that there hasn't been a big fall off or some volatility on the consumer side. I think it sounds to me like the worry is more on the supply side, whether it's the fuel margins coming in or what's going to happen with some of the commodities. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question on the supply side, Andrew. 
Andrew Wolf: Well, first of all, I want to ask if you're seeing any change in your sales cadence, and is that where you're seeing volatility? Or is it just in the other things you mentioned such as fuel margins and potential disruptions or whatever you're thinking about with avian flu? 
W. McMullen: Yes, I'll answer part of it. I'll let Mike or Mike answer the other part. If you look at the change, during the quarter would be more driven by inflation, clearly is a little -- ended the quarter slower than it started out in the quarter. So the change has been more inflation-driven. Tonnage has been pretty consistent -- or was pretty consistent. If you look at this quarter, quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of the range that we gave for the balance of the year. And part of the reason for that is we expect inflation to continue to get lower as we go through the year. In terms of the avian flu and some of the other pieces, Mike or Mike? 
J. Schlotman: When we just -- Andy, when we sat back and looked at all the factors out there and the fact that even though it's -- even though on a calendar, we're almost halfway through the year, but for Kroger, we're only a quarter of the way through the year, we just thought it was very early to change our EPS guidance for the year given the volatility in a lot of commodities inside inflation, giving -- given what could be an unknown effect of the avian virus as we go throughout the year, volatility in fuel. Again, we're very happy with where we are and we think given the 8% to 11% growth rate off of a very strong last year, being able to deliver in that range and continue to produce the results on the cadence we projected we think will result in a very fine year. 
Operator: The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I'm not sure if you answered this yet. If you did, forgive me, but in terms of ID sales into 2Q, how are they progressing quarter-to-date, even if just on a qualitative basis? And are there any timing issues, any items we should be aware of as we model that near-term top line? 
W. McMullen: Ken, as I just mentioned, if you look at the identicals so far this quarter, we continue to be a little ahead of the range guidance we gave for the year. Part of that is driven because we believe inflation will continue to decline during the year, and we would still expect that based on what we're seeing today when you look at the impact on identicals. 
Kenneth Goldman: I did miss it when you just said it. I apologize. Broader question, we've seen quite a sudden market share shift in food retail in general away from sort of specialty channels back toward, for lack of a better term, the Krogers of the world, more traditional, I know you don't love that term, but more traditional grocers. I think the general thesis out there, which I agree with, is that much of the shift is generated by you and some peers adding natural and organic products, but it seems like better for you isn't quite big enough to move the needle as much as what we've seen. So are there any other drivers that you are seeing out there that would sort of explain this kind of quick shift in consumer behavior? Or is it just too vague and too hard to tell? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm not sure. I guess, I'll speak for myself a little bit here. I'm not sure I 100% agree with your thesis. When you look at some of the specialty retailers, just because some of them have reported lower ID sales than what their trend has been, they continue to open stores. They have a little bit of cannibalization, and a lot of them continue to post ID sales above what the market would be growing at. So I wouldn't subscribe to the theory that there's necessarily a sudden shift in market share away from them. It may be a slower growth in market share gain, but I wouldn't say it's a shift away from them. We actually -- we can't ask our customers where did you shop before. When they -- when our IDs go up 5.1%, we believe we're taking share and more sales dollars from our customers from a wide variety of retailers and are happy to do that, and that's really what we focus on. But I think our sales strength comes from a broad base of folks, including doing a better job of offering new and unique products that they may not be able to get somewhere else, like Simple Truth. But I think -- I wouldn't -- if I were sitting in their chairs, I wouldn't necessarily be embarrassed by some of the recent results they've had. 
W. McMullen: And I will answer your question a little different than how Mike did. If you look at the Fresh side of our business, produce, meat and some of those departments, deli, we're having incredibly strong growth. Some of that is improving freshness. Some of it is that customers wanting to eat products that's fresher. And that is something that we have a huge competitive advantage versus a lot of our competitors because the variety that we offer, we offer it all, plus we do still have some -- there are certain products you just can't get an organic item or a natural item. So we're able to make your full shop with us. So it's really a position of strength for us and an opportunity for us to continue to deliver. 
Operator: And our next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: There's been quite a few questions about competitive environment, but I'll tack on another one. Are you seeing anything different in the promotional environment as the quarter progressed, or even over the last month? 
Michael Ellis: Well, we probably have seen different competitive pockets of activity around the country, but that's not unusual. But as a company, we just tend to deal with that as things change and as our customers -- try to meet our customers' needs in the most beneficial way to them. But there's nothing really specific that I can put my finger on, but again, there is promotional activity. But when you have as broad a geography as we have, you see just about everything throughout the course of time. So yes, nothing I can really put my finger on. 
Alvin Concepcion: I guess, maybe more specifically, are you seeing anything different on the margin environment for your natural and organic food part of the portfolio? 
Michael Ellis: Nothing that I would say is worth reporting, but -- most of what we see today is just this mainstreaming of natural and organics continues, but I wouldn't say there's additional retail pressure on those categories, I guess. 
Alvin Concepcion: Great. And one more quick one for me, you talked a little bit about the growth in loyal households. Wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast that growth was and what kind of share of wallet you're getting now from those loyal customers? 
Michael Ellis: Well, we -- I can say we're pleased with transactions, and number of households and visits per household and spend per customer. So in general, it's very healthy for us right now. I really don't want to get too specific about any of the numbers, but overall, it's been a combination of those factors that have been driving our ID sales. 
Operator: The next question comes from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi. 
Filippe Goossens: Typically, you don't comment obviously on M&A activity, but I was wondering if you perhaps could opine a little bit on if there were to be a merger between Ahold and Delhaize, whether that would at all impact your competitive position in those markets where you do overlap with the 2 companies. 
W. McMullen: The -- you're correct when you say we don't comment on mergers. So I won't talk about the particular specifics on the one you asked about. But any time companies merge, it creates certain opportunities and you try to make sure that you deal with the opportunities that are created, and different ones create different kinds of opportunities. And it really is you sit down and say what is the right strategy for this particular one? So -- and we wouldn't look at, if the 2 of them merge, any different than whenever somebody else merges. And we believe there'll be continued consolidation in our industry and we have every intentions of being a consolidator in that consolidation of the industry. And as you know, we've participated in several mergers over the last year and the last several years. 
Filippe Goossens: Okay. And then if I perhaps may ask a derivative question. Obviously you've seen the news of CVS and Target working together right now for the operation of the pharmacy stores within the Target locations. I presume that Kroger remains fully committed to operating the respective pharmacy locations you have within your different formats yourselves going forward? 
W. McMullen: Well, we love the pharmacy business and the whole offer that it offers for the customer, and we continue to see strength -- strong results there. One of the things that if you look at the average volume per location and some of that, we would have very, very strong performance on a per location basis and continue to do very well and grow. So we're... 
Operator: And next we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So Rodney kind of teed this up because you said you see yourself as a consolidator in the business and so I know, Mike, I think you said your leverage is 2.09. Thinking about your balance sheet, what is your capacity to do further transactions? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I think the answer to that question isn't what my financial capacity is, it's what's the capacity of the organization to do something, it's what assets might be available, and do they fit the metrics that we typically would go after when you would look at a transaction. So we wouldn't sit back and say, oh, Harris Teeter's behind us. We've delevered. Let's go spend another $2.5 billion, get it back up to 2.4 and work our way back down. It's really quite the opposite. It's one of the reasons we try to maintain the ratio where it is if an opportunity does come up, can we take on the leverage of that correct unique opportunity, act on it, have the rating agencies continue to have the believability in us doing what we say, and that is we told them 18 to 24 months we'd get our leverage back down. It took 12, and it went down again this year. And I think the statistics we went through with the return of capital to shareholders as well as what we've invested back in the business, all told, when you add that up, it's about $4.5 billion we either returned or invested. And to maintain debt at a flat level really demonstrates the power of the cash that we can generate as a company. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. Second question is, and I know we touched on some of the natural and organic guys and other things just, but I was just kind of broadly looking at the space, you guys commented tonnage growth has accelerated. It seems to me that your market share gains are accelerating. Why, I guess? What's changing? Why is more market share accreting to Kroger at an accelerating rate? And is -- does your outlook -- forget gas and inflation, but just basically is the outlook over the next 12 to 24 months that this pattern is going to continue? 
W. McMullen: For us, the progress that we've made overall, we really would give our hats off to our associates. It's our associates interacting one-on-one every time and helping make the customers' experience a little bit better is what's driving the results, and it's our ability to support our associates to deliver great service. So it's -- I don't know that there's a big magic wand that we're waving. It really is 100 small things but doing each one of those things a little bit better and our associates continue to improve our execution and giving us feedback so we can keep getting better. And then using the insights we have working with 84.51° and then now going forward, we'll be able to work with others broader than just 84.51°. So it's all of those things together that's supporting that. 
Scott Mushkin: Right. And if I could have one more. Publix continues to encroach. How do you stop that, and what do you think about that? 
W. McMullen: Well, we would say about Publix the way we would say about tons of competitors, Walmart, Costco and on and on and on. They're a great competitor. We always learn a lot from them because they do a great job running their stores, and we don't look at so much in terms of how do you stop a specific competitor. We're really focused on how do we make sure we keep getting better, and if they're successful in a market, they're successful at somebody else's expense, not us. 
Operator: And that question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about 84.51°. I thought it was interesting that you -- I think Rodney characterized it as a game changer, and I understand that you'll -- the new structure allows you to work with outside data service providers in conjunction with 84.51°, but just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what are some of the priorities in terms of how you would like to expand the use of that business for Kroger. 
W. McMullen: Yes, the -- how do I answer your question without our competitors understanding exactly what we're trying to do? The -- I can tell you I've had more dialogue, and several of us have, in terms of how do we better use the data we have for the benefit of our customers and to run our business better. And we've had more of those discussions in the last 8 weeks than we had in the 2 years before that because we spent an awful lot of time talking about things other than Kroger. So to us, there -- and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are a lot of great people at 84.51° that we're just so excited for them to be part of our family, and I know they're so excited because they're going to be able to even help us accelerate what we're doing. So it's really hard to say specifics other than I can tell you we have a huge list of things that we can use our data for, for the benefit of our customers and running our business better that would, for whatever reason, we hadn't taken advantage of. And we're going to figure out a way to prioritize that and figure out a way to take advantage of that, and some of those cases will involve partnering with other companies other than just 84.51°. 
Kelly Bania: That's helpful, and any comments on what's the strategy? Or is there a strategy to grow the 84.51° business with other retailers or clients like Kroger, so the company can grow its own profitability and growth? 
W. McMullen: Yes, we really won't comment on that at this point.
  Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. We recently wrapped up our Red, White and Barbecue celebration in stores across our company. Special thanks to each of you for making this exciting event possible, and I can tell you I personally ate way too much on the samples. Our customers loved kicking off the summer grilling season with fresh flavors and fun ideas to share with their family and friends. I also want to thank you for helping show Kroger's gratitude to our active duty troops and our nation's 23 million veterans this summer. Through our partnership with the USO and the Honoring Our Heroes campaign, we hope to raise an additional $2 million for our military men and women. Together, Kroger's associates and customers have raised more than $11.9 million since 2010 to support USO programs. This represents the largest gift to the USO in its history. Visit the Honoring our Heroes website for more information about how you can help. We also continue to hire our heroes. More than 29,000 veterans have joined our team since 2009, including more than 6,000 associates last year. Thank you for helping welcome them to our Kroger family. 
 That completes our call today, and thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-03-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our fourth quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks on this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
 With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 2014 was an outstanding year for Kroger. First, let me say how proud I am to work with such a great and outstanding team of associates. Each of them deserve a round of applause for improving our connection with all customers and growing our core business right in line with our growth strategy.
 Second, I am pleased to report that we kept our commitments to you, our shareholders. As you know, the growth plan we first outlined in October of 2012 includes 4 key performance indicators: positive identical supermarket sales growth, slightly expanding nonfuel FIFO operating margin, growing return on invested capital and annual market share growth. In 2014, we met or exceeded each of these metrics. At the end of the year, we achieved an industry-leading 45th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We improved return on invested capital even as we increased capital investment. And we captured incremental market share for the 10th consecutive year.
 Strong performance means strong shareholder returns. We exceeded our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% in fiscal 2014, and we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year since we reinstated our dividend. Because we've been delivering at this level -- higher level of performance consistently and for so long, it can start to look easy or be taken for granted. It is important to know that our associates are committed to our continued success today and for the future.
 We made progress on the other key elements of our growth strategy as well. We're innovating to grow. We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives the customer, our customers, the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our corporate brand team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organic brand, Simple Truth, hit $1 billion in annual sales for the first time and in less than 2 years after the introduction. We are investing to grow in both new and existing markets. We continue to pursue our fill-in strategy and are making great progress. Our mergers with Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com have opened new markets that present meaningful growth opportunities for Kroger.
 We continue to create jobs. Today, we proudly employ nearly 25,000 more associates than we did last year at this time. Every day, we are creating opportunities for both new and current associates.
 Our strong across-the-board results during fiscal 2014 allowed us to make a strategic and significant contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation this year. We use our foundation dollars to support causes that our customers consistently tell us they care about, that enhances our reputation as a locally connected retailer. We are very proud that Forbes magazine previously recognized our work by naming us the most generous company in America. This contribution will allow Kroger to continue to support our key priorities, including hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families and local community organizations. We are proud to make this investment to continue our efforts to support our customers and the communities that support our growth.
 Kroger customers are increasingly positive about the economy since late last year through the new year. They are feeling more comfortable with their discretionary spending, in part due to the low retail price of fuel. Even so, how our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their families' finances. Customers' perception of the economic recovery are still very much divided, and yet we continue to deepen loyalty with all of our customers. That is because whatever the external factors are at play at a given time, be it inflation in certain commodities, fluctuating fuel prices or unemployment, we adjust to win with the customer. So while inflation affected fuel costs through 2014, our personalized offers, weekly promotions and price investments helped customers stretch their dollars. We are currently investing $3.5 billion annually in lower prices. Even though natural and organic foods have been notoriously out of reach for many customers, we used our merchandising expertise, manufacturing base and buying power to make them affordable and accessible to all customers through Simple Truth, which continues to see double-digit sales growth. And while customers will always have evolving expectations for convenience, we have improved our prepared food offering to meet their changing needs as well.
 Like a great meal, there is no single characteristic that makes Kroger great. Rather, it is the sum of its parts. It is the combination of food and drink, people and atmosphere, surprise and delight that makes a great meal great. And it is that combination of factors that our associates bring together, the sum of our parts, that explains why Kroger is so successful.
 Before I turn it over to Mike Ellis, I wanted to let you know that both the Harris Teeter and Vitacost mergers are going very well, thanks to the incredible people at both companies. Mike will have more to say about these and our operational performance. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone.
 This was a great quarter capping off a really great year. Our associates make everything happen, and they knocked it out of the park this year on several fronts. We achieved an outstanding fourth quarter ID sales growth, without fuel, of 6%. As Rodney pointed out in our press release this morning, while improved fuel margins contributed significantly to our reported results in the second half of the year, our operating performance without fuel shows that our associates are continuing to deepen our relationship with customers in very meaningful ways. The better our connection with customers, the better our shareholder returns.
 Our identical sales performance was supported by robust performance in every department in every supermarket division. Natural foods, meat, deli and pharmacy departments all posted double-digit identical sales growth. For the 10th year in a row, we lowered costs and reinvested those savings to improve our store experience. It's no surprise that Kroger captured more share of the massive food market also for the 10th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report on market share annually and look at it as the customers would look at it, where they spend their money. Last year, we began using Nielsen point-of-sale plus, a Kroger term for Nielsen data that includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy.
 The data is generated by retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes all major food, drug, mass and dollar competitors, as well as most club competitors. It does not include C-stores. Nielsen POS plus captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including EPC-coded items, PLU and random-weight items, making it a really good and consistent source.
 According to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2014. This data also indicates that our share increased in 18 of the 20 markets outlined by the Nielsen report and was down slightly in just 2 markets. Walmart is one of our top competitors in 15 of the 20 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased in all of those markets.
 In addition to market share growth, we regularly measure our loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. Customers are buying fewer units per basket but visiting our stores more frequently. This is consistent with the trend for the past several quarters.
 Inflation continued in pharmacy and among commodities such as meat during the fourth quarter. We estimate product inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect the strong tonnage growth that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue.
 We've talked a lot this year about our Corporate Brands growth and success. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with Corporate Brands representing 28.2% of total units sold, the highest level in at least 7 years; and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. The star, of course, has been Simple Truth, and in 2014, Simple Truth reached an amazing milestone by hitting a $1.2 billion annual sales mark. Simple Truth has been our most successful brand launch ever, reaching billion-dollar-brand status in less than 2 short years. During the year, more than 20 million households bought 1 or more of our 2,688 Simple Truth or Simple Truth Organic items. The brand continues to earn double-digit unit and sales growth, which we don't see ending anytime soon.
 Shifting gears. We just completed our first year since merging with Harris Teeter, and our integration efforts have been fantastic. We are creating synergies both ways and we are learning new ways to connect with our customers. The Harris Teeter team is great, and both they and our general office teams have done an outstanding job in working together. Also, we are 6 months into the Vitacost merger, and our integration is going well. We continue to discover new ways to use Vitacost as a strategic advantage. We already have a strong national foods business, and Vitacost is helping us get better in that category. A cornerstone of our ability to deliver successful mergers is partnering with businesses that share our cultures and values. This makes it easy to share ideas between each other. Harris Teeter and Vitacost both illustrate that point.
 Finally, I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. We are currently negotiating in Louisville and with the Teamsters, covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. During 2015, we will also negotiate agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus; Denver; Las Vegas; Memphis; and Portland, Oregon. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continued to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We have very positive momentum with our customers, associates and communities as we move into 2015.
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results as well as our guidance for 2015. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone.
 Before I share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, there are a few things to keep in mind about fiscal 2014. There are 2 items that we are adjusting our full year results for: charges incurred in the first quarter related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits and certain tax benefits that we enjoyed in the third quarter. A lot of other things happened throughout the year as well, including low retail fuel prices and unusually high fuel margins, a LIFO charge that was significantly higher in 2014 than 2013, a $55 million contribution to our UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter. And as Rodney mentioned, we contributed $85 million to the company's charitable foundation throughout the year, $60 million of which was in the fourth quarter.
 Now I'll share our fourth quarter results. Please note that Kroger's operating results include Harris Teeter in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2014 but not the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013, which affects many year-over-year comparisons.
 Total sales in the fourth quarter were $25.2 billion, an increase of 8.5%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 14.2%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $518 million or $1.04 per diluted share. We recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $10 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin was comparable to the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations.
 Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the same period last year.
 Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2014 results, I'll share some data on our fuel operations, which includes our supermarket fuel and C-store business. In the fourth quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.234 compared to $0.113 in the same quarter last year. For the full year, the cents-per-gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.19 compared to $0.141 last year. Going forward, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages.
 Turning now to Kroger's full year results for 2014.
 Kroger reported total sales of $108.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 10.3%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 12.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 5.2% in 2014 compared with the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.73 billion or $3.44 per diluted share. Excluding the 2014 adjustment items, net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.77 billion or $3.52 per diluted share.
 It is important to note that if you look at adjusted EPS excluding fuel, it was at the high end of our long-term growth rate, even with the contributions to the pension and foundation included. So while fuel margins get a lot of attention, our nonfuel business had a spectacular year.
 Kroger's LIFO charge for 2014 was $147 million, significantly higher than 2013 due to higher product costs. FIFO gross margin for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 3 basis points. As Mike said, strong identical supermarket sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to reduce operating expenses as a rate of sales for our 10th consecutive year. Total operating expenses for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 13 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. FIFO operating margin for 2014, excluding those same items, increased 10 basis points compared with the prior fiscal year.
 Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for fiscal 2014 of 13.74% compared with 13.3 -- compared with 13.43% for fiscal 2013.
 For 2015, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, fund the dividend and increase capital investments. In connection with our merger with Harris Teeter, we committed to getting back to a 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid- to late fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our objective earlier than anticipated due to strong fiscal 2014 operating results. As of the close of the fourth quarter, net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.15x compared to 2.43x during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of the press release. Based on our current 2015 expectations, we should maintain a ratio below the 2.2x target throughout the year.
 Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $2.8 billion for the year compared to $2.3 billion in 2013. For 2015, we expect capital investments to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range.
 As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. New store openings are meeting our expectations. We have a great pipeline of high-quality projects that we expect to allow this result to continue. We will allocate more of the spend to increase square footage in our fill-in markets. We have now identified 8 markets for fill-in opportunities. This is up from 6. Our excitement for this activity continues to grow.
 Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the year, Kroger repurchased 28.4 million common shares for a total investment of $1.3 billion. As of February 27, 2015, Kroger has approximately $432 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase authority granted in June of 2014.
 Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for 2015.
 We anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2015. This range takes into account several factors: it's early in the year, our outlook for inflation is lower than actual inflation last year, and we expect our strong trend in unit growth to continue in 2015.
 Full year net earnings for fiscal 2015 are expected to range from $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. This equates to Kroger's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 11 -- of 8% to 11%, growing off of 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time.
 As we think about the growth in 2015, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages. We are not planning for similar contributions to the pension or foundation, and we expect LIFO to be lower than it was in 2014. We are anticipating inflation, without fuel, of 1% to 2%, and the actual amount will be driven primarily by inflation in meat and pharmacy. So while fuel margins will be a headwind in 2015, we expect they will be offset by a lower LIFO charge, no planned contributions to the pension plan and our foundation and the continued strength in our core business.
 For the full year, our expectation is that we will be in the middle portion of the range. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe quarter 1 will be in the range, quarters 2 and 3 will be slightly above the range and quarter 4 will be below the range as we -- and as we expect Kroger's full year operating profit margin in 2015, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2014 results.
 Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.
 I am so proud of our team. We fulfilled our commitments to our customers, associates, shareholders and bondholders in 2014.
 Kroger captured more share of the massive food market and continued to invest in growing our business. We created thousands of new jobs and hired more than 6,000 veterans last year. While we are very proud of this outstanding year, we are committed to even more. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, our to-do list remains longer than our done list.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So guys, a few things. I think you said $3.5 billion of annual investment in price. Was that right? And what do you include in there? Is that merely price reductions, promotions or something else? Is that sustainable? Do you think you can do $3.5 billion a year? And then what happens to the elasticity of the return over time if the returns remain high on that investment? 
W. McMullen: Yes, that's $3.5 billion, John, that you heard us talk about. Yes, that's an annual number. And that's the annual number in 2014. Now if you look at -- obviously, we started the journey about 10 years ago of taking cost out of the business and taking that -- as we take cost out of the business, giving the customer better value both in everyday price and promotional. We would -- we see it as our strategy to continue that as we take costs out of the business. We'll continue to give that to the customer in a combination of service and price based on what we see the opportunities to be. We are very satisfied with the elasticity of the demand side as we invest in price. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of data that we have developed internally to make sure that we're investing that in the right place where we get the best return. So we would see it sustainable, and it is part of our continued strategy. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add? 
Michael Ellis: No, I think that's it, Rodney. 
John Heinbockel: Okay, so as far as you can tell, there's enough things to invest in that the return will remain -- you think it will remain what it's been, as far as the eye can see, it sounds like. 
W. McMullen: Absolutely. And every category would have different results, and that's one of the values of our insight is understanding that. 
John Heinbockel: All right. And then just one for Mike Schlotman. I know you guys have liked a front-end-loaded buyback program, right, for the productivity that gives you throughout the year. Is that the idea this year? Is that sort of embedded in the guidance, that a lot of it will be done in the first half? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I would say the day-to-day market conditions will wind up dictating when we make those investments, but I would point out the fact that, at the end of -- when we had our conference call in December, we had not used any of the $500 million buyback authorization. And from my comments today, we have used some now. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just want to start maybe with the center store trends. We've heard from a number of large CPG players just about challenges in the -- some of the center store categories. So I wanted to get a sense whether you guys are seeing the same thing. Or any more color what's happening there? 
Michael Ellis: Well, actually, our center store has performed better in the fourth quarter than it had in other quarters in 2014. And we've done a lot of work in relaying our center store, getting things refreshed, new products in. And it's been a big focus of us to using customer insights and really going through our stores and doing the work that's around assortment that's really effective. 
W. McMullen: The other thing that's -- a lot of the CPGs would have something different than what we would have is, a lot of the natural food items, do you include that in center store or a separate department? And it's getting increasingly complicated because there are certain categories where natural foods is almost as big as the historical business. So it's a short question but hard to answer. And for us, we're all -- we're completely focused on what it is the customer wants. 
Rupesh Parikh: And then switching gears maybe to the Simple Truth brand. You achieved your targets this year for sales of more than $1 billion. Do you have any new targets out there? And is it getting more difficult to get the supply for that business? 
Michael Ellis: Supply has been an issue in certain areas, but when you have over 2,600 items, we have a great base of product today, and we're going to continue to expand that. But for the most part, in some of the perishable areas, there's been a supply issue or 2, but we've been able to really take care of the customer. And I don't foresee anything this year in the near future. 
W. McMullen: Yes, but certain categories will always have some tightness on supply, especially at the front end, as farmers transition over to growing more of the organic or natural product. 
Operator: And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: Okay, I have made -- and this is a question for Mike. Do you... 
J. Schlotman: Which one? 
Meredith Adler: Right, that's right. Mike Schlotman. Question about labor negotiations. The very strong performance of the company, do you think that makes it harder for you to get the unions to go along with what you want? Or are they -- maybe a better -- bigger question is, are they pushing for wage increases? 
J. Schlotman: Our -- if you look at our average wage of our hourly associates in the store, it's nearly $14 an hour. And if you look at the total benefit package our associates enjoy, it's even stronger than that. It varies, obviously, by geography and particular contracts, but we've been on the forefront not only with a good solid wage. We've had -- we've been very upfront with the unions and have done a lot of things to protect the future pension benefits of our associates, what -- which others aren't doing out there. It's not just the big one we did 2 or 3 years ago. We did some more smaller ones in the first quarter this year, and it wouldn't surprise me if there'll be others that we wind up doing in the future. If you look overall, we are adding jobs. And we added 25,000 jobs last year. We're up to 400,000 jobs. One of the things that we like to say around Kroger is, a lot of people, particularly part-time workers that are under 18, they come to Kroger looking for a job, and they stay for a career. If you look around the ranks of our store managers, 2/3 of them started out as hourly, part-time hourly associates in our store. And that really just talks to the fabric of Kroger and how well we treat our associates overall. So it's more than just about the wages. There's a lot more behind the scenes of what those associates look for when they come to Kroger. 
W. McMullen: Plus what you make today is something different than you'll make in a -- as you get promoted throughout your career and take on more responsibility. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
Meredith Adler: And then changing gears, maybe just talk a little bit about the test you have of click and collect in Cincinnati. Maybe it's too early to say anything, but are you feeling good about how that's going? 
Michael Ellis: Well, it is too early to really to say anything, Meredith, but the learnings that we have from Harris Teeter is really helping us develop our plans on how we're going to go forward. And Harris Teeter has had a very successful business for -- well, they started over 10 years ago in the click-and-collect world. And we've learned a lot, and it's really helping us accelerate our learning and growth. 
Operator: The next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: Just a little color, I guess, following on John Heinbockel's question. In terms of share buybacks, obviously, your guidance for fiscal '15 is very strong given the tailwind that you're going to have in gas margins. So, I mean, maybe a little color on how much of this is buyback related versus core EBIT growth. I don't know if you can just elaborate a little bit on that. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I won't get that granular on the model. From an expectation standpoint, you should have the expectation we'll probably spend a little bit less on share buyback during -- in terms of dollars in 2015 versus 2014. We are increasing our expectations for capital spend by a few hundred million dollars more just because of the great pipeline of projects I spoke of in the prepared comments. And that's what we think, we would believe, is the driver for growth in the future. Keep in mind, back in October of '12, we said, for the first couple of years of this new growth model, we would have 25 -- 1/4 to 1/3 of our EPS growth may come from share buybacks, but that would decline over time as we continue to open successful stores in our fill-in markets. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the year in general. So when I look at obviously how strong this year was, can you maybe try to frame how much of that was Harris Teeter related in terms of Harris Teeter outperforming what your original guidance was on accretion? I mean, obviously, let's exclude fuel from the conversation. And then just following on that is, when we start to model comps throughout the year, any color on how we should think of how Harris Teeter, now that it's in the comp base, how that'll impact the comps throughout the year? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I won't give specifics on Harris Teeter. I would say that they added a little bit more to earnings per share than our original expectations for the year. They had a phenomenal year. They also helped the core Kroger with some ideas that they have done historically and helped the core Kroger have a very strong year as well. Relative to the comp cadence throughout the year, even though we only had Harris Teeter as a business for this year, we included them in our comp base all year using their 2013 sales. So the sales numbers we reported during 2014 actually included Harris Teeter as though we had owned them in 2013. So there won't be a big inflection point in ID sales from including Harris Teeter going forward. 
Karen Short: Even though the comps might have been pressured from investing in price? 
J. Schlotman: They -- again, their ID sales were included in our 2014 results, so going forward, they'll continue to be in there. 
W. McMullen: Karen, what I would -- I'm just going to add to Mike's thing. If you look at -- Harris Teeter delivered more than we were expecting, and that was driven because of their strong operations and synergies, but -- fuel obviously drove it, but if you look at core Kroger even without those 2 items, we still exceeded as well. So it's really all 3 pieces that drove the strong results. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: The first question, just for Mike Schlotman. On the cadence of the EPS growth next year, Mike, you mentioned Q1 being in line with the range for the year. I guess I would have thought that maybe it would have been better because the fuel comparison's obviously easier there. You still get the benefit from the repo in the first quarter and the share count. And then I would imagine that your comps are probably stronger earlier in the year than later. Could you just maybe help us understand why Q1 would be -- would just be in line? 
J. Schlotman: At this point, that's -- we had a very, very strong first quarter last year, so we are comping off of that. I agree that there will still be some residual benefit in the first quarter from the share buyback, but that was very front-end loaded last year. And we'll -- and as I said earlier, we'll buy less shares back this year than last year. So the combination of those, the way we bought it back last year did hit -- help the first quarter a bit. It's -- a lot of it winds up depending on a huge number of factors. And we just recently finalized our business plan by quarter based off of how the year wound up and what our expectations are for the various quarters. And the best answer I can give you is we're trying to be transparent about how our operators and so forth feel about the cadence throughout the year, and that's what our expectations are. There's a lot of factors that go into it. LIFO certainly will play a factor of how and when we get expense charges in the quarter. As you know, we increased our LIFO charge throughout the year and then it came down in the fourth quarter. So if our estimate for LIFO is accurate this year, second and third quarter will be helped a little bit by a lower LIFO charge as compared to the prior year. So there's lots of things that wind up going into building that model. 
Edward Kelly: And then just a follow-up, and this is just on your IDs generally. Your IDs typically have outpaced the industry for a very long time, but it does seem like, more recently, that this gap has widened. And I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, is there anything that you can identify, do you think, that's driven that acceleration? For instance, you saw a -- the windfall in fuel in the back half. Have you been able to use some of those proceeds to help you around the pricing front, as -- and other things that have maybe helped this acceleration in the outperformance to the industry? 
W. McMullen: Ed, it's a question that actually we have spent a little bit of time trying to think through internally. And probably the biggest thing is our associates, our store teams and their -- and all the people that's work our stores. They continue to do a better job of serving -- helping serve our customers on a daily basis, everything from making sure products are fresher to making sure that we treat our customers right. And we really do believe we had a great foundation in place, and our associates really are taking it up to the next level in terms of how they're taking care of our customers. And we think that that's what's -- the thing that's really been successful, and we really appreciate what our associates are doing. 
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to ask about natural organic, which as you mentioned, of course, continues to see some nice growth, Simple Truth being the main contributor to that. But outside of Simple Truth, can you give any other color in terms of maybe some other category or brand growth within it? And in particular, maybe any early just color around Vitacost, any cross-selling or expansion there? 
Michael Ellis: Great question. Within natural foods, there are so many categories that customers are connecting with today that get stronger and stronger, from dairy products, gluten-free. We can go on and on. And our ability to cross-merchandise some of those products throughout the store, I think, has made some of those products more available in a broader way to a larger customer base. We keep talking about the blurring of departments, and natural foods is becoming more and more mainstream for many people. So it's really broad based when you look at where the growth is. And we're trying all kinds of new things to make these types of products more available to our customers every day. On Vitacost, we love what we have. And it's a solid platform, and we plan to do other things with that over time. And I think you'll be seeing some things in the near future. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay, all right, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up maybe switching over quickly to Harris Teeter. Are all Harris Teeter stores now having the click-and-collect capability? And also, I know that you started in your Harris Teeter banner in one region. Any further plans for rollout that you could talk to for this year, this coming year? 
Michael Ellis: Well, we are doing a -- we're still at beta test in 1 store here in Cincinnati, but at Harris Teeter, we're at about 160-some stores that are currently offering that to the customer. And I'll tell you what, the growth is exciting. Customers love the service, and the numbers continue to grow. We're setting new records at Harris Teeter all the time on more customers shopping this -- in this way. And it's a big part of our strategy going forward. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: So my question is actually more strategic. As we kind of take a step back, you said a couple things, $3.5 billion of investment in price kind of ongoing. I think, Mike Schlotman, you said you pushed up that CapEx growth rate a little bit again, so my question really goes to the top line growth of this organization. I mean, is it time we accelerated it further? It seems like it's gone on a little bit, but I mean, is it time we continue to push? I was talking to one investor, who said, "Kroger is kind of the Costco of the grocery industry at this stage, where they continuously reinvest." So what's your thought? I mean, is the growth rate -- what should we think of as an ongoing top line growth rate? Can it go higher? How do we get it higher? Is this something the company is thinking about? 
W. McMullen: Well, Scott, it's a great question. And it's certainly something we think about. And the investor you were talking to, please pass along our appreciation for the compliment because we have a great deal of respect for Costco. We think about it a lot. In terms of -- I guess, I would really say, use your model to figure out how to accelerate the growth. As you know, we continue to accelerate the number of new stores, and we continue to try to make sure that our identical store sales stay strong. So I think that would automatically cause a continuation of an increasing growth rate, but we've spent a tremendous amount of energy and efforts on trying to accelerate our growth at a pace that makes sense for our organization. And one of the keys is we have to make sure we develop associates to be able to handle the accelerated growth as well. 
Scott Mushkin: And since there -- and we've talked about this before, Rodney, and I appreciate that answer. There's kind of become a Kroger way, a Kroger model driven by, I think, your just advantage in big data. How do you get that model into more consumers' hands in markets maybe that you're not in? I mean it -- you really haven't expanded. I guess Harris Teeter did it for you, but I mean, do you agree that there's a superior model now and it would be advantageous for the company to bring it to more markets? 
W. McMullen: I was going to answer the question until you said the last part. The... 
J. Schlotman: We'll still let him answer, though. 
W. McMullen: The -- I -- we wouldn't ever think that we have a superior way. And all we're really focused on is how to get a little bit better tomorrow than we were yesterday. And for us, that would probably be the biggest part of the Kroger way is really trying to understand what the customers' wants and needs are and trying to get a little bit better at delivering against those. The -- and over time, and numerous times, we've said, anything that's available out there, you should assume that we've looked at it. And it's really making sure that we find something that adds value for our shareholders and something that we think the teams fit in well with Kroger and we can do something for the customer that they don't already have. And when you look at Harris Teeter, it checked all those boxes. And the Harris Teeter team was just amazing, but on smaller scale, Vitacost has been the same way. And a real small scale, YOU Tech has been the same thing. So it's really we're constantly trying to look at things that add new growth for us. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: I was hoping you -- sort of a broad follow-up question from what everybody else has been asking. 2014, you guys have characterized as a somewhat unusually good year. Can you sort of walk us through some of the things that could continue, sort of puts and takes on 2015, and why or why not it could or could not be another unusually kind of good year? And sort of the areas I was hoping you would cover is things like the comp contribution from natural foods. Is that slowing in 2015 versus 2014? The competitive environment seemed to maybe be a little less competitive in 2014 for a lot of food retailers. What does that feel like right now as you look out? And then maybe a little more color on the puts and takes on inflation. Is there anything that could keep inflation from decelerating sequentially as you move through the year? And then the fourth part would be customer trade-up. Was that a significant support to your accelerating comps in 2014? And could that continue in 2015 as a driver? 
J. Schlotman: Okay, one very long question. If I ask you to repeat parts of those -- I was trying to scribble them down. And as everybody here at Kroger knows, when I write slowly, it's hard to read my penmanship. Rodney took them -- took better notes, apparently. The first point on what -- the broad question. We obviously get very thoughtful and step back pretty far when we think about where we should set our expectations for a particular year. We become very careful and protective of the overall business model that we've developed, and that's focused on the customer as front and center. And as we decide what EBITDA growth rate and earnings per share growth rate is appropriate to ask our divisions and our different operating units to generate during a particular fiscal year, that's first and foremost. We really don't start necessarily with, "Here is what the answer has to be." It's, "What can the answer be? And how do we actually build a model that winds up generating that?" From a comp standpoint, there's numbers of factors that can go into where the IDs can wind up being. One of those that you mentioned was inflation. We are expecting a little bit less inflation. That said, as you know, we have a very large and robust pharmacy business. That was a huge driver of the LIFO charge this year. Where that winds up in 2015 is purely a guess at this point. As I've said oftentimes, if we've done nothing else, the ability to predict the LIFO charge is something that is difficult, at best. You mentioned competition. I don't think competition is benign by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's relatively consistent. It's always highly competitive. You never know what a competitor is going to do. We certainly assume that the current competitive condition is not going to get better than it is today. And it's always been a highly competitive industry. There's always new people trying to take part of your business that have different operating models, whether it's a Sprouts or those kinds of operators; or Publix coming into Charlotte like they have, trying to take part of Harris Teeter's business. And we build a model to defend our turf no matter where those folks try to come. When you look at customer trade-up, I would say it's somewhat -- there's a lot of things out there that are affecting broad customer base. Certainly, I think we probably would have seen some trade-up from the customer who has been less affected by the downturn in the economy over the last several years, probably spending a little bit more money in a variety of outlets, certainly some of ours. I would say, that customer who's been on a budget for the last several years, they probably aren't spending a whole lot more money on being big contributors to a consumer-driven economy. They're probably able to take care of some of the bills that they manage on a monthly basis, trying to remember which one they're going to push off for a little while. And they probably have been able to be a little bit more current on their bills but not a whole lot more disposable income. So it's a pretty big mixed bag out there. The -- certainly, the -- where fuel costs are going to wind up and a whole lot of other factors enter into it, but it's -- I know I've been going on for a bit here, but it's a long and difficult -- one, the question was long, but it's -- there's not a precise answer to say, "It's A and B, and that's what drives the final answer." We've taken lot of factors as we plan the year and think about how it's going to wind up being. 
Robert Ohmes: That's very helpful, Mike. Just the one area, just the one last area that I want to ask about. So on natural foods, you guys had big increases in square footage allocation to that space, very noticeable the last couple of years. I think that's slowed a lot. Should we expect less tailwind from natural foods to your comps in 2015 versus what you'd seen in the last couple of years? 
Michael Ellis: I think you're going to continue to see great growth in natural foods. It's more a way of life for our customer today. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing is that, in certain categories, we're starting to integrate it rather than putting it in a separate space as well. 
Operator: And next we have a question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: A couple. Can you help us a bit with how QTD comp trends are proceeding either quantitatively or qualitatively? And I guess, similarly, on 1Q fuel margins to date, any sort of flow-through margin help? Or have retail prices come down enough to maybe offset wholesale ones by this point? 
W. McMullen: If you look at our identical sales so far this quarter, and obviously it's very early in the year because we're just a few weeks into the year, it would be slightly ahead of where we -- the guidance we gave. But it's very early in the year. On fuel margins, I'll -- Mike, we'll have to let you answer that one because I don't know the answer to that one. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think we need to talk about weekly fuel margins. It's difficult enough to predict what the year is going to be, let alone 4 or 5 weeks, because it's such a volatile area and just won't go down that path this morning. 
Kenneth Goldman: That's fair. And my follow-up is you're guiding to inflation being about 1.5% lower than it was in '14. You're talking about maybe a roughly 1.5% deceleration in total ID sales x fuel. So always risky embarrassing myself asking a simple math question, but is it fair to assume your guidance is thus implying that everything outside passing along inflation, like sort of traffic and basket size, you're expecting that to grow at a similar rate in '15 as '14, roughly? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, as Mike Ellis said in his remarks, we had great tonnage growth throughout the year, and it accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we don't see any reason why that would slow down during the year. And it's it winds up being in our hands to continue that underlying unit growth. 
Operator: The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just first, wanted to double check on guidance. So I think the message for next year is you had the very strong benefit from the fuel margins in the back half, but you have lower LIFO, no -- none of the pension. You don't cycle that pension expense again next year and the foundation expense. And so net-net, you still can kind of maintain that 8% to 11% earnings growth, but it sounds like fuel still may be somewhat of a headwind. So I don't know if you can maybe parse out the net impact of those factors that were kind of swing factors this year just to help us kind of think about how -- the guidance for 2015. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, you -- if you look at where fuel margins benefited us, and we talked about what the fuel margins were for the year, you know roughly what our gallons are over time, so you can probably figure out the incremental benefit from a margin standpoint on fuel. So if you think about that normalizing and then LIFO being -- expectation being lower, not having the pension contribution or the contribution to the charitable foundation, they don't perfectly offset one another but they come close to being -- negating one another, and that's why we're growing off of the $3.52 at the 8% to 11%. Keep in mind, all of that information aside, our core operations without those would have been at the high end of our 8% to 11% range all by themselves last year. And it's really that underlying strength in the core business that gives us the comfort to be able to have another great year in the 8% to 11% range. 
Kelly Bania: Perfect, that's very helpful. And then just on the comps for the quarter. I think, when you were planning the comps for the quarter in Q3, you talked about cycling the benefit from the weather. Just curious what really came in better than expected for the fourth quarter in terms of those core ID comps. Was there a weather benefit? Or did you just kind of hang onto some of those customers that maybe were pushed into your stores last year with the weather? Or just curious, thoughts there. 
W. McMullen: Yes, we -- the weather would not have been as helpful this year as it was prior year. So it was really hanging onto some of those customers and really the operating and merchandising teams doing a great job of making sure that we had strong programs to cycle that weather. So it was really the team executing and doing a great job. 
J. Schlotman: Okay. And we'll take one more question. 
Operator: Okay, and that final question will come from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Wanted to get some thoughts on, now that you're contemplating more of these fill-in markets, what should we be thinking about for a longer-term square footage growth rate for you? Because you have been fading off of your store closures, so I'm curious what the flow-through is going to be on actual net square footage growth. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, it's really difficult to predict exactly how many operational closings you're going to have in a particular year. And there's a wide variety of reasons those happen, but if you look at our gross, we expect it to be 2% to 2.5% next year. Our net was a little bit under 1% last year. Our store count has been down. Keep in mind, sometimes when we close an underperforming store, we may be closing an underperforming store, it's underperforming because its sales per square foot are at the way low end of a range of what would make that store profitable. And as we replace that store or open a new store that's larger than that, the net square footage may not go up dramatically, but the sales per square foot of that new store can often be several multiples of the store we closed. So it's a little misleading just to say, "Oh, square footage growth hasn't been that much so they can't grow sales that much." The difference between that productivity of the new store and the store we closed can be quite remarkable sometimes. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And were there any tax implications from the charitable contribution in the fourth quarter, or anything that carries into 2015? 
J. Schlotman: No. Obviously, we got a tax deduction for that, but it didn't affect the tax rate in any way, shape or form. And we've just taken advantage of the opportunity of a very strong year to be able to continue to have dollars to support the efforts that we support, both that are important to us and are important to our customers. 
W. McMullen: I want to thank everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. And before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.
 I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. We finished 2014 strong, thanks to your commitment in providing friendly service and fresh products to our 8 million customers every time, every day. Thank you to each and every one of you for making a difference with our customers and for each other.
 As many of you know, our community service awards honor and recognize our associates who, through their widespread volunteer activity, charitable involvement and leadership, make a difference in the communities where we live, work and raise our families. Nominations for our 2014 community service awards are now being accepted. Whether you support the hungry, veterans and active-duty military, cancer awareness or your favorite local organization, I encourage you to apply and -- or nominate a coworker for this prestigious award. Winners from each division will receive a donation to their charity of choice. Make sure you connect with your HR manager for more information and nomination deadlines in your division.
 Thank you for all you do. Your work in our communities is simply amazing.
 That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2014-12-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.
 A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks in this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 Thanks, again, to those who participated in our October investor conference in person or via webcast. We appreciate that many of you made the trip to Cincinnati, and as always, we enjoyed the dialogue and the opportunity to show you our stores. 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chief Executive Officer. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Kroger continues to deliver consistently remarkable results. We are well on our way to achieving our 10th consecutive year of lowering costs and reinvesting those savings in our people, products, pricing and improved store experience, which together are driving our growth. Few can deliver this level of sustainable high performance. 
 After a while, it can be easy to take this consistency and reliability for granted. So it's important to keep in mind that these results are possible only because 375,000 associates engage with our customers every single day. 
 Our associates delivered yet another quality quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We continue to implement our growth strategy and consistently deliver on the key performance indicators we first outlined in October 2012. 
 In the third quarter, we achieved our 44th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continued to gain market share. 
 Our third quarter financial results were driven by strong sales and core business performance, which was better than we expected. Higher fuel margins drove our results above our previous guidance range. 
 Our guidance range for the full year assumes fuel margins will not be as strong in the fourth quarter as they were in the third quarter. Mike Schlotman will have more to say about our supermarket fuel operations in a few minutes. 
 How our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their family finances. Overall, our customers continue to spend a little more as confidence in the economy improves over time. While inflation is apparent in certain commodities, fuel prices have been going down, which helps all customers, especially those on a budget. We try to help those customers stretch their food budget in a variety of ways. Our weekly promotions and fuel rewards help, along with price investments. 
 We continue to make natural and organic foods affordable and accessible to all customers, especially with Simple Truth. Our expansive corporate brands offering is resonating with customers seeking high-quality food at very good prices. 
 In fact, our Corporate Brands had their best performance in several years in the third quarter. Our ability to deliver this combination of value sets us apart. 
 Now I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to discuss our operational performance in the third quarter. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which, incidentally, was also up for the quarter. 
 Loyal household growth is an important measure of our business because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. Inflation increased in the third quarter, as Rodney mentioned, among commodities such as meat and pharmacy and increased to a lesser extent in all other supermarket departments. 
 As Mike Schlotman will discuss shortly, we raised our LIFO charge estimate for the year again this quarter due to the higher-than-expected inflation. We estimate inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the third quarter. Even so, we saw strong tonnage growth in the third quarter compared to last year. And in fact, it was slightly ahead of the second quarter's unit growth. 
 Corporate Brands had an outstanding third quarter, representing 27.3% of total units sold and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. In fact, Corporate Brands experienced its highest sales growth and total retail dollar share of any quarter in the last 3 years. So clearly, our rebranding -- rebranded opening price point in Kroger banner brands are a hit with our customers. 
 Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics continued to earn double-digit unit and sales growth. A key driver of Kroger's sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have been highlighting innovations that are improving our connection with customers. 
 This quarter, I will highlight some of the new and exciting work of our manufacturing team in the dairy department. We recently opened a state-of-the-art dairy processing plant in Denver. We built and engineered the plant to deliver exceptional quality and freshness for our customers and to provide an avenue for innovation in the dairy category. We incorporated new technologies for our customers that ensure our milk will stay fresher longer than ever before. 
 We are the first dairy in the U.S. to deploy robotic technology that enables us to pack cases and pick and palletize orders entirely by automation. Another innovation that this dairy will bring is the ability for us to produce long shelf life products to meet growing demand for aseptic products and packaging. 
 The dairy, our first ground-up manufacturing plant of any kind in 20 years, opened in May and began full production of fresh milk in August. We have been producing fresh milk, organic milk, juices and drinks, and customer response has been very, very positive. 
 Now I'd like to give a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations covering Smith's associates in New Mexico, Fry's and Smith's associates in Arizona, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Toledo, West Virginia and the Ohio Valley. 
 We are currently negotiating with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension cost, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. 
 Before I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to thank our associates for the impressive quarter. Once again, you showed our customers how much we care about them, and each and every day, you continue to deliver. Because of your efforts, we are able to continue investing in our products, lowering prices and improving the shopping experience in ways that generate customer loyalty. 
 Now Mike will offer more detail on our financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, when we outlined our growth strategy in 2012, we identified the key performance targets for our shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. 
 Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Identical sales performance is the best measure of our growing connection with customers over time. 
 We're very pleased with our third quarter ID sales growth of 5.6% without fuel. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every supermarket department and division, and our natural foods department continues to lead with double-digit growth. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 9 basis points. This exceeded our goal of slightly -- to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4 quarters basis. 
 We are not reporting our third metric, return on invested capital, this quarter because the calculation would actually overstate our result. We expect our year-end return on invested capital, which will fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to be similar to our return on invested capital at the end of fiscal 2013. 
 Now I'll share the rest of our third quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's consolidated results of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. 
 In the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $362 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This includes a $0.04 benefit in the third quarter due to certain tax items. 
 Excluding these items, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $345 million or $0.69 per diluted share for the third quarter. We view these tax benefits as nonrecurring. So as you begin to think about 2015, please note that we will not be growing off of that next year. 
 Net earnings in the same period last year were $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net earnings per diluted share benefited from certain adjustments totaling $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these adjustments, last year's third quarter net earnings were $0.53 per diluted share. 
 We recorded an $85 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year, resulting in an incremental $0.09 per diluted share charge to net earnings in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating a LIFO charge for the year at $55 million. 
 At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million, and at the end of the second quarter, we increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $100 million. As reported this morning, we have again increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $180 million. 
 FIFO [ph] gross margin decreased 2 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the adjustment items, decreased 21 basis points as a percent of sales compared with the prior year as a result of good expense control and strong sales leverage. 
 Now for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.232 compared to $0.171 in the same quarter last year. This does not include debit and credit card fees. 
 Last year's third quarter margin was well above historical averages, which means this quarter's margin performance was remarkable. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital expenditures. 
 Achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has yet not realized the full year Harris Teeter EBITDA. As a result, the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.29 as of the close of the third quarter compared to 1.86 during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of our press release. This is an improvement of -- from the 2.33 reported last quarter. 
 Kroger's net total debt is $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago, including the debt related to Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase program. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. 
 During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 600,000 common shares for a total investment of $29 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization granted in June remains available. 
 Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $681 million for the third quarter compared to $641 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments to be at the low end of the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014. 
 Now I'd like to review our updated growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong third quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.32 to $3.36 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.22 to $3.28 per diluted share. 
 For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 4% to 5%. We acknowledge this is a wide range for one quarter, and we are seeing great strength and momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, but this year's fourth quarter is difficult to project narrowly because of the uncertainties relative to a year ago, including the positive effect that weather had on our identical supermarket sales during last year's fourth quarter. 
 As you start to think about fiscal 2015 estimates, we encourage you to build your models based on fiscal 2014 adjusted results, which exclude certain tax benefits and charges related to the restructuring of certain pension plan agreements. If fuel margins return to historical levels, we expect 2015 results to be closer to the low end of our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. 
 Now I'll return it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Our third quarter performance is further evidence that Kroger is improving our connection with customers and delivering growth for our shareholders. We continue to increase capital investments, which creates exciting opportunities for our business and for our associates. We enjoyed discussing several of those opportunities with you during our investor conference in October. Our positive momentum is expected to carry through to the fourth quarter and sets us up well as we look to 2015. More importantly, Kroger's to-do list remains longer than our done list. There is a lot more to come. 
 Now we will look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: Just a couple of questions regarding your guidance and, I guess, also this quarter. So obviously, gas margins more than offset the higher LIFO charge this quarter, and this year has been an incredible year from an earnings growth perspective. But I guess, what my question is, looking to next year, Mike, you talked about the lower end of the range of earnings growth. And I understand you're coming off of a very strong year. So my question for this current year is, was the strength more in overachieving on the Harris Teeter accretion side? Or was it broad-based across the core and Harris Teeter? And I guess that would lead me to, if it was broad-based across -- or if it was more Harris Teeter related, that explains why you might be at the lower end of the 8% to 11% next year. But if it was broad-based across Harris Teeter and the core, are you just being conservative for next year, even though this year was incredibly strong? 
J. Schlotman: Wow. There was like 3 or 4 questions in there. Which way do I go with the answer? Well, fundamentally, this has been a very strong year across the board for us with the ID sales that we've had so far this year and ID -- positive ID sales in every department and positive ID sales in every geography. Our core business is performing extremely well. It's not just incremental accretion from Harris Teeter, it's strong results from all of our core operations. The primary reason for the conversation about being at the low end of 8% to 11% for next year is solely where fuel is at $0.23 for the quarter. And really, the last 2 quarters have been well above historical averages with the amount of fuel gallons we sell and that kind of outperformance on historical fuel margins. We just wanted people to be aware as they start thinking about 2015 of that potential headwind. If you were to kind of take the business apart and look at our core operations for 2015, they would perform extremely well inside the 8% to 11% range, and it's really just a headwind from a potential lower fuel margin per gallon for next year. 
Karen Short: And is it fair to say that Harris Teeter has come in slightly better than expected for the year so far? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I would characterize Harris Teeter as performing how we expected them to perform. We've -- as has been widely publicized, they've not been shy about advertising it. We've made the price investments in their business that we expected to make during the year. The customers are responding to those price investments, and I would characterize Harris Teeter as right on track with what our expectations would be relative to our overall guidance for the year. 
W. McMullen: The Harris Teeter team has done a nice job of running their own business, but the other thing is they've been incredibly helpful helping teach all of Kroger some ideas as well. So it's been great so far, and the synergy's moving along as we expected as well. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then, just last question. On next year's earnings growth, what's embedded in terms of share buybacks? 
J. Schlotman: We'll give full guidance in March. We just know that at this time of the year, with 3 quarters behind us, clearer fourth quarter guidance, since we only have one quarter left, people start to refine their 2015 estimates. And we just wanted to give some insight of our view of a percentage growth rate and where we would expect to fall in that range as you all start to prepare your estimates for 2015 or refine those estimates. But we'll wait until we give full guidance in March. We feel we've gone far enough with the EPS because our board has its annual business plan review meeting in January, and it's probably better served to let them approve our business plan for next year before I give you too many lines. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Regarding gas, so we've historically found it difficult to find any real correlation between gas prices and comps. What are you seeing during the most recent period since these declines? I know you've recently touched on it before. But is there any particular region to call out? You mentioned the low -- lower-income consumer. Or is there any demographic that you can expand on as well? 
W. McMullen: The -- if you look at our own numbers, we would have difficulty finding some of the same correlations. When gas prices go up, our fuel reward program has a little bit more strength. As gas prices go down, people have more money to spend. So as you know, when we look at fuel, we just look at one more service that we're offering the customer and one more reason to come to Kroger. The comments that we made -- that Mike and I both made, we continue to see improvement in the economy. It's slow, but it's going in the right direction, and it's really across all customers. But if you look at mainstream and up, those customers have fully recovered. The customers that are on a budget are improving, but it's much slower and more constrained. 
Steven Forbes: Okay. And then just on the deployment of these windfalls, is there -- I'm sure there's thoughts around how to invest these benefits. But do they occur too quickly in order to appropriately plan for the deployment? Or is it just better to let it flow through to the bottom line? How do you guys think about these onetime or short-term benefits? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at like the tax settlements and stuff, we just let those, for the most part, be when they are. And we just disclose it to let you know what it is. And it flows to the bottom line, but it's onetime. If it's things that we think are things that are sustainable, those are the things that we would look at in terms of continuing to invest in the business from a service standpoint and a price standpoint. But it's -- as you mentioned, it's always a balance between those 2 pieces, and we are always focused on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that opportunity when it happens. So it doesn't answer your question directly because the answer's actually different depending on what we see the opportunities to be. 
Operator: Our next question is from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. 
Judah Frommer: Judah on for Ed. You mentioned in the release and also on the call the kind of rolling 4-quarter x fuel operating margin being a little bit stronger than you expected it to be. I mean, is that a way of saying you would have liked to maybe invest more in price? Or how should we kind of translate that? 
J. Schlotman: I don't think it's a reflection of having -- wanting to invest more in price. It's really a reflection of having Harris Teeter in for a portion of the year and not all year compared to results last year that didn't have Harris Teeter in the numbers. And I would say that's the same thing for the -- just a couple of basis points decline in the gross margin number I talked about. If you were to strip Harris Teeter out of the prior year, you would have seen a much bigger amount that we have invested in, in price to continue to give value to our customers, but it's really that -- the fact that their historical numbers have been higher than ours, and it's the mention of those together that's driving some unusual comparisons. We've continued right on track with what our expectations were for investment in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, not just price, but the people, the products and the shopping experience as well, and continue to be very pleased with the reaction our customers have with those investments. 
Judah Frommer: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in there, maybe shifting gears. On natural organic, it sounds like it's still comping really well. You've mentioned, in the past, maybe eventually seeing some margin compression in the category. And now that you have one of the bigger players in this space with a national ad campaign out there highlighting value, have you seen anything in kind of the near term on margins there? 
Michael Ellis: I haven't really seen margin pressure overall. We continue to invest in price where we feel appropriate, and the customer really drives our pricing strategy for the most part. But again, we had strong sales growth and double-digit growth in national organics. And to go back to our Simple Truth brand, which will hit $1 billion this year, we're really proud of where that's going and what it's contributing. 
Operator: Our next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: I also wanted to ask a bit more on the natural organic. Obviously, Simple Truth continues to perform very well. But can you also give us a little color on how some of the other categories and products within natural organic are doing? And maybe touch upon, also, some of the Vitacost products? 
Michael Ellis: Well, in natural foods, the expansion of item selection is continuing to grow. And you're finding more and more products in the dairy category. We just introduced a new line, the Simple Truth lunchmeats. So there's a lot of activity. And we're still finding so many of our customers that didn't shop natural foods are beginning to migrate over to that business, which has been really, really good for us. On the Vitacost piece, we're still in a honeymoon. It's only been a couple of month since we merged with Vitacost, and there's a lot of work going on, but we have big plans for Vitacost, and we're excited about the merger. I've been to the facilities, down to their offices, to their warehouses, and it's a great business that we have. And we're excited about where we're going to go into next year. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay. Great. And just a follow-up, if I may. Regarding your relationship, the dunnhumby relationship, as you continue to have nice growth in your loyal households and loyal customers, I know that part of what you're looking at is also not only continuing to have your current loyal customers purchase more, but also convert others into being loyal customers. Can you talk about any -- if there are any either new strategies or learnings that you're finding as you're going through? 
W. McMullen: If you look at all of our data insights, and dunnhumby that you referenced is obviously one piece of that, but there's a lot of other insights, you're continually getting insights and testing things. And the things that work, you do more of, and the ones that don't work, you stop doing. And that never stops. So it's an ongoing basis in terms of trying to understand customer needs. So if you think about your earlier question on natural and organics, well, that's some insights from our customers. But one of the things our customers are very clear is they don't want to have to pay a premium for natural and organics, and we're trying to make sure that we have where they can get a good-quality product at a price that's comparable to the nonorganic brands and, in some cases, actually the same price. So it's, really, that would just be one example, but there's a whole host of things where you're continually trying to get insights, insights on actually where to locate stores. It's broad parts of our business, and it's actually getting that insight and using it is the key. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I just wanted to just touch on inflation. Clearly, you had a nice benefit in inflation this quarter. I just want to see if you guys can share, maybe, your early thoughts for inflation for the upcoming year. 
J. Schlotman: As we sit here today, we would actually expect -- I'm always hesitant to go here because I've proven my inability to predict this with the fluctuations we have on our LIFO charge, which is tied to inflation, but we would expect inflation next year to be a little bit more moderate than it is this year. Clearly, the protein categories don't really show any signs of letting up on inflation. Chicken may happen if corn prices stay down at some point, but beef and pork, we would expect to see probably close to double-digit inflation again next year. Milk, at this point, again, as you know, the milk prices are driven by federal market order. As we sit here today, it looks like they may come in some, which would help a lot of categories next year. But overall, just given where some of the core input categories are, it looks like we should be a little bit lower than the 3.5% that's out there. That said, embedded in that 3.5% is pharmaceuticals, which continue to have -- particularly in the generic category, which has not always been the case, which continue to have quite high inflation in them. 
W. McMullen: One of the things that we think is important, when you look at inflation over the last 10 years, Kroger's been able to really manage in all inflationary environments, whether there's been deflation or inflation. There's always a transition if it suddenly changes quickly, very high or very low, to manage that transition. But over time, we've found that we really -- our associates have the ability to manage in all environments. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gear to your ID sales. Do you feel -- as you look at your IDs this quarter, do you feel that you're maybe winning new customers maybe at an accelerated pace from earlier this year? 
W. McMullen: The thing that's exciting, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, we're seeing good growth with our existing customers, but we're also seeing new loyal shoppers. And so it's really balanced across both, and that's one of the things exciting. And it's been -- it's a little bit higher now than earlier in the year, but it was strong earlier in the year, as well. I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything. 
Michael Ellis: No. I think you hit it. It's just -- it's been solid, yes. Thanks, Rodney. 
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: Mine's actually much more of a kind of strategic, long-term question and just trying to understand kind of the growth trajectory of the company. You guys were nice enough to take us to a Marketplace store, I think, that was converted from a regular grocery store. And it seems like that conversion has gone quite well. So I guess I'm just trying to understand. It seems, as we think about Kroger, that in a lot of ways, you have a better mousetrap at this stage, and that Marketplace store is certainly one of the key elements. You guys went through -- and this goes way back in the, I think, late '60s, early '70s, into a big kind of store upgrade cycle, and you became a good to great stock in Jim Collins' work. I mean, how close are we to really getting into a big upgrade cycle on your store fleet where you really deploy Marketplace in a much more aggressive way? So that's my first question about long-term growth. 
W. McMullen: Well, as you know, when you were out in October, we're obviously very excited about the Marketplace stores and the use of all our formats together. It's one of the reasons why, a couple of years ago, we committed and -- to increase our capital investment by $200 million a year, and we continue to do that. We think that's a good amount to accelerate capital by in terms of the ability to operate the store at the level that you saw and balance in terms of the use of the cash flow. As long as -- as we continue to get the performance from those stores as we expect, you'll see it to continue accelerating that capital investment. But that was the reason why, in October of '12, we outlined the need to increase capital by $200 million a year. I don't know, Mike, if you want to... 
J. Schlotman: No, I would agree with that, and it's -- we -- as you know, Scott, we continue to expect increased capital over the next several years by incremental amounts. I -- if there's one disappointment I have so far this year, it's that -- actually, that we're at the low end of our CapEx guidance. I know some people out there think we spend too much on CapEx, but that just means some stores aren't coming out of the ground as quickly as we had hoped. It doesn't mean that we're less bullish on the new stores we're opening. It's just a matter of timing of those projects, and they will get caught up. So we're very bullish on our ability to continue to open new stores and have them perform very well. 
Michael Ellis: One other comment. We have Marketplace stores now in just about every division of our company across the country, and the success we're having with the Marketplace store has been really pleasing. But you asked about remerchandising, and I know you saw apparel in some of our stores now. We're having some success in -- with some of these new brands, some of the new products we're putting in. So we continue to work on the model to make it relevant to the customer, but we're really pleased with what we have today. 
Scott Mushkin: And as a follow-up -- I mean, any thought process as to how many stores in the store fleet could eventually be Marketplace? 
J. Schlotman: We probably do, but probably not for public consumption at this point, Scott. The other thing to keep in mind is, as we go down this path, and you'll probably see it a little clearer as we get into next year, we continue to invest in our business. And a fundamental piece of being able to invest in our business is continuing to generate a really good return on our new investments. And some of those dollars, we make conscious decisions of how many fall to the bottom line and how many we invest back into the business and the people, product, shopping experience and price. And while I know a lot of you would think that we should be at the end of investing in price, we still see plenty of categories and particular sections of the store where we have an opportunity to be more price competitive than we are today. So we're, in some respects, counting on that continued good results from that deployment of capital to both increase to have the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth and have the dollars generated to invest back in our business. 
Scott Mushkin: And then I just had one more, and then I'll yield. And it goes to the long-term growth again. M&A, we talked about it at the Analyst Day. It seems, again, Kroger, better mousetrap, fuel program, dunnhumby, customer insights, Marketplace store. It seems, as you guys evaluate -- at least from my perspective, evaluate M&A activity, there's almost a checklist of what you might want out of a company that you were going to acquire. But it does seem like it's a little bit different now, given the success you have with your business. Any thoughts, any additional thoughts? Again, I know asked this at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to revisit it. 
W. McMullen: Yes, I wouldn't say that there's anything much different than what we answered. As we talked about then, one of the keys on any merger, how's the -- how are the people that run the business? And do we think, culturally, they have the same values we have? And that's one of the reasons why we always talk about mergers rather than acquisition. You get a more limited number of opportunities when you have that standard, but what we find is, when people have that standard, they like it going the other direction, as well. And we always like to point out the fact that 2 of our last 3 CEOs came out of one of our merged companies and several of our senior officers. 
J. Schlotman: And our current President... 
W. McMullen: Yes, came out of one of the merged companies. So I think you're right when you say it's almost a checklist because it is, but it's something that's really worked well for us. 
J. Schlotman: And Scott, something I would add to that. And I certainly understand your question and the seeming benefits we could bring to some M&A activity that may be not as strong as we may hope or not have everything on our checklist. When you sit back and you have opportunity x and you look around the organization as a company in our geographies where we are today, and you can clearly see where you can double market share in specific geographies by deploying new capital in those geographies. And you have a base of people and a recognition in that market and already strong customer acceptance. We typically default to that fill-in strategy that we talked about because it's a much surer thing, takes a lot less time and energy of the organization, has significantly less management distraction. And we're perfectly willing to sit and almost wait, not necessarily troll around the country for those opportunities to come long like the Harris Teeter did. 
W. McMullen: The other thing that would be needed for us to change our approach is if we find that we're able to develop talent faster than we can use it within our existing growth where -- because if we bought something that was something that needed to be fixed up, we would obviously need to figure out a way to put talent into it in a way that was effective. And that would require a different level of talent than we're producing today because we're really focused on developing the talent to support the growth we have. 
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Could you give us a little perspective on just how much the gas gain was in EPS terms? And what quarter should we really think about the headwinds starting to arrive as you lap the stronger margins from last year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We -- Mark, we won't go into the benefit of the EPS benefit. But if you think about a $0.23 fuel margin and $0.17 last year, you get a feel -- we talked about, in a lot of places, the number of gallons that we pump. So you should be able to back into a number that gets you relatively close. We just don't want to -- we think about that department as any other department inside the company, and it happens to be performing very well right now. I would say, clearly, the second and third quarter of next year, if margins revert to a more historical kind of level, would start to experience some headwind from lower fuel margins. Again, we didn't say "when" in the comments purposefully. We said "if" because nobody can really predict where it is. And we typically turn fuel a lot faster than our competitors. So in down cycles, that's good. In up cycles, that's bad. So if fuel were to turn the other way and -- or oil was to turn the other way and start going up, that actually creates an incremental headwind, not just a normal headwind, because we're turning the fuel so quickly. But clearly, second and third quarter. 
W. McMullen: And one of the things, as Mike mentioned earlier, we have a January meeting with our board for them to actually approve our '15 plan. Normally, we would not share '15 details until the fourth quarter earnings release, but we just thought it would be helpful to give a little bit of color on what we're thinking and what we're seeing before then for next year. 
Mark Wiltamuth: That's fair. And then, on the inflation in those meat categories where you're still seeing that double-digit inflation, are you passing all that through? Because we are hearing some other retailers are having some difficulty passing it through. 
J. Schlotman: Well, inflation for us -- inflation and deflation come and go all the time, and we're constantly dealing with pricing and how do we continue to give value to the customer through inflation and deflation, whether it's meat, produce or any other part of our business. So we try to manage it in a way that still gives great value to the customer, and the customer decides what they're going to pay. But I can tell you our tonnage is good, and inflation is extremely high right now. And we're just trying to really manage our way through it. 
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: As you think about just the broader industry, I was hoping you could just talk maybe about where you think some of the gains that you're getting are coming from, how you see that evolving. I think it was at an Analyst Day a few years back where you discussed some of the regional players ceding share pretty consistently. Are you seeing that accelerate? Or is there anything else that you can just talk to broadly? 
W. McMullen: It's -- as you know, we don't ever talk about specific competitors. In terms of where the market share is coming from, it's always easier to ask the question than it is to see. It looks pretty broad-based in terms of where it's coming from, but we see, at some other national players, they are gaining share as well. So we're not the only one. But there's still about half of the market that's out there that's not people with our economies of scale, and it's not necessarily just small regional people. Some of them could be a little bit bigger. And then the other piece is we continue to add categories that we didn't even have before, which is helping some of our growth. 
Stephen Grambling: That's helpful. And then, are you seeing any difference in terms of the comp performance by the format of your stores? And do you feel like, after so many years of positive ID growth or productivity growth, that you're hitting a ceiling in any of these? 
W. McMullen: It's a good question. It's -- if you look at the comps, you always have pockets that are better than others, but it's very broad-based. And when you look at age and other things, obviously, newer stores will have a higher comp than older stores. But outside of that, there's nothing that would cause us to say one thing or the other. And probably -- I'm sure we have some stores that are getting close to capacity, but as a general rule, we have plenty of capacity within our existing stores to continue to increase the business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just wanted to ask about the guidance for the fourth quarter for IDs. You mentioned the difficulty in forecasting when you cycle that benefit from the winter weather last year. I'm just curious if you are able to or have been able to at all look at your data and use dunnhumby and see how much of that boost that you may have had last year was from existing or loyal customers versus new customers and if there's any strategies in place to help kind of cycle that benefit that you may have had last winter. 
J. Schlotman: Well, clearly, we can understand where that business is coming from, and in those -- in regions where the snow or the weather is going to be -- get volatile in a big way, you get a lot of people from all spectrums of the loyalty umbrella, if you will, from people who rarely shop with you, but they come to you because you might be the one that is on stock on product, to your most loyal customers who come in and stock up. Obviously, we aren't -- for the fourth quarter, Mike Donnelly and Robert Clark and their merchandising group isn't sitting back just hoping for weather for us to be able to cycle the great sales we had last year's fourth quarter. They know what days and what weeks there was weather, and they would have strategies in place to try to cover some of the uplift we had in the -- from that snow. But the amount of incremental volume you get in a 36-hour period from snow is phenomenal, and it would be a Herculean effort on their part to be able to come up with strategies to overcome all of it. Clearly, we're going to go do our best to overcome it the best we can. We'll have weather. We don't know when. We don't know where. We don't know what day. We don't know... 
W. McMullen: Or how much. 
J. Schlotman: We don't know if it'll be by the end of January. We don't know if it'll be in February, March at the beginning of the next year. But it happens every year. You just don't know when. 
W. McMullen: Yes, the other thing is, when you look at the weather, I have a couple of friends that own quite a few fast food restaurants. And they will -- they always tell me that they hate snow because it actually has the opposite effect on them. So it's actually some of our increase is getting business that customers would sometimes be going to other channels. And obviously, when kids stay home, they're eating at home versus eating at school. So some of it is just switching where somebody eats. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
Kelly Bania: Got it. That's helpful. And then just another question on gross margin. Your FIFO gross margin x fuel only down 2 basis points in spite of some of the high inflation you mentioned in some categories, just any comments on the ability to pass that through and how that maybe compares to historical standards? I mean, are you finding it easier or the same in terms of passing along inflation at these high levels in some of the protein categories? 
J. Schlotman: As always, it's almost a category-by-category decision on where the inflation is and what the price points are doing to the customers. And if you pass it all on, what do you think the effect on units is going to be? And if you don't quite pass it all on, are you better off at the end of the day not passing all of it on? So it's a category-by-category decision. And I know Mike Donnelly and his team spent a lot of time trying to decide exactly what price points and how much of inflation to pass on and when to pass it on. I do want to reiterate that a couple of basis point decline in gross margin would have been a more normal decline in gross margin -- when I say normal, kind of the historical kind of numbers you would have seen in 2013 versus '14 if not having Harris Teeter in this year and not in the base. We continued to invest in the price -- actually, all 4 keys of the strategy this quarter. It's just that, with Harris Teeter being in there at a higher gross than we typically have run, it makes that decline look smaller. 
W. McMullen: The other piece in terms looking at it on a -- from a historical standpoint, part of it is trying to decide how long is the inflation going to be in place. In some items, we would anticipate inflation is only going to be 4 to 8 to 12 weeks, depending on if it's weather-driven or if it's industry and other driven. That will also affect our ability and influence on how we try to pass that through as well. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: If -- you're mentioning sales were off to a strong start thus far in the quarter. Can you give us a little detail on that, including general merchandise sales and how you did thus far in the holiday selling area period? 
W. McMullen: Yes. So far, if you look, it would be kind of -- fortunately, it's a similar comment that we made earlier or, I guess, really at last quarter. So far, we would be at the top end of the range. It's broad-based in all departments, so it's across the whole store. So we feel really good. The thing that makes it a little more complicated is we haven't cycled -- we're just now starting to cycle some of the weather from a year ago. So that's one of the reasons why we would get the wide range in kind of Mike's comments earlier. 
Charles Cerankosky: Yes, I understand, Rodney, on the weather comparisons. That's just going to be tough to predict and deal with. But just wanted to see what the actuals look like so far. And can you... 
W. McMullen: And then -- and jewelry, also, is good so far. And obviously, that's one of the most discretionary areas that we have. 
Charles Cerankosky: I didn't know it was discretionary. 
J. Schlotman: I have so many comments. 
Charles Cerankosky: I -- also, could you repeat the private label percentages? I missed those earlier in the call. 
W. McMullen: Yes, Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Well, overall we were really pleased with the total private label sales. And our Kroger brand, which is our workhorse, showed really strong sales growth again. And in fact, all of the different banners -- brands, excuse me, really performed well, whether it's Simple Truth and Private Selection, all of those. But Corporate Brands in the third quarter represented 27.3% of total units and 25.8% of sales dollars. That's without fuel and pharmacy. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ajay Jain of Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Ajay Jain: My question is guidance related. I can understand why you might be slightly cautious in your outlook for next year if fuel margins revert to more normal levels. But your outlook for the fourth quarter, I think, is around 10% EPS growth if I use the midpoint of the range. So first, as a comment, I would have thought that the benefit from fuel could be potentially even higher in the fourth quarter based on the difference between the retail pump prices and wholesale prices and then looking at the year-over-year comparisons. So I was curious if you had any comment on that. And then, apart from fuel, are there any reasons why you're guiding to earnings growth lower in Q4 on a sequential basis? 
J. Schlotman: It would be primarily where fuel has been. Also, keep in mind our LIFO charge continues to go up throughout the year, and that's a bit of a headwind to earnings per share as well. And the single reason for the conversation about 2015 -- and again, I remind you we used the word if because it's difficult to project, it's really just the headwind that fuel potentially represents, 23 point -- a little over $0.23 margin on fuel. We've been in the fuel business a long time, and I personally don't remember a time where we've had anywhere near that kind of a number, and it's really difficult to predict where that may go. And again we're just -- we're trying to be transparent and let everybody know what we're thinking. 
W. McMullen: And what the key assumption is. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, what the key assumption is. Right. 
Ajay Jain: And as a follow-up, I think in November, you cycled the SNAP reductions from last year. Is that a material benefit at all in terms of how you're looking at it? And then are you factoring in any recent changes in the competitive environment or shift in behavior by the consumer around the holidays into your fourth quarter outlook? 
W. McMullen: When you look at SNAP and then you look at that customer overall, their spending may have been down on SNAP specifically, but customers are using and have been using more of their own cash. So when you look at that like customer base, it actually increased. Hopefully, that customer's increased spending in cash is driven because their economic situation's better. That, we don't know. But that's been up all year. And we continue to see the household spending for a SNAP household increase. It's not increasing at the same rate as the overall company, but it is going up. 
Ajay Jain: Okay. And finally, you may have mentioned this previously, but did you disclose the quarter-to-date comps, the actual figure? 
W. McMullen: No, we did not. 
J. Schlotman: Just said is... 
W. McMullen: At the high end. 
J. Schlotman: High end of our range for the quarter. 
Operator: Our next question is from Stacie Rabinowitz of Consumer Edge Research. 
Stacie  Rabinowitz: You had mentioned that you were actually thinking about specific categories for further price investment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and then the extent to which either the increase in protein prices or the decrease in gas prices are changing how you're thinking about where you're investing in price? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we're very guarded about our plans of where we would invest in price because we don't want to announce to our competitors where we plan to become more competitive. So we hold that very close to our vest. 
Stacie  Rabinowitz: Are you seeing anything so far as the gas prices are dropping in terms of shifts in where consumers are being more or less price-sensitive? 
J. Schlotman: Not in any big way. 
Operator: Our next question is from -- the last question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: I'll ask another natural foods question. I think you mentioned earlier on that you're seeing more conversions, people who weren't shopping, customers who weren't shopping the category coming into it. So  I want you to -- if you would, if you could, on some of your segmentation work, kind of elaborate on -- is that segment sort of driving the current growth you're seeing? And then contrast that to maybe folks who are already shopping the department and the penetration rates. And the third category, if you would address it, is there's been a prevailing theory for a long time, that consumer markets like Kroger would kind of see the natural food shopper and then, at some point, if they really converted to that lifestyle, would lose them to Whole Foods or an independent or somebody who could fulfill their whole basket. So I don't know if you're willing to talk about it, but are you trying to address that? I mean, are you seeing as they get to some point like hey, half their basket is this, and all of a sudden, they drop out? So if you would address that question, that'd be terrific to hear your response. 
J. Schlotman: Well, there's about 4 questions in the question. But the last piece, the folks that we have converted, I think if we can continue to offer the products selection at the prices they're willing to pay, I think we can maintain them. I don't have data that really supports if they leave and go to competitors, but some of the things we're doing around the country with vitamin shops in our stores and really well-done, expanded natural food selection offering -- and we've worked really hard on price in the whole natural and organic area too. So we are the #2 retailer for natural and organic sales today. And we just kind of continue to push hard. We love that customer, and they're really a great customer for us. 
W. McMullen: Andy, you shouldn't expect us to willingly give up any customer. And when you look at the products that a lot of the natural food competitors offer, you can find the exact same item at Kroger and, as a general rule, at very good value. Do you want to add? 
J. Schlotman: Just the last piece is, it's a large and growing segment of people who are trying to eat healthier, but they want to do so at a reasonable price. And I think, historically, it hasn't been that way. And today, you can shop for natural and organic and do it at a fairly reasonable price, and we're really trying to continue to make that offering, both selection and price. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. Just to follow up because I know it was a long question, what about this trend you cited for -- is there an acceleration in new users, folks who are dabbling for the first time in... 
J. Schlotman: Definitely. There are people moving into the category, new customers entering natural, organic and healthy foods all the time. And again, a lot of it's because selection is better, I think, for us, and pricing is much stronger. 
W. McMullen: But it's kind of interesting. Some of the -- a large part of our customers that switch over is because some items, they think, taste better. So it actually is driven by the taste. And in some situations, it's driven by the innovation of the product. So it's not just exclusively people wanting to live and just buy and eat natural products and organics. It's much broader than that. It's one of things that we get excited about having a store that has a lot of flexibility in it is that we can change what's inside the store based on what the customer's needs are and how those change. So we're excited about the category, and we're excited about the potential even more. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And just on the guidance very quick. It's probably been asked, but I'll ask it again if it has. If you take out the gas this year and Harris Teeter's accretion, or at least you gave a range, it looks like you're coming in around the high end of the 8% to 11% secular growth or maybe at the high end or a little better for the core business x those 2. And if you look at guiding to next year towards the lower end, is it more normalization of sales trends and maybe inflation? Or more, hey gas is -- you can't budget gas at the same level as this year as you're just sort of putting out this broad look to the lower end as sort of early guidance? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, as I said earlier, if you were to look at -- if you were to strip out the core grocery business, it would be higher in the range. But when you add the fuel in, that's -- if fuel margins revert to the mean, it would be the fuel that's driving it down. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rodney McMullen for any closing remarks. 
W. McMullen: Thank you. Before we end today's call, I would like to say a few words about Dave Dillon, who is listening in this morning. All of you know Dave well, and this is his last official meeting as Kroger's Chairman. 
 Dave has been a friend and a leader to all of us and a mentor to many of us. Thousands of associates can relate to that comment. For me, personally, Dave has been a partner like no other. On behalf of the entire Kroger family, we wish Dave and his family all the best as they begin the next chapter together. Dave, thank you from all of us. 
 Finally, I'd like to share some thoughts about our associates listening in. During the next few weeks, there will be a lot of activity in our stores as we help customers prepare for their holiday celebrations. Thank you for helping make the holidays brighter for our customers and the communities we serve and live in. 
 During Kroger's season of giving, with your help and the help from our customers, we will donate 30 million meals to local food banks. Customers will have the opportunity to add their support by dropping change into coin boxes at check stands and donating nonperishable food in collection barrels in stores. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and each other. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your family. 
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2014-09-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings and Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2014 Investor Conference in Cincinnati, beginning on the evening of October 28 and ending early afternoon on October 29. Details will be coming soon and we are looking forward to seeing many of you then. 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Kroger achieved a strong and balanced second quarter. As we improved our connection with customers, we are also executing our growth plan and delivering on our key performance indicators, all of which is fueling strong financial results for our shareholders. Our second quarter performance highlights Kroger's continued growth momentum. 
 We continue to deliver on the performance targets we outlined at our October 2012 Investor Conference, including: positive identical store sales growth; slightly expanding rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel; and improving return on invested capital.
 For the period, we achieved our 43rd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and we increased our return on invested capital, while also increasing capital investment. Based on our strong quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share guidance and our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. We expect to deliver a net earnings per diluted share growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal 2014. As you know, this is partially due to the benefit of Harris Teeter. We expect to return to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in fiscal 2012 -- 2015, sorry. Thanks, Cindy. 
 And we are not done growing and differentiating to better serve our customers. We are proud to welcome the incredible Vitacost.com team to The Kroger family. We are excited about the opportunity the merger creates to transform the customer experience and move Kroger directly into the e-commerce space much faster than we could have done on our own. The merger closed last month and our teams are hard at work developing our combined business plan. Mike Ellis will have more to say about Vitacost in a few minutes. 
 Our merger with Harris Teeter is going very well and we are learning a lot from each other and we can't say enough great things about our Harris Teeter associates.
 We continue to see positive indicators in customer shopping behavior, both what our customers tell us and what their actual shopping behavior says. Kroger's data suggests some greater confidence in the economy and less caution in spending, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Even so, confidence in the economy and the economic recovery is not pervasive across the board. Many of our customers are still struggling and we continue to pursue our strategy of connecting meaningfully with all customers, wherever they are in the economic spectrum. 
 It is worth noting that our definition of a loyal customer is based on a combination of how often a customer shops with us and the amount of products they purchase from Kroger. We have loyal customers in every segment of the customer spectrum, from value customers to upscale shoppers and everywhere in between. 
 We continue to see our loyal households grow at a faster rate than total households. As you know, we developed the 4 Keys of our Customer 1st Strategy more than 10 years ago because we recognized that customers wanted a grocery retailer that would deliver not just 1 or 2 key advantages, but a total combination, including a great overall shopping experience, excellent customer service, a full assortment of both national and corporate brand products and everyday low prices and promotional offerings. 
 Today, our customer research tells us that this is even more important. Our customers don't want to compromise by choosing retailers who do only well in only 1 or 2 areas. In short, customers are looking for a food retailer that can offer it all and that is Kroger's sweet spot. That is exactly where we've positioned ourselves to win, it is where we are winning and it is where we intend to continue to win. 
 Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our associates for their solid performance. Strong and consistent execution is what allows us to continue making investments in all the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, including investments in our associates and ongoing price investment.
 As Rodney said, loyal households grew at a faster rate than total households, which also grew for the quarter. This is important because it tells us that we are connecting with our customers across the entire spectrum and that we are connecting in the right areas: people, products and shopping experience and price. 
 As expected, inflation continued to increase during the quarter, especially in meat, dairy and in pharmacy, which continued to produce solid growth in both script count and ID sales. We estimate inflation, excluding fuel and pharmacy, was 2.4% in the second quarter and 2.8% with pharmacy. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the second quarter.
 Our corporate brands portfolio continues to resonate with our customers. During the second quarter, our corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of total units sold and 25.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. We saw strong double-digit unit and sales growth in Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics. Our new entry-level price point brands and premium tier Private Selection brand all had strong positive sales and unit gains in the second quarter as well.
 Another driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have highlighted innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I would like to focus on our merger with Vitacost.com. 
 First, I'd like to echo Rodney's welcome to the Vitacost team. You're now part of team Kroger and we couldn't be more excited about that. This is a compelling transaction because of the incredible potential for transformation and growth. We believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to blend the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience. Vitacost people and extensive e-commerce platform, coupled with Kroger's customer insights and loyal customer base, will really be a powerful combination that we can leverage to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers. We intend to build on Vitacost's robust technology platform and integrate it with our existing digital footprint to do just that. 
 This is one of the reasons we recently asked Kevin Dougherty, who has been serving as Kroger's Group Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, to lead this effort in a new role as Group Vice President of Digital and Vitacost. Kevin has been a leader on the Vitacost merger team from the beginning and, for the past several years, he has been increasingly focused on building our digital organization here at Kroger. We look forward to combining our teams to do great things for our customers together.
 Now I'd like to provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations, covering Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Cincinnati and Dayton. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in New Mexico, Toledo and agreements with the teams just covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. 
 Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and will enhance job security for our associates.
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 Investor Conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. 
 Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We're very pleased with our second quarter ID sales growth of 4.8%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department in every supermarket division. Our natural foods department continues to grow in the double digits, accelerated by significant household gains. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 7 basis points. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth rate, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.
 The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, excluding adjustment items of 13.6%, which was an increase from 13.5% in the same period last year. Increased capital investments will make it more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term, however, we expect these investments to be accretive to ROIC as they mature. We expect our year-end ROIC, which will factor in a full year of increased capital investments and fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to show a slight decline compared to the end of fiscal 2013.
 Now I'll share our second quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter and Kroger's statement of operations, so year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. 
 In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $347 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $317 million or $0.60 per diluted share. As Mike said, we are seeing higher inflation than originally anticipated. We recorded a $26 million LIFO charge during the quarter, compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating LIFO for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million. As reported this morning, we are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $100 million, which is an incremental $0.01 charge to net earnings per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 for the full year.
 As we have mentioned in the past, we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge and many of the items we discussed are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for every given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. Typically, a higher LIFO charge would be a headwind to results, but our strong sales helped us overcome the higher-than-expected charge and increase our guidance. FIFO gross margin decreased 12 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. 
 Operating, general and administrative costs, plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, were essentially flat as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Increases in workers' compensation and general liability reserves negatively affected this comparison by 8 basis points.
 Now for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.18 compared to $0.165 in the same quarter last year. 
 Our long-term financial strategy continues to be: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Achieving the 2x to 2.2x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has not yet final -- realized a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA. This has caused a significant increase in the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.33x as of the close of the second quarter compared to 1.77x during the same period last year. This is, however, an improvement from the 2.42x we reported last quarter.
 Kroger's net total debt is $11.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from a year ago. This includes the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and the share repurchases activity so far this year. Kroger's strong financial position allow the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.6 million common shares for a total investment of $78 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization in June, granted in June, is still available.
 Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $672 million for the second quarter compared to $507 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter for fiscal 2014.
 Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2014. Based on our strong second quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.22 to $3.28 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance remains 8% to 11% and shareholder return will be further enhanced by dividend expected to increase over time.
 We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3.5% to 4.25% for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was 3% to 4%. We are optimistic, as we look forward to the remainder of the year but, keep in mind, we had a very strong fourth quarter last year to compare to.
 Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. As I've said this before, this is an exciting time to be at Kroger. We are accelerating growth in our core business and investing in unique competitive positioning for today and the future. Integration with Harris Teeter is going exactly the way we would hope and we continue to learn from each other in ways to improve our customers' experiences. We see transformational potential in Vitacost's e-commerce platform. We are currently hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 positions in our supermarket stores. Next week, we will open our 2,000th fuel center location and we are well on our way to exceeding our long-term earnings per share growth rate for fiscal 2014.
 Now we look forward to answering your questions. Laura, we'll take our questions now. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: So 2 questions. Number one, how much of the inflation that you saw in the quarter do you think actually passed through? Maybe, on a percent basis, did you pass 50% of it through or 75%? What's the general thought there? And then given your -- around your comments about the economy, I would think you probably could get a lot more of that pass-through here in the third quarter or is that not right? 
W. McMullen: Yes, on your second question, I wouldn't necessarily agree or disagree with that. And as you know, inflation is -- you really do have to look at it item by item. And as Mike mentioned, even with the inflation, we still had strong tonnage growth and we're very happy with the results in total. A lot of the inflation right now is in some of the perishable areas, the fresh departments and that, as you know, is very seasonal. And if you look at, like, some of the produce inflation, as soon as the next crop comes on, that can heavily impact it. On percentage, I would hesitate to give it because in some areas, we feel comfortable we probably passed 100%, others, not so. And as you know, overall, as I mentioned, tonnage is strong. We continue to reduce our pricing for our customers as we take cost out of the business to do that. 
Steven Forbes: Okay. And then, secondly, so if you think about Harris Teeter, how much scope is there for that organization to accelerate unit growth? I know there's a lot of potential for new stores, but -- and I don't know if that's spread out over more years, can they accelerate unit growth? And if they can't, if there's the capacity to do that, given the lead time on real estate, when would that be? Is that a '16 or '17 time frame or sooner? 
J. Schlotman: John, I think you'll see Harris Teeter have a little bit higher store growth over the next several years than they otherwise would have. They had a lot of projects in the pipeline as the 2 companies came together with the merger and the nice thing about joining Kroger for them is it gives them a little bit more capital capacity to be a little faster on getting some of those store projects up and running. It is true, in many of the markets they operate, where we have growth opportunities, the D.C. area, the Baltimore area, markets like that, the lead time is a little bit longer, but they've always had a very strong and forward-thinking capital plan. It's really just the ability now for them to accelerate some of those a little faster than they may have on their own. So we would expect that their unit growth will kick up from where it has been historically. 
W. McMullen: [indiscernible] average, the lead time is probably, what, 1 to 2 years longer than what we've been traditionally used to, unless you go to the West Coast. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
Operator: And our next question will come Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: So I wanted to dive a little deeper into your expenses for the quarter. So compared to the past few quarters, we saw less expense leverage and I know you guys called out the more difficult comparison. Was there anything else that was unusual this quarter? And were the expenses in line with your internal plans? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, they were generally in line with our internal plans. The item that we called out in both -- well, that I just spoke of in the conference call, some increases in workers' comp and general liability reserves, a little bit of increase for this year, as well as some prior year increases in the allowances for that caused about an 8-basis-point negative effect on the OG&A lines. So we would've had a little bit better improvement or we would've shown some improvement if not for the need to increase those allowances. And I can tell you, that is certainly a point of focus for our operators and our loss prevention folks. The key to that isn't the dollars, it's making sure the accidents never happen. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. And then shifting to e-commerce, we've seen a lot more noise lately, whether it's from Amazon or Whole Foods and some of your competitors and you guys have clearly made investments with Vitacost. I mean, how do you feel about your current capabilities versus the competition right now? 
W. McMullen: It's a good question. I would say we feel very good, but we're not satisfied. And the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel increasingly happy about what we're seeing. As you know, it's one of the things when we merged with Harris Teeter that we were really excited about. They have an incredibly strong click and collect operation that we're spending a lot of time on. And as you know, when we announced merging with Vitacost, they have a great group of people from a talent perspective and a great infrastructure that we think we can grow off and expand. So I feel very comfortable where we are positioned from a food standpoint relative to our competition. I feel even more excited about some of the things that we've put in place to take advantage of the future. Mike or Mike, do you want to add to that? 
Michael Ellis: Nothing, other than the fact that the merger just closed a month ago and we are working hard to bring both companies together and see all the benefits we can come up with here. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: I just wanted to dive a little bit into gross margins. So obviously, there's been a lot of news and press about Harris Teeter taking prices down and it's hard to know how much that would've impacted your gross margins on your P&L. But by my math, your core FIFO margins, excluding Harris Teeter, could actually have been up this quarter. Is that a fair statement? And then, I guess, maybe talk about how generics might have impacted your gross margin and other points that might be relevant. 
J. Schlotman: Relative to Harris Teeter, I won't go to that level of transparency. Harris Teeter is not the only place that we continue to invest in price. They've -- it's been fairly public about the price reductions they've done and where they've done them, but we continue to refine our pricing strategy in all the geographies we operate. And our goal always remains to grow our operating profit margin on a rolling 4-quarter basis slightly. We were 7 basis points and I've never given a specific number, although Rodney and Cindy both pitted me a little bit yesterday that I've always said, "By that, it's a handful or less," and most people can count how many digits are on both of my hands. And it would be only 1 hand, not 2. So that's why we said we actually exceeded that goal a little bit this time and that's what we always focus on. And when we get the operating leverage, we can accelerate things that we plan to do later. And if things aren't quite trending the way we want to grow operating profit margin, we can slow a few things down. We've become very nimble on that arena, which has been a huge help. 
Karen Short: Okay. So then, just on your quarter, in general, did you guys -- you guys came in above plan in the second quarter, is that fair to say? And then, I guess, it was ahead of plan on earnings. Was that more gas margin related? And I guess, I'm wondering because you didn't beat the Street by much, but your gross margins came in quite a bit higher and yet, you're raising your full year guidance on the low end by $0.03, so... 
J. Schlotman: I think it's a combination of things, Karen. The strong sales, certainly, are encouraging for us and that momentum is always good. If you look at everything that has happened and the fact that we've increased our LIFO charge by what will amount to $0.05 or $0.06 more charge than we expected at the beginning of the year, we've now raised our earnings guidance twice, we've now raised our ID sales guidance. It's the combination of those factors that has allowed us to remain quite positive. While we only beat the Street by $0.01, LIFO cost us $0.01 and the 8 basis points from workers' comp and general liability would've been somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02, probably, at least, $0.02, depending on how things round. So despite those headwinds, the underlying strength of our core businesses, we're very happy with it. 
Karen Short: And the top line strength has continued into the third quarter? 
W. McMullen: Yes. So far, through the third quarter, it's very similar to where we were in the first and second quarters and I'm pleased with the continued progress. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: If we look at the P&L just for the third quarter, are there any Vitacost acquisition expenses worth calling out, Mike? 
J. Schlotman: We haven't really called out any merger-related expenses for Harris Teeter for a while. We had some, actually leading up to the merger, there's been a few small ones out there, nothing amounting to much of anything, although a lot of the heavy lifting on -- as we convert systems and maybe happened to write some of the assets off of their books that they have capitalized as we convert to our systems. Those things might face us in the future. But those aren't cash expenditures, they're things that were spent in the past. And Vitacost is just so new. Sure, there was a handful of expenses leading up to the merger. While we used outside counsel, we didn't use an outside financial advisor, so it's not like we had any kind of a fee to pay a third party in that. So there really wasn't much at all. 
Charles Cerankosky: And then, in your guidance for the remainder of the year, Mike, how much dilution from Vitacost is built into that number? 
J. Schlotman: It's negligible for the back half of the year and it's certainly contemplated in our guidance. They were actually operating here, very recently, at very close to a breakeven kind of a level. And we have a little bit of dilution built in, but nothing dramatic that we don't think we can overcome with the strength of the underlying operations. 
Charles Cerankosky: So something like less than $0.05 per share? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, sir. 
W. McMullen: Less than a handful of pennies. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe research. 
Scott Mushkin: Most of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to delve into the balance sheet. Mike, I know you talked about 2.33x and your 1.7x -- and I probably got the numbers all messed up, but you want to get them -- you want to get down to 2x. But clearly, there's been a lot of activity in the space. I just wonder, from your perspective, does your balance sheet right now preclude you from doing other things? Or would it -- it's a factor? Or how are you thinking about your balance sheet, given the fact that there's been so much activity in the space vis-à-vis M&A? 
J. Schlotman: We were 1.77x last year and we were at 2.33x this year, which was 9 basis points down from the first quarter. We feel very comfortable we're on track to get to the 2x to 2.2x. We'll be happy at the high-end of the range. We don't necessarily have to get to the 2.0x, Scott. That's just the range we winded up giving. I don't know that our balance sheet necessarily precludes us from doing anything. If the right opportunity is out there and we go to the rating agencies and they understand the uniqueness of an opportunity, like they clearly did with Harris Teeter, and our follow-through, when we make a commitment to them that we actually follow through on what we do, whether it's how we expect to grow the dividend, how we expect to use cash flow to buy in shares, how we expect to use capital to grow our business organically, we're very open with the rating agencies and follow through on the commitments we make. And if it's the right set of assets with the right growth opportunity, like Harris Teeter was with all the new markets, I don't think we would be precluded from continuing to participate in industry consolidation. 
W. McMullen: The other thing is the 1.77x was unusually low because we had stopped buying back stocks and some other things because we had already announced the Harris Teeter merger and we wanted to position ourself well to being able to merge with Harris Teeter. 
J. Schlotman: That's an excellent point. We were actually out of the market on shares for quite a while, as we were blacked out while we were looking at it as well. So it was a combination of factors. 
Scott Mushkin: That's perfect. And if I could have one more. I think you guys recently opened up 121,000 square-foot in Athens, Georgia and I think the comments and what I've read is that there's a bigger one to come down there. You guys are really the only ones opening up bigger stores, even Walmart is shrinking what they're trying to do. Can you kind of give us a reason why you're so comfortable with opening up these large stores and what you see what maybe other people don't see? 
Michael Ellis: Well, we've had good success with our marketplace format. It is driving a lot of our sales and growth right now. So really pleased with how they're performing, although we are still working on small-format stores. We're doing some work and research around that. So we're really trying to stay open to what's the customers looking for in terms of shopping experience. And so far, they've been really pleased with the selection that we have in the big store and we're really pleased with the results. 
W. McMullen: When we look at our Customer 1st tracker, customers can -- rate us very high in our marketplace stores. So it's really the things -- the combination of our associates and their connection with our customers and what we've put inside those boxes really connect well with the customer. And I realize 120,000 square feet, it depends on where you start from, it's a good-sized store but it's not so big that you can't manage getting around the store reasonably easy either. And it just gives you a lot of flexibility from a space utilization standpoint. And obviously, the key is making sure what you put in is exciting and something the customer wants. 
Operator: And the next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Sinisi: Wanted to ask a little bit more about Harris Teeter, if you guys can give further color in terms of the order online pick up at store capability that, obviously, was one of the big draws from Harris Teeter. Where are you in that process today? And any color that you can give in terms of, maybe, as you roll that capability out further? 
W. McMullen: It's still pretty early in the process. I can tell you that our teams have spent a ton of energy, but it's not something that we are to a point of announcing publicly. But I can tell you, we're progressing along and we're very pleased with where we are and we're very pleased with the progress that Harris Teeter continues to make as well. I don't know, Mike, if you'd like to... 
Vincent Sinisi: On the -- in the Harris Teeter brand itself, has there been further rollout? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Harris Teeter has continued to roll it out and they continue to have strong growth where they already have it. So it's really both pieces. 
Vincent Sinisi: Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, switching over to Vitacost. I know, obviously, also very early in the stages, but any color that you can give in terms of, when it was announced, you said that of the 45,000 SKUs that Vitacost carries, you had about 10,000 overlap. Any work that's been done so far that you can just kind of incrementally share in terms of maybe what some of those other products, when we may start to see them flowing onto the shelves throughout your banners, your other banners? 
Michael Ellis: Well, again, we just really closed the transaction and we're right in the middle of putting plans together and going through all of the steps that you would during a merger of this sort and size and really trying to develop our plans for the future and how do we grow the platform, the Vitacost business. And we're learning a lot from Vitacost on what to do within the Kroger footprint also. So we're still in that discovery phase, but there is a lot going on and we're learning every day that there's more to learn. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: For Rodney or Mike and Mike, the guidance obviously implies a little bit of a slowdown in the ID sales x fuel in the back half. Can you guys just maybe talk about what -- why IDs would slow? Would it -- and maybe what some of the support was? Is your expectation of support from fuel rewards potentially slowing? Is there an expectation of less benefit from inflation? Or is there an expectation that tonnage could slow? Just sort of any color we should think about as far as your opportunity to continue to beat those ID guidance you're giving us. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Robert. First of all, obviously, we're going to strive to make sure the identicals are as strong as we can. If you remember, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a lot of weather benefits. We didn't really talk about it that much in the earnings call, but there were quite a bit of weather benefits. Until you actually have it, you don't know whether it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind, so we're really -- the biggest reason for the conservatism in the identical guidance would be really cycling fourth quarter last year and not knowing how weather would be. It's really nothing -- you shouldn't read anything in it other than that. So we really don't see inflation changing that much. We really don't see the economy changing that much. We're not seeing the customer behavior changing either. 
Robert Ohmes: And then in terms of the sort of contribution from fuel rewards, has that been healthy? And is that expected to continue to incrementally support IDs as well? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question and it's a little harder to answer because it's hard to isolate just one piece and what it does for identicals. It's really the whole shopping experience. So we continue to make progress on the freshness of our product. Our associates continue to make progress on connecting with our customers from a friendliness standpoint. So it's really hard to say this piece of improvement causes this much to the identicals. Overall, as you know, it's just one more reason for somebody to shop at Kroger and it's part of the overall package of what we're trying to deliver for our customer. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO. 
Kelly Bania: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about category performance. I think you mentioned a little bit on private label, but I think if I'm correct -- or correct me if I'm wrong, that you had been trending with all departments, kind of, in the positive territory? So just curious if you had any update on that. 
Michael Ellis: It was a well-rounded quarter. Corporate brands had a very nice quarter. If there was any hiccup at all and it's not even a hiccup but, obviously, the high dairy prices has an influence on how many units of milk wind up getting sold. So that was a bit of headwind on corporate brands because so much of the milk that we sell is processed in our own dairies. But tonnage, overall, was very, very strong. All departments had positive ID sales. All geographies had positive ID sales. And once again, natural foods would have been the leader in the departments, with continued double-digit ID sales growth in that department. 
W. McMullen: Pharmacy was strong... 
Michael Ellis: Pharmacy was strong. 
W. McMullen: A lot of departments were strong. 
Michael Ellis: Good broad-based performance. 
W. McMullen: Meat, produce, et cetera. 
Kelly Bania: Great. That's very helpful. And then just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the science of the less cautious behavior that you're seeing and it sounds like most parts of your store. Is that more any trading-up activity? Is it more items you're seeing in the basket? Is it less focus on couponing and promotions? Or just any color you can provide would be helpful. 
Michael Ellis: Okay. Well, it's as much an art as it is a science, but it's really looking at things that would be discretionary, what kind of performance are we having there. So if you think about Starbucks or Boar's Head, some of our cheeses, some of our upscale items, customers continue to engage in that in a much more positive way than before. And that's performance that's year-on-year. Also, if you look at some of the nonfood, general, jewelry, all those types of discretionary items, customers continue to be willing to spend money. And then we also survey our customers on their perception and customers are continuing to tell us they feel the economy is a little bit better, but they continue to be nervous in terms of their outlook on things. So it's cautious optimism, I think, is probably the best way to put it. 
Operator: The next questioner is Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I have 2 questions, if I can. You slipped in a mention of D.C., Baltimore today. Can you update us on what your plan is for your expansion into new markets, where you're most focused? You're looking to hire 20,000 new permanent employees. Is that a sign you are getting closer to that? Or is that not the right way to look at the press release? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't say the 20,000 new hires really has anything to do with any announcement of going into new geography. Those are, by and large, almost entirely, if not incompletely, jobs that are open today in geographies where we already operate or have plans over the next year to open stores in existing geographies. So those are actual current needs we have to have to fully staff our stores at the level we want staffed and be able to have schedules written away. We need them written in our associates who want to work inside of our stores. We continue to think about our new market activity. A lot of activity going on around that, but we aren't going to be premature in announcing where that may be. 
W. McMullen: Obviously, merging with Harris Teeter put us in a lot of new markets. 
J. Schlotman: A lot of new markets. And relevant to the earlier question that I think John asked, we would expect, they're relatively new to D.C., Baltimore, so for Harris Teeter, those were new markets and there's significant opportunity to increase our footprint in those markets. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. And then the drought in California, it continues to become, I guess, more worrisome. So as you think about some of the fruits and nuts and so forth that you source from there, I mean, you look into next year, some of these items might be in shorter supply. Are you planning more differently than what you might usually do? Do you have options from other geographies if, I guess, certain items from the U.S. are harder to find? Or is it just too early to even think about that? 
W. McMullen: I think it's probably too early to think about that, although, we have the same sort of issue, whether it's orange juice from Florida or other commodities from around the world, that we'll have short supply from time to time and we just have to deal with that as best we can. And we buy from around the world in so many cases today, whether it's in the fresh departments or other parts of our business. So we just have to deal with that as it comes, I think. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities. 
Kate Wendt: So your natural and organic sales growth has remained, obviously, pretty consistent here and strong. I'm curious how you're thinking today about this notion that the industry may be reaching a point where there's too much supply at retail for demand? Or do you think, instead, that the piece of the pie in terms of people interested in natural and organic is only continuing to broaden and deepen? 
Michael Ellis: Well, it appears to us that the natural organic customer is changing and growing in numbers and those that shop the grocery store are also crossing over. And the blurring of grocery and natural foods is becoming more and more difficult when you look around the store and you can see organic items on the regular grocery shelf. So it seems that the customer base is getting much larger for these types of products. I don't know where the end is. I mean, it might be a lifestyle change for our customers that they're just deciding to eat better and make different choices for their families. But we love the growth and we're going to continue to make sure that we have the products our customers are looking for. 
W. McMullen: We don't find that customer as an either/or shopper. There's a small percentage of customers that are only organic and natural, but most of our customer base actually buys across the whole store. 
Kate Wendt: I guess that was my follow-up. Do you have any data that you can share on what percent of your customers are buying some natural or organics products today? And maybe how many just started over the past couple of years or maybe even what type of households were you seeing the most growth in the category in terms of whether it's middle incomes or upper middle incomes? Or anything that you can share on that would be really helpful. 
W. McMullen: It would be well over half of our customers would buy something. That continues to increase. And the thing that I think is so hard is there's a lot of product innovation in that space as well, so some of the customers may be buying products there because of the innovation, not necessarily because of organic or natural. It's just because it's a new item and it tastes good. So how much of it is driven by one piece versus the other, I think it's pretty -- it'd be pure speculation. 
Kate Wendt: Interesting. And anything in terms of the sort of household income profile, are you seeing that kind of dip down into middle incomes or where you're seeing kind of the most growth? 
W. McMullen: It's really all customer types. It's not exclusive to one specific customer, by no means. 
Operator: And our next question is from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi. 
Filippe Goossens: I actually have 2 questions this morning, if I may. First one is for Michael Schlotman. Michael, if I look at your outstanding debt, there's still a few items with high coupons. Can you maybe, conceptually, talk about how you think about liability management? And then, my question for Rodney is kind of a follow-up on an earlier question with regard to smaller store formats. We're obviously monitoring, with great interest, the Family Dollar saga. We're also monitoring what's going on in the U.K. market, where companies like Wm Morrison are now using convenience stores as a way to compete with the Aldis and the leaders of the world. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about the convenience store format? Is that something that, down the road, may be part of your plans? Or are you still very happy with your current portfolio? 
W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at the smaller stores, obviously, we've been in the convenience store itself for years and years and years. I came to Kroger when we merged with Dillon. We would look at -- we are following Dollar General, Family Dollar every day as well. We consider both of them competitors. I can tell you all of us get into those stores on a regular basis, trying to learn what they do and how they connect with their customer and what are they doing good and what can we learn from them. And we think it will be important, over time, to have even a smaller store that's part of the profile, that's probably a convenient store and not necessarily a convenience store. But it's something we continue to work on. We haven't figured out how to make money the way we'd like to make money there, but we haven't given up either. Mike, do you want to talk about the debt? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, from a liability management standpoint, Filippe, we constantly look at some of those higher-coupon pieces of debt that are out there. Many of those are 30-year debt or what was 30-year debt at the time we issued it. When we look at the net present value of making a tender offer for those, it just doesn't often come out where it's an NPV positive on a cash flow basis. It may help accretion, it may be accretive to earnings per share on that basis, but the upfront amount you have to pay because of the premium that they'd be trading at, you wind up spending a lot of cash upfront. So we'll constantly look at it. I wouldn't say we have any plans in the near term to do anything about them and our approach has been, over time, to continue to manage our liability and have dollars coming due every year so we can be accessing the markets on a regular basis. We've actually taken a few hundred basis points out of our average interest portfolio. When we look at upcoming debt issuance activity, we do oftentimes enter into hedging agreements to lock in current interest rates in advance of actually issuing the debt. As we get closer to those, that is a type of transaction we often use. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Your comments that the recovery has not really been pervasive across the board, if you also look across the discounters that have not been showing strong grocery performance, it sounds like the weakness is really in that lowest income customer bracket. Is that true? And can you give us some insights on what's going on with that group? Are they just not responding to lower pricing at this point? 
W. McMullen: Well, I would say that we're very happy with how we're connecting with that customer. If you look at their economic situation, incomes have been very slow to recover and employment has been slow to recover. So it's really, when I make the comment, it's referring to the situation therein and we continue to try to make sure that we're able to address pricing and help their budget go further, both on the introduction of more entry price point items and, absolutely, just lowering pricing, too. So we're very happy with our performance for that customer segment, but that customer segment continues to be under a lot of economic strain. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay, great. And then, switching over to store growth. You've done a lot of consolidation of underperforming stores in recent years and that's put some pressure on your net store growth. But it sounds like you're coming to some end of that process. Is there a square footage growth rate you can commit to in future years that's a little more robust? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I incorrectly predicted last year that our asset, Harris Teeter, that our unit growth would expand a little bit. So I'll probably be hesitant to repeat that great prognostication here. Obviously, we've been very aggressive on trimming some of the underperforming assets in our portfolio, which has slowed our store count. The question earlier on, in Athens, Georgia, opening it up at 121,000 square feet, there are times -- that was not the case, but there are times where we open a store like that and then may replace a couple of 40,000 or 50,000 square foot stores. So our square footage actually goes up, but our store count goes down by 1 as a result. I think, going forward, our guidance has been in the range of a couple of percent of square footage growth excluding the operational closings and I don't want to get married to a square footage growth on a net basis and not make the right decision on operationally closing a store, so we kind of look at our investments in new, relocated and expanded stores separately from what activities should happen on operational closings and look at those separately. So we continue to increase capital. We'll increase it a couple of hundred million dollars next year. We expect to open up more stores next year than this year and I think it will be a continued progression up in both our store count and our square footage. 
Mark Wiltamuth: So improving, but something under 2%, it sounds like. 
J. Schlotman: On a net basis, I would think so, yes. But Mark, keep in mind, that square footage is significantly more productive when you look at it on a sales per square footage basis. We're up roughly 50% on improvement in productivity in our stores since we started this Customer 1st journey 10 years ago. At the end of the day, I'd rather have more highly -- more productive square footage than more square footage that's a little less productive. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And then lastly, as you're looking at click and collect and some of the other models, maybe if you can comment a little on some of these personal shopping services that are out there from third parties. Have you looked into Instacart, into Google Express and some of these other ones that are out there? What are your thoughts there? 
W. McMullen: Yes, you should be very comfortable that we've looked at all of them and it's really trying to make sure we understand what our customers' wants and needs are. Some of the places where we believe that will be more successful are places where we don't have stores, but it is something we continue to look at and evaluate and look at partnering with, as appropriate. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I wanted to go back to comments about ROIC and the fact that there are a lot of investments, not just including Harris Teeter, but other investments that are dampening it now, but we will see improvement. And I was just wondering if you can give us a better sense of, not specific numbers, but kind of in terms of magnitude, whether we're talking about remodels, new stores and then a sense of how we should expect the benefits of those investments to flow in? Is it going to be 2015? Or is there more in 2016? Just how is that all going to work out? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, Meredith. If absent the Harris -- Harris Teeter being in there for a full year this year and if you think about how an ROIC calculation works and we started to go down this path in the conference call and took the language out, so I guess I'll go down on that in the Q&A. Right now, we only have half of the Harris Teeter assets in the calculation because it's the beginning of the year and end of the year average assets that your return is calculated on. So right now, it's about half year's of EBITDA and half of their assets. If you think about an ROIC number for Harris Teeter based on the purchase price, it would've been an ROIC number below what Kroger had been generating. So a full year of Harris Teeter in here will reset the bar for ROIC slightly. It won't be dramatically lower, but we do expect it to be a little bit lower. Absent that, even with the increased CapEx we've been investing in the business, we would've expected ROIC to grow slightly, albeit somewhat slowly as we ramped this up. You typically see a couple to 3-year lag and a better growth of ROIC as you begin to increase your capital expenditures. So we're about midway into that 2- to 3-year time frame. So sometime in '15, '16, we should start to see a bigger benefit from those investments we've made 18 months ago and are starting to mature now and they'll overwhelm the new investments we make in '15 and '16 from a return standpoint. 
W. McMullen: Typically, on expansions in these stores, Mike, the first year actually hurts ROIC. 
J. Schlotman: Absolutely. 
W. McMullen: The second year, it gets almost neutral, but it hurts a little. Third year, it starts helping. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
W. McMullen: If you look at the level of maturity. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. And when you look at the performance of the projects that you've done, are they all following the pro formas that you had built? Are you -- do you feel like they're -- or are they beating them? 
J. Schlotman: Well, it's like anything, all would be an overstatement of all hitting that or overperforming. It's a mixed bag. Some are a little below, some are exceeding it in a big way. But, by and large, most of them, many of them are right at the kind of expectations we laid out. The key there will be to continue to generate the sales and the EBITDA that those stores were expected to generate and then, in turn, hold our divisions accountable to give that EBITDA back to our shareholders and either back to us to continue to invest in the business or back to the shareholders so we can grow it. But clearly, as a group, these stores are performing very well and, I would say, are at a point right now of exceeding our expectations as a group. 
Meredith Adler: And then my final question would be, is it right to think about this level of investment as being something that will continue? I know you don't want to talk about moving into a new market. Or should we see this as sort of opportunistic and we'll see a moderation in, say, '17? 
J. Schlotman: I would not expect to see a moderation in the capital plans. We've got some great markets where we have average market shares or below average market shares when you look at some of our stronger markets. And the strong connection we see between market share and return on invested capital is one of the reasons we've gone down the fill-in strategy format. And I would expect to continue to see us have a very strong capital expenditure program. When we laid it out in 2012, we expected this to -- a couple of hundred million dollar increase for 5 years and it was going to start in '13. So that really gets you to the '17, '18 kind of time frame. And as we go through that process, we'll go through the report card like you just asked on the stores we've opened. And to the extent we continue to be happy with those investments as a group because, in the end, that's what affects our shareholders, is the group, we'll make ongoing decisions about how much we'll invest in capital. But based on where we are right now, I don't see any cause for pause. 
Operator: And that question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: So as we -- I guess, just following up on Kate's questions earlier on natural and organics, you mentioned innovation as a big part of some of the growth you're seeing in the channel and the response from the consumer. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the number of SKUs you've added in these categories, what additional rollouts are still planned and maybe, how much of the sales you think has been incremental? And then, kind of as a corollary there, how do you think about margin associated with this category versus other areas of the store? 
Michael Ellis: Well, in terms of incremental, it's hard to say. There's a lot of switching that goes on today between natural and basic type of products. As we've mentioned, we expect our Simple Truth brand to be a $1 billion brand this year. So customers are as interested today and as engaged in natural and organic as they've ever been. Also, we don't talk a lot about organic produce, but that's a category that continues to grow. Could probably grow faster if supply was better, but we continue to enjoy large sales growth in that particular area. 
Stephen Grambling: And so just, again, on the -- I guess, any additional SKUs that you're planning to roll out on top of what you've done already? And also how you think about the margin in these categories, I guess, now and going forward? 
Michael Ellis: SKU count continue to increase and the departments continue to grow in many cases, both on the private label side as well as the branded side. Margins, I'll tell you what, there's more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there's ever been. It seems that it's becoming more and more of a competitive category. And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic, I don't know if that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. 
W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the anniversary of the attacks of September 11. We all continue to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who perished on that tragic day. And I know that many of the folks on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to honor the memory of the fallen through our support of police, firefighters, the military and their families. On behalf of all of us here at Kroger, we want to say our heartfelt thank you to the everyday heroes who work every day to keep us all safe.
 Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. September is Hunger Action Month and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our associates across the company who help support our customers and neighbors in need. According to our partners at Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger agency, there are 46.5 million Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from. Together, we are working to combat poverty, in partnership with 106 local Feeding America food banks. 
 Last year alone, Kroger contributed the equivalent of 200 million, that's right, 200 million meals, nearly 4 million meals every week, to feed hungry families in our community, which I just find an amazing number and my hats off to our team.
 Of that, our Perishable Donations Partnership Program provided more than 50 million pounds of fresh meat, produce, dairy and bakery items directly to local food banks in 2013. Our associates play a vital role in helping us get this fresh, healthy food to those who need it most. Without your help and support, our Perishable Donations partnership would not be possible. Thank you.
 That completes our call for today and thanks for joining us. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q1  (2014-06-19 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Kroger delivered an outstanding first quarter. It is a great start to what we believe will be another exceptional year. Our associates continue to enhance our connection with all customers and achieve key performance measures, which are allowing us to achieve our growth strategy. We also achieved our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, maintained a steady return on invested capital while increasing capital investment. We are achieving synergies from our merger with Harris Teeter. Both Mikes will have more to say about this in a few minutes. And we returned over $1 billion in cash back to our shareholders this quarter through our buyback program.
 The staying power of our Customer 1st strategy and our accelerated growth plan are generating strong momentum. We continue to lower our cost of doing business and to invest those savings both for today's customers and for future growth. Our strong first quarter results set us up to deliver a 12% to 15% net earnings per share growth rate for the year, partly due to the benefit of Harris Teeter, compared to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% plus the dividend in both cases.
 I'm also pleased to report that we continue to take meaningful steps to restructure and help secure our associates' pension obligations for the future. Through 2 innovative agreements, we plan to move nearly 2,000 associates and retirees to more stable pension plans and 350 associates to a Kroger-sponsored 401(k) plan with a match. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard our associates' benefits. We are always looking for opportunities that are good for our associates, good for Kroger and good for our shareholders.
 From an economy and customer shopping behavior, we are seeing strong positive indicators in shopping behavior. Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behavior, for example. Consistent with the rise in consumer confidence index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery. While it is obviously welcome news, the recovery remains fragile, especially for customers on a budget. We intend to keep delivering value and improving our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether through our popular fuel rewards program, our Simple Truth offerings or a more convenient shopping experience, Kroger is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise in any economic environment. And against this backdrop, an uneven economic recovery, our team's excellent first quarter performance stands out in even greater contrast.
 Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to congratulate the entire Kroger team for executing our Customer 1st strategy with precision in the first quarter, which is driving growth and improving our perception in the eyes of our customers. We are connecting better with our customers, showing them we care and making sure they have a great shopping experience every time.
 Keeping costs down allowed us to invest strategically and increase customer loyalty. During the quarter, we grew our number of loyal households at a much faster rate than total household growth, which also was up for the quarter. We saw inflation increase in the grocery category during the quarter. This, combined with higher inflation in meat, produce and pharmacy, has caused us to adjust our view of inflation for the year. We estimate inflation excluding pharmacy was 1.8% in the first quarter and 2.1% with pharmacy included. We expect it to be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year as well. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the first quarter. 
 I'll jump to Harris Teeter. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going extremely well. We are spending time with Harris Teeter and learning a lot about how they connect with customers. Their store standards and fresh foods are world-class, and our cultures are a great fit, which makes our integration work rather easy. We are excited about what we're learning about Harris Teeter's online ordering and store pickup model. It's a program with a lot of promise. 
 A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. Each quarter, we are highlighting one or more of our innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I will highlight some of the new exciting work of our corporate brands and Kroger technology teams. In corporate brands, a strategic differentiator for Kroger's corporate brand portfolio is our multi-tier offering. It allows us to offer the right price points and product experiences for everyone. In the first quarter, we introduced new branding and packaging for our value products, the good tier of our "good, better, best" program. The new design calls out to customers with attractive, uplifting packaging, and the response, so far, has been really terrific. For fresh products, we've replaced Kroger Value with Heritage Farm. The name better reflects the inherent quality of the brand, and we are already seeing positive acceptance from our customers. Corporate brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.2% of total units sold and 24.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 Kroger technology is our team of technology innovators and inventors. They are implementing a fundamental foundational technology that we can leverage to create the Internet of Things in the retail environment. One tangible example of this is real-time temperature monitoring in our supermarkets. Today, temperature checks are performed manually by our associates, but by using interactive sensors that are connected through an in-store network, we can better ensure the freshest foods by allowing for more frequent, real-time temperature checks of meat, produce, deli and frozen food products. Now we love these kinds of initiatives because they save money and they free up time for our associates to engage with customers. And most importantly, this technology will help improve our already vigorous food safety efforts. We plan to continue leading the adoption of the Internet of Things in our stores.
 Now I'll give a brief update on labor negotiations, labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Atlanta and Southern California, as well as for nonfood associates in Portland, Oregon. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Cincinnati, New Mexico, Toledo and parts of California and an agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective: knowing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates.
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing to deliver shareholder value through our share buyback program and dividend.
 When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter ID sales growth of 4.6%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and general merchandise departments also posted strong ID sales growth, and Kroger's pharmacy department continued its strong performance.
 Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin on a 52-week basis, excluding fuel and the pension agreements, increased by 12 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. Until we have Harris Teeter in both the current and base years, the expected increase will be higher than our long-term guidance, which is slightly expanding. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.
 The third metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters basis of 13.5%, which is consistent with ROIC during the same period last year. As we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. As Mike and Rodney already said, our integration with Harris Teeter is well underway, and we're achieving synergies in multiple fronts. One great example is combining insurance programs, which has reduced our annual premiums by $6 million already.
 Now I'll share our first quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this is the first period that includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's statement of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $501 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as described in yesterday's press release. Excluding the effect of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the first quarter. Net earnings in the same period last year were $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share.
 As Mike Ellis said, we are seeing higher inflation than anticipated. We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $17 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $90 million. Our previous LIFO guidance for the fiscal year was a charge of $55 million. This affects the year by about $0.04. FIFO gross margin increased 1 basis point from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, declined 9 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's first quarter.
 Now for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.131 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment-grade rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Kroger remains committed to achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015. 
 Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and realized no incremental EBITDA in fiscal 2013 because the transaction closed late in the fiscal year. This has a material effect on the company's net total debt to EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.42x compared to 1.85x during the same period last year. As we get a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA in the calculation, we expect to be closer to 2.2x by the end of the year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago. This is a result of the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase activity.
 Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 25.7 million common shares for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $709 million for the first quarter compared to $600 million -- $640 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014.
 Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings guidance to a range of $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. The original guidance was $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth remains -- our guidance remains at 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3% to 4% for fiscal 2014, including Harris Teeter. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%. 
 And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. What a terrific start to our year. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going exceptionally well. We are learning a lot from Harris Teeter associates, and our business is performing well. And we're even more excited about Harris Teeter's people and the opportunity today than we were when we first merged. Across our company, our associates' remarkably consistent execution continues to generate consistently remarkable results for our shareholders. We will continue building on this resilient foundation to grow aggressively into the future. 
 And now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So a couple of things. Obviously, it's a little hard to tell with Harris Teeter mixed into the numbers, but if I try to back that out and think about x fuel gross margin decline, it looks about what it's been running or maybe just slightly higher than it's been running. And I ask that because I'm curious what you see with regard to inflation today. Is that being passed along fairly quickly? Or given your value position, are you delaying some of that for weeks or maybe even months? 
W. McMullen: Yes, breaking it out, you would be correct that without Harris Teeter, the trends would be very similar to what they've been running. From an inflation standpoint, we pass it along, some of it in terms of, obviously, how's the competitive environment going and also, inflation that we think is just a seasonal-type inflation or something that's longer term. And I would say in our ability to pass it through, it's pretty much similar to what it's been running. I don't know, Mike or Mike, anything you want to add to that? 
Michael Ellis: No. 
J. Schlotman: No. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then as a follow-up, when I think about your price investments, right, and you're – I don't know what inning we're in, but how do you think about it now in terms of investing by category, right, because I know you made investments in natural foods. Are there more categories where you need that type of work? Doesn't look like there is. Or is it solely items? And then how do you think about private label, price investments in private label? And when you think about that, do you look at the private label spread versus the brand, or do you actually go out and look at what other retailers are retailing their private label products at? 
W. McMullen: Well, the first question on overall price investment, we're continuing to look at the markets we do business in and deciding where we want to be positioned. Also, we look at categories within the store and try to determine where we want to be priced relative to competition or the market. But private label, there's several ways we look at private label pricing. One would be how it's related to the branded product. And in some cases, it might be priced with the competition in a way that keeps us on our pricing strategy and keeps us relevant. It really depends upon the item and the market. 
John Heinbockel: But do you think -- we're talking about items now. Most of your category adjustments have been made, or do you disagree with that? 
W. McMullen: We've been through most categories and made some sort of adjustments over the last several years in pricing, but we're still looking at pricing overall and where we're positioned and making decisions on where we want to be. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Forgive me if you mentioned this. Can you estimate, even if it's just a rough number, what weather's tailwind was on your comps in 1Q? 
W. McMullen: Mike? 
J. Schlotman: It's really tough. If you look at the cadence of comps during the first quarter, the first 4 weeks of the quarter were a little bit stronger than the rest of the quarter but not remarkably high. In the second, third and fourth periods, the second and third were affected by the Easter shift. If you kind of normalize Easter between the 2 periods, they were very, very close to one another. So I don't think there was a huge bump in the first quarter as a result of weather. It certainly helped, but it's not what made the 4.6% strong. The second, third and fourth on a combined basis certainly contributed to the results as well. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. And then as we look at your comps into 2Q, any particular headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about? Just a little more color on how things are progressing so far this quarter. Just curious on those lines. 
W. McMullen: Yes, we wouldn't see anything unusual versus what it's been running, and we would continue to be slightly above our guidance range in terms of, so far, this quarter and very similar to the first quarter. 
Kenneth Goldman: One last quick one. It's a bit tricky because of the different days in the quarter and Harris Teeter. I just want to make sure. Your D&A was up 12% year-on-year. Your interest expense was up 14% year-on-year. Are these roughly the growth rates we should be modeling for the rest of the year on a year-on-year basis? 
W. McMullen: For the year on a year-on-year basis, yes. They will be in that kind of a range because of the Harris Teeter depreciation, as well as the debt we took on for Harris Teeter. And then obviously, next year, we'll return to a more normal level. The other one that's a little different than what we've historically reported is rent as a rate of sales because the large majority of the Harris Teeter stores are leased, not owned like ours, so that affects that line as well, and we break that line out separately. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. 
Rupesh Parikh: I just wanted to delve a little bit more into the upside in the quarter. So you beat the high end of your guidance, I think, by about a few pennies. Was that all driven by sales upside, or are there other things in play? 
J. Schlotman: The sales piece would be, by far, the biggest driver of the upside. 
Michael Ellis: And just to clarify, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we only give an annual guidance. So the only thing you can compare it to is what the Street expectations were. 
Rupesh Parikh: Okay. And then you also mentioned that you're seeing better signs of a consumer this quarter. What are you seeing in some of your more discretionary areas of the business? 
W. McMullen: Well, we've really seen -- I mean, if you look, it's continuing a good, solid trend. It's always hard to define what's discretionary. But certainly, if you look at what areas people cut back on first, we continue to see strong growth on that across the board. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? 
J. Schlotman: No, that pretty much sums it up. There's been some mix changes in what people are buying, it looks like. But overall, it's been strong all across the board. 
Operator: And our next question is from Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse. 
Lauren Wood: This is actually Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just a quick question. Can you remind us what percent of your stores have a heavier mix of natural and organic selection and where that number could potentially go to? And then also if you see a comp lift when you add -- when you sort of bulk up that offering in your store? 
W. McMullen: Well, I don't know if there's any particular area that has a higher mix of natural foods. We tend to -- it's a strategy for the company to improve our natural foods offering across the country, so any of our new stores or remodels, we try to be aggressive on natural foods positioning and the amount of products we carry. So it's pretty much throughout the country, and it's definitely a strategy of ours, and it's really connecting well with customers right now. 
Michael Ellis: And it's not always -- pretty much every store has some offering of natural and organic products. What we're finding is it's as much a lifestyle decision as it is a demographic-driven topic. And people of all demographics are choosing a healthier lifestyle, so we actually have the product. And really, I can't think of stores I go into that don't have some. Now the size of the store can dictate how much you have, but it's a broad-appeal product. 
Lauren Wood: Okay. And then just a quick one. Can you update us on your total MEPP liability? 
Michael Ellis: I don't remember what it is off the top of my head. It was in our 10-K and the MD&A. I don't want to guess the number because I'll be guessing wrong. You can follow up with Cindy and I after the call, but it was in the MD&A and our 10-K. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: I had a housekeeping item first before I got to my bigger question. The ROIC calculation you guys ran in the report, it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but basically, Harris Teeter's reflected in the denominator, but the numerator is not pro forma, or is it? 
J. Schlotman: Okay. So you are correct, Scott. And you also noticed that we went to 1 decimal place instead of 2 decimal places. So the way that works, it's rolling 4 quarters calculations, so your denominator becomes the average assets at the beginning and the end of the year. So you effectively have half of Harris Teeter's assets in there because of that averaging but only 1 quarter of their EBITDA. We'll get more and more of their assets and more and more of their EBITDA as we go throughout the year. So we did it a couple ways. If you look at it just the way this calculation is, it was about 2 basis points down. If you pro forma Harris Teeter in there for the whole time frame, it was about 2 basis points up. So we just decided that rather than try to confuse it, we're going to call it the 13.5% until the end of the year, and then we'll go back to 2 decimal places, I would think. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay, perfect. So then the second question is actually more of a strategy question. I mean, you look at the broader food landscape here, and I think you guys just out-comped Whole Foods, if I'm not wrong about that. But on the other side of the equation, you're clearly out-comping Walmart. You have a format now and probably the best high/low operator out there. You got big data. When do we -- and you just bought Harris Teeter, so -- but when do you put this more aggressively on the road? I think you're in 34 states now. When does Kroger really start to drive even more growth? I mean, clearly, you're taking enormous market share where you are, either through more M&A or more aggressively venturing into places you're not. 
W. McMullen: Scott, as you know, if you look at our fill-in markets, that is the first part of that, and it's really -- if we look at the returns from that, the higher our market share, the higher our ROIC. So that's really the first phase of that is we're increasingly getting aggressive on fill-in markets. And that's -- we're very pleased with the early result. In terms of new markets, by merging with Harris Teeter, we really view that is going into several new markets. And as I've mentioned in the call, one of the things that we're really excited about is the market share opportunity, growth opportunity that Harris Teeter has, and we will aggressively partner and support growing in several of those markets as well. So from our perspective, that is going on the road with it in the context of where we think we see the highest return with the capital that we've allocated. 
Scott Mushkin: Any chance we get a bump in the growth rate that you have out there? 8% to 11%, I think you've been exceeding now for a while. 
W. McMullen: We're not even 2 years in the 8% to 11%, Scott. Let us get comfortable and used to this one for a little bit. But as you know, the key to our growth rate is being sales-led in growing our business and then continuing to executing against our model. So I agree with Mike. Give us a little time, but that's really how we're trying to drive to grow our business. 
Michael Ellis: It's one thing to announce investments in October of '12. It's another thing to begin making those, and then it's another thing again for them to come out of the ground and start generating sales and EBITDA. So there's a lag from when you make the announcement until you get there. Keep in mind, our share buyback in the first quarter is very strong. That was contemplated in our guidance. And we told everybody in October '12 for the first couple, 3 years, 1/3 or half of our growth was going to come from share buyback until our investments started to mature. So we'll have to wait until that tipping point happens, Scott, and see where we are at that point in time. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: Just on the comps, looking at the numbers that Harris Teeter reported last year, it looks like I mean they actually had some pretty decent comps throughout last year, right up until their third quarter. So I'm kind of wondering if you could give some color on what the impact for Harris Teeter was on your comps. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we won't give specifics, and obviously, when we talked in the fourth quarter, we said we would -- we gave guidance with Harris Teeter in it. We were pleased with where Harris Teeter's numbers was. It was consistent with the budget, and that's true for EBITDA as well. But I won't give specifics in terms of how effective the overall total Kroger number other than it wasn't much. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then I know you obviously gave color on your inflation in the current quarter. What are your expectations on inflation for the whole year or full year? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we're kind of expecting in the range where we saw in the first quarter to hold true for the year. I figured inflation was going to come back up again, so I actually flipped to a page in our – you've see me carrying the bluebook around the conferences, Karen. If you look at some interesting things, and without fuel and pharmacy, last year's inflation cadence was 1.7%, 1.6%, 1.5% and 0.8%. And everybody's concerned about inflation right now. In our first quarter, that same metric was 1.8%. Grocery inflation in this year's first quarter was actually lower than grocery inflation in last year's first quarter, and pharmacy and meat and produce are basically in the same range. So this isn't a world we've lived in, and it's not a huge shift, really, from where we were about the same time last year. We're comfortable managing the business in an inflationary environment like we have today and think we're going to see this continue. There's some grain prices out there that are favorable. Milk looks like it's peaked, and it's going to start to come down a little bit, which will help the grocery inflation index because that's where we classify milk when we talk about inflation. So we think it's going to be pretty comparable to where it is today. 
Karen Short: The bluebook came in handy. And then just the last question. It looks -- obviously, you gave your dollar amount for the buyback, but it looks like you're done, pretty much done with your authorization. So any comments on that? 
J. Schlotman: We did have -- our expectation in our guidance for the year, contemplated a front-end buyback program. It is somewhat unusual for us to go without any kind of an authorization. What I would say is unless there's -- I wouldn't expect significant incremental buyback activity for the rest of the year. 
W. McMullen: And it's really left up to our board on the approval. 
J. Schlotman: Right. 
Operator: And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I'm going to probably talk about something a little bit bigger picture. I was very intrigued by the commentary about pension and specifically that you had some employees, a small number, but some employees shift to a 401(k) plan with matching and also that you moved a much larger group of employees to a different plan. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of what the discussions were, why would somebody move away from a defined benefit plan, and what do you think the prospects are for other people recognizing the value of a 401(k)? 
W. McMullen: Yes, there were clearly a couple different moves here, Meredith, both of which came together in the same quarter. The folks in the Pacific Northwest, there were actually 2 separate moves with those folks. They're continuing -- their accrued liability moved into the consolidated UFCW plan that we established a couple years ago. So we took their historical liability that they've already earned into that company-managed UFCW plan. Their future benefits are being accrued in the sound plan, and it's not a sound plan from a financial standpoint, although it's very well-funded. It's called a sound fund in the Pacific Northwest. So that was a group of retail associates. The second move was a group of King Soopers pharmacists who happen to be unionized. Same thing, we moved their obligation, and it was actually through the negotiating process with them where they had the desire to go into our 401(k) plan and be able to manage their investments themselves and accrue those dollars and move them around as they see fit, and that one was really associate-driven at the negotiating table. I will tell you we have some high-level talent dedicated to this effort. In fact, if you remember, a year or so ago, we moved Scott Henderson, who was our Treasurer, and he spent a good chunk of his time, one, he manages our entire pension investment program, both of the -- all 3 of the K plan, the company plan and the UFCW plan, as well as spends a lot of time with our labor negotiators trying to do this. Our view is we're trying to be proactive on this front, not reactive. And we think by being proactive, it's the best thing for our associates, not only for the pension they've already earned but for the pension that they would expect to earn going forward. 
J. Schlotman: And Scott and Mike working with our labor negotiators and the union, they understand the opportunity and need for this, and this really does improve the quality of the benefits our associates have and secures -- and improves the security of their ultimate benefit. So it's one of the things where the union is also working with us on these, but it's a lot of work and a lot of effort. 
W. McMullen: It happens slowly. 300 contracts out there. 
Meredith Adler: I guess it's fair to say that repeating what you did with the pharmacists may be unusual because they are a unique group of employees. 
W. McMullen: Perhaps. You never know what's going to happen in the negotiation. All I know is the unions and Kroger both have a desire to continue conversations to try to come up with creative solutions to secure -- to help secure the benefits they've already earned and give them a decent benefit accrual going forward as well. 
Meredith Adler: That's great. And then I'm going to just switch gears talking about fuel. You had what looks like a pretty attractive margin on fuel this quarter. And I assume that's because prices were coming flat or coming down. Is that fair to say? And kind of what's your outlook, if you can have an outlook, about fuel prices for the rest of the year? And also, did it contribute to earnings per share in any kind of a meaningful way? 
J. Schlotman: What we always say about fuel is one thing we'll guarantee, and that is it will be volatile. It was volatile inside the quarter. There were days and weeks where we were not as thrilled with our fuel results, and then there were days and weeks where we're very thrilled with our fuel results. Relative to the retail price per fuel, in quarter 1, on a total company basis, fuel supermarkets and convenience stores combined, the average retail price per gallon last year was $3.524, and this year, it was $3.456, so it was actually a little bit lower on a combined basis between the 2 years. And the cost was actually about the same amount, maybe just a touch amount lower as well. So it's -- and we had very, very strong gallon growth, almost 6% gallon growth. 
W. McMullen: It helped the quarter, but it wasn't the driver for the quarter by no means. And as you know, we always budget fuel margins kind of the same this year as the prior year. And over time, that always seems to come out pretty close to right. Along the way, there's, as Mike mentioned, quite a bit of volatility. 
Meredith Adler: Right, and I'm just going to throw in one more quick question. I think I just didn't hear what was said about pharmacy and what pharmacy did maybe to comps and anything else about pharmacy profitability. I don't know if you made a comment. Some stuff broke up when I was listening to it. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I made a comment when I spoke about ID sales for the quarter, that they continued their strong performance both from a script count and the sales count -- sales basis. So good ID sales growth in dollars and scripts. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Wanted to ask one follow-up on the inflation questions that you've been getting. With meat rising really quite rapidly the last couple months and the quarter coming out okay in gross margin and you guys saying your survey works, looks like your customers are loosening up their pocketbooks. Are you seeing a lot less change in behavior in terms of trading down in proteins and into lower-quality meats and stuff like that? Well, that's really the question. So it's kind of a pass-through, and are you able to pass it through in a sort of more reasonable way than you would 1 or 2 years earlier, when that type of thing happened? And how's the consumer reacting to that? 
Michael Ellis: If you look at meat, specifically, you can clearly see behavior changes as prices increase. So people buying more cube steaks or buying more hamburger, those kind of things, you can clearly see. The comment on the customer overall is very broadly in terms of if you look at what they're doing in total. We feel very good about and we like what we're seeing in terms of customer in total being willing to spend a little bit more. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And I wanted to ask just a follow-up on Harris Teeter. I know you guys do a lot of survey work with customers, and Harris Teeter has a pretty rich loyalty card as well. Have you been able to do any survey work with their customers? And could you reveal what it is you might have heard from them in terms of -- maybe in terms of the 4 keys that you guys go to the market with or that kind of thing? I know at a conference, recently, you said perishable pricing was a focus, for example. 
Michael Ellis: If you look at, obviously, Harris Teeter has done customer research for years. And before, in a couple of markets, we would have our customer research on Harris Teeter just because they were somebody else in the market. Harris Teeter scores incredibly strong on people and products and freshness of products. So when you look at produce, meat, deli department, they score very well. And their associates are very friendly, and that's really their strong suit. And we would expect, when we start doing the combined research that, that's consistent with the research Harris Teeter had done before. We would expect to see the same. 
Andrew Wolf: And where they score well, let's say, in some of that merchandising and maybe customer interaction as well, is that something where that can be integrated into all or parts of Kroger? Or is it just too much of a task given the size differential between the 2 companies? 
W. McMullen: Mike Ellis, on his prepared comments, talked about it a little bit. I can tell you that Mike Ellis and the operators are spending quite a bit of time trying to understand exactly how Harris Teeter does that. Mike, you're in the middle of all of that. 
Michael Ellis: Well, it's really been fun to have someone who was a competitor that you admire, and now you can actually see what they do, how they do it. But as Rodney mentioned, they've been really strong on some of the matrix, better than us in several markets. So to learn how they do what they do has been actually, really, a lot of fun, and we're integrating some of that into some of our operations today throughout Kroger. 
Operator: And our next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: I guess turning back to the guidance, given the big buyback upfront, it looks like the year assumes a bit of a change in the margin on a stand-alone basis when factoring in the high LIFO charge. I know you don't like to get into this that much, but can you talk qualitatively about your underlying gross margin, even OG&A assumptions in the back half and any unusual shifts we should be expecting? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't -- I won't get that granular. The closest I'll come is we did make comments about operating profit, and as we get a full year of Harris Teeter into the numbers, we would expect our operating profit margin to not be the 12 basis point rolling 4 quarters increase we had in the first quarter. But as we get a full year of them in, we would expect it to come closer to the slight increase that we project overall. 
Stephen Grambling: Okay, that's helpful. And then I think the other thing that, I guess, Kroger's been doing that's a little bit different than other areas in retail is moving towards a few of the larger-format stores, marketplace stores. As you look at general merchandise, which has been shifting online, and you learn from click and collect at Harris Teeter, how are you thinking about the opportunity to offer general merchandise at a broader group of stores with the web? And what are the implications for sales per square foot? 
W. McMullen: Well, all of our large stores have some selection of general merchandise, including apparel, in all of our future plans and remodels that we're working on. And we're really pleased with the results, pleased with sales per square foot and pleased with customers' reaction to the product offering. So it is part of our strategy going forward. 
Stephen Grambling: And for the smaller stores, is there an ability right now to actually have click and collect on general merchandise? 
W. McMullen: Not today. We would expect to take the Harris Teeter click and collect, as Mike mentioned, to other -- to do it in another market. We like what we're seeing there. 
Operator: And our next question is from Jason DeRise of UBS. 
Jason DeRise: It's Jason DeRise. Wanted to ask on natural foods, obviously growing double digits. Can you share what it contributed to the 4.6% comp? 
W. McMullen: We really wouldn't get into that level of detail in terms of how much of the 4.6% is driven by that. Mike did mention that all departments were positive identicals. 
J. Schlotman: All departments and all geographies. 
W. McMullen: Yes. So it's broad-based, so that isn't the thing that's driving it, but obviously a nice growth. 
Jason DeRise: And when you look at your customer data, do you think that this is a customer who's just entering the category in a more meaningful way now that you're offering it? Or do you think that, perhaps, this is sales that previously were outside of Kroger, at maybe a specialty store, and now that shopper is deciding to do that trip back at Kroger solely? 
W. McMullen: I think it's all of the above. There's been lower prices in a lot of areas in natural foods, so it's bringing new customers to the category. But certainly, people are more health-conscious for their family and the things that they consume. So a lot of our customer insights are driving a lot of the decisions on what we carry and what we put into our stores. And they are – customer is shouting that this is something they're really interested in, so it's a big focus for us. 
Jason DeRise: I think it was maybe a year or 2 ago, there was a lot of talk about how Kroger only has half of their customers' grocery spend. How has that trended since the efforts in natural foods and other categories to try to win more of that share? 
W. McMullen: Jason, it's a great question, and it's one that if you were in the room, you'd see us smiling at each other because it's pretty similar to what it was because the fortunate part, we keep adding new customers. So if you look at the loyal shoppers that have been loyal for a while, we continue -- that 50% would probably be more like 70% to 75%. Fortunately, we keep growing our customers, so you have new loyal customers coming in. So when you look at the blend of existing loyals and new loyals, it's still around the 50%. 
Michael Ellis: Yes, and if you look at ID loyal customers, it would be much higher than 50%. But the good news is, is we keep adding people that become loyal below the 50%, so it dilutes the total back down. 
W. McMullen: Obviously, natural foods helps on that, but it's really across the whole store that we're picking up that customer, including the fresh departments, produce, meat, deli, bakery, seafood. 
Jason DeRise: Okay, great. And I guess I just wanted to see if I can put this in there on Harris Teeter. Would you quantify just the EPS accretion for the quarter just so that we can sanity-check the original guidance on that? 
W. McMullen: You should assume that our original guidance, our updated guidance would have the same base assumptions for the Harris Teeter contributions to the year. I did mention that Harris Teeter is performing consistent -- a little bit better but not a lot in terms of the analysis that we used when we were working on the merger. So we're pleased with where they're tracking, and it would be consistent with what we shared before. 
Michael Ellis: Right on track with what our expectations were. 
Jason DeRise: I mean, there's been, in the press, I guess, part of it's your press, but that the Harris Teeter started dropping prices, similar type of press releases that you had seen coming out of other Kroger banners on this. And so that's -- I guess is there anything you could share about how that's gone. Is that what's driven maybe a bit more of the upside response to that, or is that not where the incremental upside has been? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's really very, very early in that process. And what we're doing is the synergies, as we accomplish them, Harris Teeter is taking that money and giving it back to the customers. So it's really giving the customers something back from the merger and some of the savings, and Mike mentioned insurance, for example. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Looking again at the pension benefit announcement you made the other day, Mike, I'd like to get a better idea on how the cash flows are going to look on this. You're obviously not going to pay $56 million immediately. But at the same time, how might that be broken up over the next 5 years or so as it moves into the funds, and is there a corresponding offset in your hourly contribution to these plans? 
J. Schlotman: A couple questions there. So the $56 million is the after-tax cash we'll have to put in. And as we said, we have up to 5 years to do that. We really haven't decided exactly how we're going to do it. The Kings Sooper pharmacists is a smaller part of that total contribution, and we actually have longer than 5 years to do theirs. But you should expect some plan over the 5 years to do it. What this really does is, technically, what happened is assets and liabilities came attached to their already earned and accrued benefits, and that's what we're shoring up in these plans. Going forward, they will continue to earn benefits. In the pharmacists' case, they'll get a K plan matched. In the Pacific Northwest contract, they'll continue to earn a benefit going forward, and there will be cents per hour accrual for those benefits going forward. So it won't reduce that. 
Charles Cerankosky: So the $56 million is to shore up the plans, and whatever's negotiated going forward is an additional pennies per hour kind of deal? 
J. Schlotman: Right. Now, what we don't have to negotiate and worry about funding going forward is any cents per hour to make up the $56 million because we'll do that separately. So going forward, any portion of an hourly contribution that was there to make up an underfunding in the plan, obviously, we've already negotiated that and walled it off.  So all we have to worry about funding is future benefit accruals, not vested benefit accruals. It'll be separate. 
Charles Cerankosky: And announcements of this sort are likely to recur, but it's very difficult to forecast when and how frequent. Is that a fair statement? 
J. Schlotman: Can't predict when and how, and it's one of the reasons we had a disclosure of this kind of activity in our outlook section in the 10-K because -- that's why we dedicated some very talented resources to this because we would love to continue to pick off opportunities like this to secure -- to help secure the pension benefits of our associates going forward in some of these underfunded plans, get that out of that fund. If that fund runs into trouble, we know our associates are taken care of because we have them in a fund that we're helping manage. And we do view that what we have is an obligation to do that for them. 
Operator: And the next question is from Philippe Guzens [ph] of Mitsubishi. 
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] has recently indicated that they had seen a pickup in competitive activity, not only, obviously, in their home market with the expansion of Albert Heijn [ph] stores, but also in some U.S. markets. Should we read into that that you, perhaps, have sharpened a little bit your pricing already with Harris Teeter, given that they do compete with the Food Lion stores in a number of markets? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned before, that's a good assumption, but it's just early in that process. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, if I may. I may have missed this, but following the announcement yesterday, have you indicated by how much your multiemployer liability will shrink on the balance sheet? 
J. Schlotman: Well, that amount we put in the MD&A is not entirely on our balance sheet. And theoretically, it will be reduced by the $56 million once we fund it. That $56 million will actually now sit as a liability in our balance sheet until we do fund it. 
Operator: And next, we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. 
Kelly Bania: Just on your comp guidance, you clearly raised it. First quarter was strong, sounds like second quarter's running strong as well. And you talked about a little bit of a less cautious consumer behavior, which I don't think I've heard you guys say for a while, and upticking inflation. So just curious if there's any conservatism in that 3% to 4% kind of outlook for the rest of the year or any other thing that we should be thinking about getting back to a 3% to 4% range. 
W. McMullen: The one thing that -- if you look at last year by quarter, the fourth quarter actually was a little better than the trend had been. It wasn't driven by weather, but it was helped by weather. And as we start cycling some of those things, until you actually cycle them, obviously, you don't know where you are. Now we'll always hope that we're a little conservative, but until you get there, it is our best estimate at this point it time. I don't know, Mike or Mike, you want to... 
Michael Ellis: I agree completely. 
J. Schlotman: I would agree completely also. 
Kelly Bania: Great. And if I can just add another question on natural foods, clearly up strong again. Just curious, if you look at your competition, whether it's discount channel or supermarkets or elsewhere, do you see them investing as much as you are in natural product categories? I mean, I realize Walmart's announced a Wild Oats line. We haven't really seen that show up in stores yet, but do you think some others could start to invest more in natural foods as well? Or what are you seeing versus your competition? 
W. McMullen: Well, there is investment. We're seeing competitive investment in natural foods. For us, we've positioned natural foods in different parts of the store now. You'll find soy milks, almond milks in the regular dairy case and things like that. So we're just trying to answer what the customer wants and have products available at a price they're willing to pay and in a location that they're happy to find them. So but competitively, yes, we've seen a little bit of move but not much. 
Operator: And that question will come from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities. 
Kate Wendt: So I just actually had a bigger picture question. As you look at your overall store base, whether you think you'll see a net increase in competitive openings against you this year or if it's consistent, you think, with last year or maybe offset by closures at weaker chains? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be affecting your comps this quarter, but just curious how you see that playing out this year. 
Michael Ellis: Yes, it's a good question. And you continue to see a lot of people talk about adding square footage in the space. Some of that square footage is dedicated to what we sell inside of a different format, be it inside of a Dollar General store or a drugstore or something like that. Walmart's obviously building some smaller neighborhood and kind of markets, so that's there. What kind of gets lost is competitors who are closing stores that I would call -- versus a small offering inside of another format, what I would call a destination store. So when you have a destination store close and it's 50,000 or 60,000 square feet and somebody else has added 1,200 square feet, that's really a convenience shop. It's a different kind of competitor. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of square footage open up that sells food. I think overall, the destination kind of square footage is probably flat to slightly down. 
Kate Wendt: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one other quick one. I saw that you recently introduced a premium pet food assortment, which sounds like it could be a nice incremental comp driver for you guys. I was wondering how many stores that's in today and maybe how many you're planning by year end. And then it also sounds like maybe along with that, there's been a change in the receptivity of premium pet food brands distributing to the supermarket channel. 
W. McMullen: Yes, we just recently introduced, I'm glad you caught that, a new line of premium pet foods. And it should be in every store in Kroger, I would hope. That is the plan. And sales have started out strong, we're pleased with it. Glad you caught that.
 Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Earlier this month, we introduced the Taste of Mexico event in all our stores. We hope our associates are enjoying this fun celebration of Mexican food with our customers, including in-store sampling, creative displays and special activities. I know I've enjoyed visiting our stores across the country and seeing the creativity, passion and enthusiasm from our associates for the Taste of Mexico. This special event is the first of a series of celebrations of foods of the world in our stores and runs through June 24. 
 Our associates' passion for doing good is evident in the way we serve our customers and neighbors in the communities where we live and work every day. This month, we honor our associates' efforts in serving our communities and those in need. We are pleased to recognize in our 2013 annual report 28 associates across the company for their outstanding volunteer service as recipients of The Kroger's 2013 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent on our veterans, feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and bringing music to mentally challenged, among many other causes. We are grateful for their commitment. A big heartfelt thank you to all our associates who volunteer. Mike and I are proud of the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others and the communities we call home. Thank you.
 That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us. 
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2014 Q4  (2014-03-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2013 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Holmes. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Our associates continue to execute our accelerated growth plan, resulting in a great quarter and a full year we are proud of. Kroger is delivering on the key performance targets we committed to when we outlined our long-term growth strategy at our October 2012 investor meeting. Mike Schlotman will give more details about each of the 4 metrics, but I'd like to share the highlights. 
 We achieved our 41st consecutive quarter of identical supermarket sales growth. We expanded our rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin excluding fuel. We improved our return on invested capital even as we increased capital investments, and we increased our market share in 2013.
 For the full year, we continue to perform for shareholders by delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We achieved our ninth consecutive year of reducing operating expense as a rate of sales, and we returned 600 -- or $928 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. That we accomplished all of this while also successfully completing our merger with Harris Teeter is a great testament to our associates' determined focus on serving our customers. We are confident that 2014 will be a great year and that we will continue to deliver growth that investors can count on.
 Consistent with what we've been saying for the last several years, we expect the economic recovery in 2014 to remain fragile and uneven. Things will continue to get better for some customers, while others remain under economic stress, and we are doing all we can to help. For customers focused on their budget, we continue to offer low entry price points on key items, especially in our corporate brands portfolio.
 If you look at our SNAP households during the fourth quarter, they increased their total monthly spending in our stores for each of the 3 months since the benefit reductions took effect compared to the prior year. What we saw play out in the fourth quarter was what we anticipated, that SNAP customers spent more of their own cash on food.
 All of our customers are benefiting from our relentless focus on friendly service and fresh products, including our organic and natural foods and our own unique brands like Simple Truth. We have a lot of room to grow because the overall industry in which we operate in is expanding. We continue to improve our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether value, mainstream or upscale customers, we are competitively positioned to deliver the right value proposition, and our customer insights help us to focus on the right opportunities for growth in each segment, so that we will capture more of the share of the massive food market.
 Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? 
Michael Ellis: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. We continue to have opportunity with our low customers because on average, we capture $0.50 of every $1 they spend on the products that we sell. This figure has remained steady due to the effect that new households have on this calculation. As we told you in December, our loyal household count has increased by an outstanding 83% over the past decade. We do, however, see incrementally more spending from our mature loyal households.
 During the fourth quarter, we continue to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We continue to improve our friendliness, product freshness, shopping experience and price perception in our customers' eyes. As you know, we closely tracked these 4 keys against our competitors. What we have been tracking internally is consistent with the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index released last month, which reported steady improvement in Kroger customer satisfaction.
 Inflation was low in the fourth quarter. We expect inflation to be low in 2014 as well, which is reflected in our identical store sales guidance for the year, which Mike Schlotman will talk about shortly. A key driver of growth is our commitment to Customer 1st innovation. As you know, we have done a lot of innovative things over the past couple of years to create unique competitive advantages for Kroger, like our faster checkout initiative. Each quarter, we will highlight one or more innovations that improve our connection with customers and improve our market share. This quarter, I will highlight corporate brands and digital.
 Corporate brands continue to be leading differentiator for Kroger. We introduced 937 new products in fiscal 2013, including 100 new Simple Truth items. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing pace, and we now expect it to reach $1 billion brand status by the end of fiscal 2014.
 Corporate brands continue to gain market share during the fourth quarter, with corporate brands representing approximately 27.2% of total units sold and 24.4% of our sales dollars, including pharmacy and fuel.
 We recently announced the exciting new acquisition of our digital coupon marketing provider, YOU Technology. We believe that YOU Tech has strong growth potential and will, over time, become the leading digital coupon provider for U.S. retailers, not just Kroger. YOU Tech has helped us reach another digital milestone recently. We began offering digital coupons in early 2010 and within 3 years, our customers had downloaded 500 million digital coupons. Customers download the next 500 million in only 14 months. In fact, at approximately 5:57 p.m. Eastern Time on February 6, a customer downloaded Kroger's 1 billionth digital coupon. It was an exciting moment for us and one that demonstrates the growth and customer acceptance of our digital efforts.
 Now I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We're currently negotiating contracts in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, we added more than 7,000 jobs last year and more than 40,000 jobs over the last 6 years. Those numbers are even larger when you include Harris Teeter's more than 25,000 associates.
 Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results, as well as our guidance for 2014. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. As Rodney mentioned earlier, when we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.
 Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter ID sales growth of 4.3%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and deli bakery departments also posted strong ID sales growth, highlighting our customers' continued demand for fresh products. Kroger's pharmacy department continues to outperform as well. Our ID sales results, in light of the slow economic recovery and low inflation throughout the year, are quite remarkable. Weather conditions across much of the country were a net positive as well. Our team's Customer 1st response to weather events kept our stores open and shelf stock, which coupled with our convenient locations, made Kroger more accessible for customers who flock to stores to stock up before winter storms.
 For only 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 11 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2012 result. This is a result above our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters' basis.
 The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital, excluding Harris Teeter, on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters' basis of 13.43% compared to 13.42% during the same period last year. As we told you, as we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.
 Our fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money. In the past, we use Nielsen Homescan data as our source for market share. We're now using a different Nielsen product, Nielsen POS plus, which includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy. We believe Nielsen POS plus is a good data -- is a good and consistent source. While POS plus does not include all of our competitors today, it covers -- captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including most perishable items, which Nielsen Homescan did not include. 
 According to Nielsen POS data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during 2013. This data also indicates that our share increased in 16 of the 18 markets outlined by the Nielsen Report and was down slightly in 2 markets. 
 Walmart supercenters are 1 of our top 2 competitors in 13 of the 18 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger increased share in 12 of those markets and declined slightly in 1. The Nielsen POS data is generated by real retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes food, drug, mass and dollar channels. This does not include C-store and club.
 Now I'll share our fourth quarter results and fiscal 2013 results. Please note that Harris Teeter is included in the company's ending balance sheet, but because of the timing late in the year, it had no effect on our adjusted fourth quarter or fiscal 2013 earnings. If you remember last year, we gave you details to better understand how our core business performed. This year, we have similarly outlined our adjustments for fiscal 2013 and 2012 in Table 6 of our earnings release. The following results are all adjusted as outlined in Table 6 and exclude the effect of the 53rd week last year.
 In the fourth quarter, our net earnings totaled $421.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding the items outlined in Table 6, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share grew 10% to $0.78 in the fourth quarter. We recorded a $9.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $41.2 million credit in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin increased 11 basis points from the same period last year excluding retail fuel operations.
 Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 16 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.
 Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2013 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.113 compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year, after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.141 compared with $0.14 last year, again, after adjusting for the additional week.
 Turning now to full year 2013 results, Kroger reported total sales of $98.4 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.9% after adjusting for the extra week last year. On this basis, and excluding fuel, total sales increased 4.2% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.6% in fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 totaled $1.52 billion or $2.90 per diluted share, adjusted net earnings of $1.5 billion or $2.85 per share, a growth of 13%.
 Kroger's LIFO charge for fiscal 2013 was comparable to fiscal 2012. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales for the ninth consecutive year. In fiscal 2013, OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 24 basis points.
 For 2014, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $10.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from a year ago as a result of the Harris Teeter transaction and due to the timing late in our fiscal year, we realized no incremental EBITDA in 2013 from this transaction. Therefore, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.43 compared to 2.04 during the same period last year.
 Kroger remains committed to managing its free cash flow to achieve a 2 to 2.2x net total debt to EBITDA ratio over the next 18 to 24 months. 
 Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2.3 billion for the year compared to $2 billion for 2012. For 2014, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter. As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and return on invested capital. We continue to make good progress adding square footage in our fill-in markets, and we have identified others based on various metrics. Additionally, we continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically. In 2013, we opened the first stores under our new capital allocation strategy. It is still early, but we are pleased with their performance to budget and expect these and future stores will greatly support our growth plan.
 During 2013, Kroger purchased 16.1 million common shares for a total investment of $609 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has approximately $18.7 remaining -- $18.7 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012.
 Now I'd like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2014. This range takes into account the expectation of low inflation during the year and includes Harris Teeter.
 Full year net earnings for fiscal 2014 are expected to range from $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. This guidance includes Harris Teeter. Growing fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.85 by our long-term growth rate of $0.08 to $0.11 equates to a range of $3.08 to $3.16 per diluted share. We then added the net accretion to earnings from the Harris Teeter merger of $0.06 to $0.09 per diluted share, excluding transition in -- transaction costs, resulting in the 10% to 14% growth rate for fiscal 2014. As you think about early estimates for 2015, we would expect to return to our 8% to 11% long-term growth rate.
 As we report earnings during 2014, we will not break out Harris Teeter results separately, which is consistent with our treatment of all supermarket divisions today. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a growing dividend, and we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2014, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to adjusted fiscal 2013 results.
 When looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the first, second and fourth quarters to be within the 10% to 14% range and the third quarter to be above it.
 Now I will turn it back to Rodney. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Being part of a growing retailer is exciting for our associates. 7,000 new jobs last year means not just new team members, but opportunities for our current associates to grow and advance as well. 
 Our business is strong. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going well, and our associates continue to execute our growth strategy. The remarkable consistency of Kroger's performance has shown time and again that serving our customers is serving our shareholders. I can think of no better example than our associates' dynamic response to the severe weather in many of our markets during the fourth quarter. Often, our logistics and distribution teams sped up deliveries to keep stores stocked several days before major storms. Most of our stores remained open even in the worst of the winter weather. In some cases, our associates even welcome stranded travelers in extreme freezing conditions to spend the night in one of our stores. Our customers trust that our -- their neighborhood Kroger will be open and stocked when it matters most, and we couldn't be more proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion.
 Now we look forward to your questions. Glenn, you can go ahead and get questions started. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: I just wanted to start with a strategic question. You provided the market share performance and how you do against supercenters. I'm curious, how many neighborhood markets are you against today and what has the experience there been? And how do you think about competitively addressing that format, right, which is basically a supermarket format versus a supercenter? 
W. McMullen: In terms of the specific numbers, I wouldn't have those. I don't know, Mike or Mike, if you have the specific numbers? Obviously, we have a lot of respect for everybody that we compete against. We would not look at a neighborhood store much different than a supercenter. And what we're really focused on is, obviously, our customer and serving our customers and making sure that we continue to improve the value, but we really don't see the effect much different. Part of it will depend on how close that neighborhood store is to a Walmart -- prior Walmart store as well, affected as well. And then, Mike, anything you want to add? 
Michael Ellis: Well, we know that there's significant capital being allocated to the neighborhood markets, but as Rodney mentioned, one of our advantages really is our location. We're located within 2 miles of so many of our customers that and convenience and the variety that we offer, we feel comfortable where we're at today. 
John Heinbockel: And we don't know -- I mean, in the markets we -- over last week with supercenter and your gain in share, you don't know where that's coming from. So that could be coming from -- even a lot of that could be coming from fallout among traditional food retailers? 
W. McMullen: That's correct, John. And we -- also, if you look at some of the additions that we're doing with natural foods, organic, things like that, so some of the gain in share would be that as well. So it's not just only other traditional supermarkets. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then, well, lastly, what do you think the impact is, in totality, right, the good and bad impact from ACA this year? 
W. McMullen: I was -- we were looking at each other. When you look at '14, we really don't think at the end of the day it'll have a huge amount of effect in '14. Obviously, over time, it will have an increasing -- increasingly amount of effect. Whether that's a net positive or a negative, I think it's way too early, because obviously, on some pieces of it, it's a positive because it expands people's access to health care, which in our pharmacy business and our health care business is a positive. So I think it's way too early to tell you one thing or the other. We're working really hard to make sure that we try to minimize the effect on our associates as we transition to the new plans. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I actually quickly like to follow up just on what you were talking about now, just to confirm that when you talk about the impact on your associates, it's only the nonunionized associates you're talking about, right? 
W. McMullen: No. I mean, obviously, with the union plans, we will partner with the union and try to make sure that we minimize that effect, but it's much broader than just only our own health care plans. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. And then I just want to switch gears and talk about -- I know that you're investing a fair amount of money in North Texas, and that it does include not just building facility stores, but also lowering prices. And I was just wondering if you could talk more broadly about your strategy. I think this is an indication of the -- things you were talking about more broadly, but I wanted -- I just want to talk about why that market and how it's going and what is the new response to lower prices? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the strategy itself, there would be lots of markets that we would have similar strategies in. It just happens that this one has a little -- it's a little higher profile than some of the others, and why that happens is always hard to say. As you know, overall, we remain committed to slightly improving our operating margins. And as we take costs out of the business, we partner with dunnhumby and figure out a way to give that lower cost back to the customers in ways that matter. And as you know, that's been our strategy for many years, and we continue to do that. And if you look at the things that we're doing in fourth -- that we did in '13, the things we're doing in '14, we're very pleased with the results we're getting, just like we have been for the last several years. I don't know, Mike or Mike, do you want to add anything? 
Michael Ellis: No. 
J. Schlotman: No. 
Meredith Adler: Okay, that actually clarifies things somewhat. And then I'm going to ask a tough question, and I'm not even sure I should ask it. But would you do anything in the world of M&A that would substantially change your balance sheet or the tasks that you have to accomplish in the next couple of years? 
J. Schlotman: It's an interesting way to ask the elephant-in-the-room question, Meredith. 
Meredith Adler: I try to be interesting all the time. 
J. Schlotman: It just doesn't do us any good to comment on potential activity that's out there, so we'll just take the stance of no comment on M&A activity. 
W. McMullen: That's one of the things. Meredith, the only thing I would add is just remember the model that we've outlined in terms of growing our business for our shareholders doesn't require any type of mergers to achieve. And if you think about the merger with Harris Teeter, the benefit that, that brought to our company, we actually increased the growth rate from the first year. In terms of specifics, I'm not going to get into any specifics. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: Meredith, you took my question. So I actually wanted to go to gross margins and a lot of our work is showing you guys priced very aggressively on some of these fast-turning items, probably more aggressively than we've ever seen you. Yet your FIFO gross margins are probably better than we would've expected and continue to push in the right direction. How are you doing this? I mean, one side of it, you're taking huge share, pricing is very aggressive. But on the other side, it seems like you've got some secret sauce here. And I just wanted to have any comments on how you're able to do this. 
J. Schlotman: The fourth quarter was a little different than everybody had seen and has expected from us. Clearly, pharmacy that we talked about in the prepared comments had a very strong year and was a good contributor to gross margin. It had a nice gross margin increase. Our mix in the fourth quarter was very strong. When you look at just gross margin, obviously, a lot of those fresh categories have a little bit higher overall margin than some of the center-of-the-store categories, so that mix can help. And certainly, the snow helped, as we made the comments on people coming in to stock up before weather events. Typically, when people go on a normal shopping trip, they shop off of their lists. When they come in to stock up before an event like that, they come in to stock up before an event like that, and they aren't really beholden to a list at that point in time. So I would say those 3 were the main drivers of what we saw in the fourth quarter, not necessarily something that's going to continue out into the future. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. Then I -- one other question about the guidance. I noticed -- I think you're down pretty low on your repurchase authorization. I think, Mike, you said about $18 million or something or $18 million, $19 million left. How much of the guidance of repurchase activity is contemplated in that guidance? I mean, should we expect a change, I mean, you're -- like you're almost done? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, a couple things on repurchase activity. We've been a regular buyer of our shares since January of 2000. There have been a few times when we've been out in the market, and most notably, around the White House work stoppage and then when we were blacked out as a result of the Harris Teeter negotiations. But other than that, we've generally been in the market almost all of the time and I would expect going into the future, we would continue to be in the market. Obviously, I don't have a lot of money left to do that with and our guidance, as we just talked about back in October of '12, in the early years of that growth model, it is an important contributor to our earnings per share growth, until those stores, as we talked about coming out of the ground beginning in 2013 start to mature, we will rely on some share buyback activity. To get any more specific than that -- I'm not going to go any more specific. 
Scott Mushkin: So there is some of that contemplated in the guidance you put out? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: Great. I have 2 questions, let me try and attack the elephant a bit differently. Can you remind us in general what your requirements are or what attributes you look for when you do M&A? And my impression has been that you're not necessarily interested in what I would call turnaround stories that needs some price investment, but you'd rather buy a ready-to-wear asset like Harris Teeter. Is that a fair judgment still? Would you theoretically look at stores that need a little TLC if the price is attractive enough? Just on a general basis. 
J. Schlotman: Well, even when you look at -- let's just talk about the Harris Teeter transaction. The thing that was attractive about Harris Teeter as a transaction is that it's a well-run company that overall we admired a whole lot. That's not to say -- you only picked off price as an attribute that might need some TLC. What we have not liked over time is poorly run companies, not just one attribute of the company that might have an issue. 
Kenneth Goldman: That's helpful. Can you maybe just add a little color on what poorly run means to you? 
J. Schlotman: We're getting close to just -- to asking the question. Poorly run just -- results aren't strong, cash flow is not strong, pick the attributes. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay, I hear you. And then other question, can you talk a little bit about how happy you are with center store performance in general? And the reason I'm asking is the shelf's stable numbers that we're seeing from the manufacturing side, just very sluggish across the board except natural and organic and yet we're seeing specialty groceries, right, that focus on fresh, prepared, et cetera, do pretty well across the board. I walked down the aisles of Kroger and Safeway and SUPERVALU banners and I see a lot of meaningful space still being given to cereal, soup and categories in decline. I'm just wondering how long can that last, right? What would it take for you to take a more dramatic change to your in-store footprint, right, so you can replace some of that dry grocery shelving with some room for fresh, prepared, et cetera? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the core of our business is still a big part of our business. And when we look at space allocation, especially in some of our new stores, you'll find that we are allocating more and more space to perishable, refrigerated and the categories that the customer really cares about. The customer is telling us that's what they're interested in, but we can't ignore the center store and health and beauty care products and grocery that are still a big, big part of our business. But we constantly look at space allocation and make adjustments based on what the customer is telling us they want. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay, so no plans to sort of accelerate that shift in space? 
J. Schlotman: No, I think we're constantly looking at this, the allocation and making changes. If you get into our new stores, I believe you'll see some changes in mix. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. 
Robert Ohmes: I just had a few quick follow-ups. First, I just want to clarify, and you guys have probably explained it more than once, but so the SNAP reductions are actually supporting market share gains for you? Is that fair to say? 
W. McMullen: Well, I wouldn't say it that way. What we're seeing is our SNAP customers continue to spend more money with us, and what they're doing is substituting SNAP dollars with their own cash or on debit or credit card. We believe -- if you look, overall, fuel prices are down to even, depending on what part of the period you're looking at. So we believe some of that has been funded by our SNAP customers spending less in other places and reallocating dollars. So I wouldn't make the direct connection the way you did. We're really focused on how do we make sure that we're giving the best value we can to that customer, along with all our other customers, and they're rewarding us by spending more money with us. 
Robert Ohmes: Got you. That's great. Second follow-up question, which is the weather and stock-up, any -- did you guys take a guess at quantifying how much that might have helped comps in the fourth quarter in gross margin? 
J. Schlotman: It's really difficult to say. When you look at weeks like that, clearly, it's a net positive when it winds up happening. But you have days that are up double the prior year and then you have a couple days after that, that are down significantly from the prior year. So it gets very, very choppy. Clearly, with the help, and as I said in the prepared comments or I said earlier in the -- to the gross profit question, the mix during those shops helps the gross profit rate because people come in, really, not with the list like they'd normally do, but they come in to have things deep for the next couple of days. 
W. McMullen: Robbie, overall, was -- it was helpful, but we did -- when you look at the 2004 expectations, we grew that off of the actual '13, excluding any unusual items. So we did not adjust out that -- any weather benefit. But overall, we do think it was a net positive. 
Robert Ohmes: Got you. And then last question, I'll let you guys move to the next. Harris Teeter, I'm a personal fan of. I shop there when I'm down south. And is there any other -- you guys have talked about some of the things they do well that you might be able to bring into The Kroger store base. Anything since we last did a conference call that you can update us on? 
J. Schlotman: Robbie, it's -- the merger ultimately closed January 28. So it's only been a handful of weeks since we've actually been able to roll up our sleeves and have the kind of conversations you want to have when you start integrating a company. That said, we've made a lot of progress in those 6 or so weeks since the merger's been closed. Clearly, one of the things we like is that about -- a little over 160 of their stores, they have what -- it's called Express Lane, we call it click and collect. That's something that intrigues us as -- it's an internet but pick-it-up yourself kind of a process at the store that appears to appeal very strongly to their customer. That's something we'll try to learn from. But it's been a very positive and we're very happy with the start we've had to the integration progress with Harris Teeter. And any surprise that we've seen has been a positive, not a negative surprise, which is always nice. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Greg Hessler with Bank of America. 
Gregory Hessler: So my question is with the Harris Teeter acquisition, it kind of brought you back into the M&A market where you've been absent for a number of years. And I know you can't comment on market rumors, but internally, has there been any sort of shift or change in the way that you'd look at M&A opportunities? 
J. Schlotman: No, I'd say it's consistent with how we've always done it. And also, as I said in my prepared comments, our investment-grade rating is important to us and we continue to expect to allocate free cash flow to maintain our rating. 
Gregory Hessler: Okay. And I think with the Harris Teeter acquisition, you sort of temporarily went above that 2 to 2.2x net leverage target. I mean, how much flex do you feel like you have within the investment-grade rating band? And would you be able -- or would you be willing to even go maybe a little bit higher than that for the right strategic opportunity? 
J. Schlotman: Yes -- I'm not going to comment on that. And obviously, the only reason -- the reason we're above the 2.2x on Harris Teeter is the shareholders won't wait a year to get their check for the purchase of their shares. They want that upfront. We don't get a year's worth of EBITDA until the end of the year. So it's really just the fact we have all the debt and none of the EBITDA now, and we feel very good about our ability to get back under 2.2x in the time frame we outlined to the rating agencies. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Karen Short, Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: A couple of questions just on your guidance. What is your -- in guidance, specifically. What is your guidance and planned D&A, as well as interest expense? It seems like -- I mean, we can kind of calculate interest expense or incremental interest expense related to Harris Teeter, but D&A was a little bit of a wildcard. So any color there? 
J. Schlotman: Obviously, from the write-off of the assets for Harris Teeter, the amortization of that will pick up. I don't have that in front of me, and I prefer not to go giving guidance on every line of the income statement. I might as well just hand you my business plan and let the whole world have it, which I think we give as much or more guidance than anyone. So you should be able to back into it just based on the public guidance we've given of what our earnings per share is and the number of lines we've given you. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then looking at your MEPP guidance for 2014, I think it reflects kind of an 11% increase in the expense. Any color on why that increase is so high. That just seems high to me. 
J. Schlotman: The contributions into the plan? 
Karen Short: Yes, the $250 million? 
J. Schlotman: It's just our expectation. There are some funds in rehab status that -- one of the ways you get out of rehab status is you put a little bit more money in, benefits come down a little bit and over time, it's an attempt to try to get them in a better funded position. It's -- while the percentage is fairly strong, it's not that much incremental cash that we're expecting next year. 
W. McMullen: And it would be something that we'll work with the unions on to make sure that we try to get those funds in a status that's sustainable over time. And it would be an ongoing negotiation and relationship in terms of the balance between what money we spend on pension, what money we spend on health care and what we're able to do on wages. So it's really all together. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And just on your investment-grade ratings, getting back to that 2x to 2.2x, I guess what I'm confused about is why wouldn't they be looking at the pro forma number regardless in terms of your investment-grade rating [indiscernible] they are? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I believe the rating agencies do that, which is why they did not downgrade us when we announced the merger. Obviously, the conversations were -- with them were our commitment to get it back down there based on a pro forma calculation you do for them, and that's what they got comfortable with. So from the rating agency standpoint, they would look at it that way. But from the number I have to report, my number is my number. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Could you touch on a couple of categories in particular about how they did during the quarter, one would be general merchandise, especially at Fred Meyer and then prepared foods, please? 
Michael Ellis: Yes, general merchandise, it was such an interesting holiday season with 6 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And predicting our business and building our business plan around that was certainly -- it doesn't happen very often. But overall, the season came out pretty decent. It wasn't as different as we would've thought it would've been. I think we actually came out okay when you figure the changes in by Friday, the differences in the calendar and everything else that occurred. And so in general, I would say it came out okay. Jewelry, for example, for us, had a really stellar quarter, and general merchandise was fairly decent. I mean, I would say it came out okay. But in terms of -- what was the other question, prepared food? 
W. McMullen: Yes -- and overall, it turned out better than we were expecting when you think about 6 less days and the economy and especially some of the weather in parts of the countries. But overall, we felt pretty good about it, prepared goods. Go ahead, Mike. 
J. Schlotman: Prepared foods continue to be a growing section of our business for us, so we're committing more and more space and better products all the time to those types of departments and items. So I wouldn't say there's anything really unusual when it comes to prepared food. 
Charles Cerankosky: All right. And finally, can you give us an update on sales trends, thus far, into the first quarter? 
Michael Ellis: Obviously, it's very early in the quarter. Right now, we would be a little bit better than the high side of the range, but it's still very early, and we believe the weather has been a positive so far. As we've mentioned, as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, when you look at the year as a whole, we expect inflation to be reasonably modest throughout the whole year. But so far, so good. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: You did mention the innovation in digital on the YOU Tech acquisition. So can you actually maybe describe some of the synergies that come from that acquisition, what they are maybe bringing to the table that you didn't have already and just the contribution you're expecting there over the next, call it, 5 years? 
Michael Ellis: Well, I'm not really so sure I can comment on synergies, but we do like what YOU Tech brings to us in terms of the technology and our ability to serve up coupons for our customers in a really meaningful way. And you couple that with dunnhumby, and we think that this really gives us a great platform to communicate better with our customer and provide them both technology and the coupons that they're looking for today. Because a customer can redeem coupons simply by taking their loyalty card into the store and scanning it, and they're receiving the things they want most and getting discounts on those items. 
Stephen Grambling: When I said synergies, I guess, I meant qualitatively. And I guess, the follow-up would be, as you look at developing this yourself versus making this acquisition, is this just the way to jumpstart moving to maybe even integrating some of the customized coupons to the customer? 
Michael Ellis: Yes, well, it certainly helped us move faster. And the relationship with YOU Technology has moved us along a lot quicker than we probably would've done on our own. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, there's multiple levels to it, Stephen. When you talk about customized coupons, today, all of the digital coupons that are out there, there's a sort feature on The Kroger app that allows you to sort those coupons based on the relevance to you of how you shop and what you buy. So rather than having to search through all the coupons that might be attractive, the app basically does that for you based on how you actually buy product. 
Stephen Grambling: Great. And then I have a quick follow-up to I think it was Ken's question. And you had mentioned last quarter that you would expect the margin on natural organic items to converge over time with conventional. And as I think initially, it may have been viewed as maybe reduction in margin on those items, but given the consolidation in the space and your reallocation of the natural organic to be a little bit greater versus the center store, is there any reason to see the margin maybe even go up on the conventional items over time? 
W. McMullen: It's a good question. I think it's pretty hard to say. We would not expect that as a general rule and we're really focused on figuring out ways to give the customer better and better deal. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: So Cerberus is one of the parties reportedly looking at Safeway. If you look at their behavior after their acquisition of the Supervalu banners, would you say they were more or less disciplined on price? And how is their behavior in the marketplace as a competitor after the move there? 
W. McMullen: Obviously, in terms of a lot of specifics, we won't be able to give you that. But we look at Cerberus and Albertsons as a very good competitor, and we're really focused on what does our customer want and then how do we get better about delivering against that. They're a good competitor, but there's a lot of good competitors out there. So probably a little more focused on the basics every day, but I wouldn't say it's appreciable different. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay, so you didn't see any C-change in pricing strategy or anything like that as they shifted there? 
W. McMullen: No, not to the extent that you would think. It was a completely different person before. They do a better job on the basics. They also will consolidate stores. They ended up selling off some stores, things like that, but it's -- every transaction is different. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo. 
Todd Duvick: Just looking at cash flow for 2014, can you tell us after the Harris Teeter acquisition, whether or not you expect working capital to be either a use or a source of cash? And can you give us kind of an order of magnitude? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, we continue to do a really good job on our working capital usage. If you look at the consolidated balance sheet, the way we look at it, and it's the balance sheet with Harris Teeter combined into it. We had just about $75 million or $80 million reduction in working capital overall for the year and we still have plans in place of things that we think could continue to improve that. We wouldn't budget in dramatic improvements and have that in expectation of as a source of cash, but we would expect to have some benefit from it. 
Todd Duvick: Okay, that's helpful. And then I think you also indicated that you expect to contribute about $250 million to the multiemployer pension plans this year, and I assume that includes Harris Teeter. Can you confirm that? And can you tell us if there are multiemployer pension -- I guess, obligations were materially larger than your overall obligations? 
J. Schlotman: Harris Teeter is not a party or not a member of any of the multiemployer funds. They're 100% employee choice. So I guess, that would be total company, the contributions, but none of it has reflected the result of the merger with Harris Teeter. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Mike, my question for you is on CapEx. I don't think it was asked. But your guidance, Mike, looks like it calls for about, I don't know, maybe a $600 million increase in CapEx. I think Harris Teeter, based on what they've shown historically, could be a couple hundred of that. And you know what, obviously, your longer-term guidance was an additional $200 million a year. So could you just kind of help us understand where the increase in CapEx is coming from? 
J. Schlotman: Sure. If you go back to our December call, we were projecting a point estimate of $2.4 billion for this year. We came in at $2.3 billion. Some of that is just a little delay on some projects that caused it to be a little behind where we expect it. We would expect that catch-up to happen in 2014. So if you think about 2014 going off of a $2.4 billion base, the $200 million increase that we would've expected on an annual basis would get you to $2.6 billion. And then adding in the activity for Harris Teeter, which will probably be a little higher than the number you used, may continue to have some attractive opportunities and their own forecast would have had their CapEx continuing to grow because they were growing their company. That's really how we got the build up to $2.8 billion to $3 billion. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then as we think about sort of beyond this maybe like '15, I -- we probably shouldn't throw $200 million on top of '14 number because of the catch-up, I guess, is how to think about it. 
J. Schlotman: It's a little early to give 2015 guidance, but for planning purposes at this point, I would be thinking about another $200 million internally. 
W. McMullen: And Ed, the thing we're really focused on, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, is the incremental capital we're spending, what returns are we getting for that and what's our ability to execute at that higher level because obviously it creates jobs and we have to find associates to staff those stores and run those stores. And as long as we're feeling good about being able to help develop our associates to run the stores and their performance continues to be strong, we would continue to expect to continue to increase capital. 
J. Schlotman: And as we said, we're coming close to picking a market to go into organically, which will take some capital as well. 
Edward Kelly: And just a follow-up on that, Mike and Rodney, when you think about a new market, what are the dynamics that you're really sort of looking for to make that decision in terms of where you ultimately go? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we look at a wide range of topics, including the competitive landscape. We look at where the market may be situated compared to our existing infrastructure. It would be very nice if it winds up being a market that our current logistics and manufacturing systems can supply product to them, again, the dynamics of the market, not just the competitive landscape, but the growth that you see in a potential market. And then some customer research of what it is the customer wants from a grocery retailer and how we have been able to perform against that over time in the markets where we already operate. So it's a very long list of things. Those would be amongst the bigger. 
Operator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rodney McMullen for closing remarks. 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Glenn. Before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. First, I'd like to welcome our Harris Teeter associates to The Kroger family. We couldn't be happier. I'd also like to thank our associates for your hard work in connection with our customers. We finished 2013 strong because of your hard work to provide friendly service and fresh products to every customer every time, every day. You also helped keep costs under control so we can reinvest the savings in things that matter most to our customers. They are taking note of your efforts and giving us credit for making a difference. Special thanks to each and every one of you for all you do for our customers and each other.
 This week, we will host our third annual associate recognition event in Cincinnati. Our 33 associate honorees come from across the company, including our retail divisions, fee stores, manufacturing and logistics facilities, Fred Meyer Jewelry, the Little Clinic and general office. They will be recognized during this 2-day event for their friendly service, strong leadership, dedication to their community and courage in the fight against cancer. 
 Finally, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dave Dillon, for his leadership and the powerful foundation he and our team have put in place. I am humbled to be serving as your CEO and excited to work with our outstanding leadership team. We're not done serving our customers, growing our business and performing for shareholders. Indeed, we're just getting started. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining us, and thank you for all you do to partner with Kroger. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2014 Q3  (2013-12-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Schlotman, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. 
J. Schlotman: Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Cindy can't join us today, so I'm going to do the introductory comments. Her daughter, Grace, is actually having an emergency appendectomy as we speak, and I haven't violated any HIPAA rules by disclosing that. Cindy was okay with me telling you why she couldn't be here.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 Thanks again to those of you who are able to join us for our 2000 (sic) Investor Conference in New York on October 30. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and soon-to-be CEO; and as you've already heard, Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the call today is Mike Ellis, Kroger's Senior Vice President and soon-to-be President and Chief Operating Officer.
 Our third quarter results were quite strong and helped ensure that 2013 will be another great year. Team Kroger continues to fuel our accelerated growth by performing with consistency and discipline. The resiliency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for shareholders and customers was on full display during the quarter even as our internal research shows that customers remain uncertain about the economy.
 We expanded rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We increased return on invested capital while increasing capital investment, and we lowered operating costs as a percent of sales. And once again, this quarter, our associates' disciplined performance resulted in positive identical sales in every operating division and every store department.
 Overall, our quarterly results show once again that Kroger is uniquely positioned to grow and win in the U.S. food retail industry.
 I am most proud, however, of another distinctive achievement, team Kroger's 40th consecutive quarter of positive identical sales. It is not simply the scorecard that makes this meaningful, although 10 full years without skipping a beat is extraordinary. What makes 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales so remarkable is the underlying importance of the metric.
 For retailers, identical sales are the strongest indication of whether or not we are connecting with our customers over time. Every one of our 343,000 associates deserves recognition for their individual work to achieve this unprecedented milestone. Congratulations. I know our entire team is hard at work to achieve the 41st.
 We are pleased with where our business is trending, pleased with the growth of our loyal households and pleased with our business during the Halloween and important Thanksgiving holiday, all of which give us confidence that we will achieve our full year earnings per share and identical supermarket sales guidance.
 Looking forward to 2014, we expect our earnings per share growth rate to be 8% to 11%, excluding the effect of the Harris Teeter merger and tax benefits, which is consistent with our long-term growth objective. I'll now hand off to Rodney for more details on the third quarter performance and consumer sentiment. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did a terrific job executing our Customer 1st Strategy in the third quarter. We improved our connection with customers, especially our most loyal shoppers and are receiving more credit from our customers because of our strong progress to improve our fresh products and customer service. As you know, these areas are important aspects of our 4 keys.
 Before we discuss our loyal customer growth for the quarter, I want to highlight that Kroger has consistently grown loyal households for the last -- the past 10 years. We estimate that since 2003, loyal households have increased by an outstanding 83%. That means today, compared to a decade ago, 83% more households are shopping with greater print [ph], purchasing more items from our stores. Focusing on our most loyal customers has been a real key to reaching 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales.
 In the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores because on average, we only capture $0.50 of every $1 loyal customer spend on products we sell. In the third quarter, loyal customers drove total sales gains in line with our strategy.
 Our strong identical sales in the quarter were largely driven by the increases in total and loyal households. Total units in the quarter were up compared to last year, although items per trip continues to trend down as it has for the last couple of years. We believe this is a reflection of changes in shopping patterns that began with the economic downturn and have now become the norm. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.5%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 As Dave mentioned earlier, we had positive identical sales in every department. These sales were exceptionally strong in produce and natural foods. These gains confirm that our Customer 1st investments in our products are working as intended and creating sustainable competitive advantages for Kroger.
 We continue to invest to meet our customers' health and wellness needs, and this is evident in our pharmacy and the Little Clinic businesses. We are very pleased with the strong gains we've made when our pharmacy team seized the opportunity created by the dispute between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and even more pleased with the scripts that we've retained. By nearly every measure, our pharmacy team took advantage of that opportunity and ran with it. The Little Clinic likewise continues to see strong growth.
 Many of our customers are feeling the stress of an economy that is only slowly improving, and they are not immune to the episodic ups and downs that create uncertainty. There are a number of factors impacting an already fragile consumer sentiment, including government gridlock, various concerns about health care, and it remains to be seen how the reduction in SNAP benefits will impact the entire U.S. retail industry. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks.
 What little economic recovery there is remains bifurcated. For some of our customers, the economy is markedly improved. But for others, there are no -- there has been no noticeable improvement at all. While these factors are creating more uncertainty than we normally have, we have never been more confident in our business model and we continue to gain market share. This is because of the remarkable consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy. No matter the environment, our customers and shareholders can depend on Kroger to deliver value. Our ability to make constant adjustments based on what we see in the environment and what our customers are facing has defined Kroger, in our customer's eyes, as a place they can rely on in good times and in tough times.
 We continue to personalize and merchandise in ways that solve for the needs of all of our customers. For the customer under stress, we are offering low entry price point on key items and special low prices on seasonal items, especially in corporate brands. And for all our customers are -- and all our customers are benefiting from better service and more value through lower prices on organic and natural foods, including Simple Truth, as well as our digital promotions, fuel rewards and health and wellness offerings.
 Corporate brands continued to gain market share during the third quarter as well, with corporate brands representing approximately 26.1% of total units sold, and sales dollars were 24.1%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter, as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs are -- costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the adjustment items for 2012 and '13 decreased 27 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. We are on track to deliver our ninth consecutive year of leveraging operating costs.
 Before I turn it over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on labor relations. Our store associate ratified new labor agreements covering stores in Little Rock, Dallas and Seattle. We are currently negotiating our contract in Cincinnati, which is on extension until March 1. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.
 Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, plus enhance job security for all associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we have added 33,000 jobs.
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.2% to $22.5 billion in the quarter compared to $21.8 billion for the same period last year. We know there are estimates out there that are higher than our total sales, but it's important to keep in mind that the retail price per gallon of fuel was down 8% for the quarter. This is why we look at sales excluding fuel, which increased 4.7% in the third quarter over the same period last year.
 Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain adjustments. This year's third quarter includes a net $0.04 per diluted share benefit that is comprised of $0.05 from certain tax items, partially offset by expenses related to Kroger's pending merger with Harris Teeter.
 Last year's third quarter included a $0.14 per share benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and from a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January of 2012. Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.53 per diluted share in the third quarter this year and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.
 FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.57% of sales in the third quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $15 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. The company continues to estimate its full year LIFO charge at $55 million.
 FIFO operating profit margin, excluding fuel, the 53rd week last year and the adjustment items in fiscal 2012 and 2013 on a rolling 4-quarters basis increased 11 basis points. On this basis and for the full year, we can continue to expect our non-fuel FIFO operating margin to expand slightly.
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About 1/2 of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers' rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.141 compared to $0.133 a year ago. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.
 We increased our return on invested capital on a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, recording a 13.42% return on invested capital this year compared to 13.34% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.
 Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating; repurchase shares; have a growing dividend; and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $8.2 billion, a decrease of $525 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, Kroger's net total-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 1.86 compared to 2.08 during the same period last year.
 During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 3.6 million common shares for a total investment of $148 million. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has returned more than $752 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends as a result of our strong financial position.
 Capital investment, excluding purchases of leased property, totaled $641 million for the third quarter compared to $474 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.8 billion. We expect full year capital investments to be approximately $2.4 billion.
 As you know, we plan to continue increasing capital investment over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and ROIC. This fill-in strategy is a continuation of efforts that have been underway for some time and include a new focus on markets such as Dallas, Texas and the state of Michigan.
 Stores we have opened in the earlier fill-in markets are producing results in line with our expectations, giving us the confidence to add new fill-in markets. Additionally, we will continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically.
 Next, I would like to update you on our pending merger with Harris Teeter. To say we are excited about the prospects of our companies joining together would be an understatement. We know this is going to be an outstanding combination that will benefit our customers, associates and shareholders.
 The merger is proceeding as planned. Both Kroger and Harris Teeter are having productive conversations with the FTC staff. We believe we are still on track to close the transaction before the end of Kroger's fiscal 2013.
 Now I'll update you on our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Excluding certain tax items and expenses related to our pending merger with Harris Teeter and assuming a LIFO charge consistent with our current estimate, we expect EPS to be up -- for the year, to be up in the range of $2.73 to $2.80. That's our current range. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.
 While these are fairly large ranges with one quarter to go, several factors, including the reduced SNAP benefits, a shorter holiday selling season and slow economic recovery, make it a little more difficult to precisely predict the fourth quarter. Regardless of where we finish in the range, it will be a very strong year, demonstrating the strength of our Customer 1st Strategy. I want to echo Dave and Rodney's thanks to all of our associates for your hard work to deliver what will turn out to be a very good year.
 We do realize such a wide range of potential earnings per share results this late in the year can be somewhat confusing. It could also raise questions about where our trends are going into next year. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver 2014 results in line with our 8% to 11% earnings per share growth targets. This is why Dave discussed 2014 expectations. Normally we would not talk about this until our year end release in March, but felt it was important to be clear about the underlying confidence we have in our team and the future.
 Now I'll turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered strong across-the-board performance in the third quarter. More importantly, we demonstrated the consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for customers and shareholders alike.
 Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our investors. As you know, Rodney will become CEO on January 1. While I will continue to serve as Chairman through the end of next year, Rodney will take the lead on the call next quarter.
 I've appreciated our dialogue through the years. You have made me a better retailer as we envisioned our future. I hope you will continue to invest in Kroger in the years to come. I know I will. I could not be more confident in Kroger's future, knowing that our entire leadership team and Rodney McMullen will guide Kroger to even higher levels of performance. Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Maybe just the first question to start out. Mike, you talked about the wider range in the fourth quarter. There's not really a wide range around the ID expectation. So is that more around gross margin? And does that say anything about competitive environment and what you're sort of thinking about there? Maybe just a little bit of help on that front. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think it's really -- that it's necessarily an increase in the competitive environment out there. It's always been a competitive industry. I think it's really -- the thing that's a little difficult to read at this point in time is exactly what the effect of the SNAP reduction will be. It's early in that process. While it's been a full month with November behind us, it's a little difficult to extrapolate November. With the Thanksgiving and holiday selling season in that month, it's always a big selling season and people always find ways to have a good holiday celebration. That, coupled with the shorter holiday selling season of between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as just the slow economic recovery, it's just really difficult to predict. As Rodney had mentioned, we see great volatility of sales by day and by week, and it's just a little difficult to predict exactly where we're going to fall in the range. But again, wherever we fall -- wind up falling inside that range for the year on EPS, it's going to be a very solid year and one within our 8% to 11% guidance. 
Edward Kelly: And to the extent the economy -- I mean, you sort of hinted that it's harder, but how do IDs look so far in Q4? 
David Dillon: Let me answer that, Ed, because I'd like to actually give you a little perspective. I want to look at how they flowed through the third quarter and then bring you up-to-date in the current quarter. In the third quarter, they were stronger earlier in the quarter, a little less strong near the end. However, so far in the fourth quarter, we are running slightly higher than the sales guidance that we've just given. But I want to add, I wouldn't read an awful lot into where we are currently because of the unpredictable nature of the things that Mike just described, the calendar, SNAP benefits and the impact of health care. Uncertainty has -- all of those create uncertainty for the consumer, and as a result, create some unpredictability. So we're optimistic, as you can see. That's why I wanted to give you that perspective on how the sales have emerged so far this quarter. 
Edward Kelly: Is there any way to sort of quantify what you think SNAP has done so far? 
W. McMullen: So far, in November, you can see where SNAP dollars are down, but customers are substituting and buying with cash that shortfall. So the trend so far for that customer hasn't changed, but the way they're paying for their product has changed. How much of that is at the expense of other consumption items would be pure speculation. As you know, the other thing that's helping the economy and everyone is fuel prices are lower this year than a year ago, so some of that savings or benefit or whatever you want to call, is probably coming from there as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. 
Steven Forbes: It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. If we take a look at natural and organic foods, you mentioned the strength this quarter. And I guess, we're just hoping if you can provide some additional color on the current size of that business today. 
W. McMullen: How do I do this in a way that is helpful for you, but not gives up competitive advantages? It's a meaningful part of our business. And it would be, I don't know, probably our sixth or seventh largest department. But it's by far the fastest-growing department on a percentage basis, and sometimes even on a dollar basis it's one of the bigger departments. I don't know, Dave or Mike, if you can think of any other way to give a little bit better insight. 
David Dillon: I think the interesting thing to me is we're such a big company and seeing the growth of that inside our company, you hardly are able to see it the way we do. But it's been a fabulous part of our business. We are pleased. It certainly indicates where customers are headed and have suggested that what we're offering, they really like. 
W. McMullen: If you look at our natural -- the competitors out there that focus purely on natural foods, we would be the second-largest retailer out there on a stand-alone basis by a pretty large margin. We would not be bigger than the largest in that space. 
Steven Forbes: Okay. Then I guess, if we could just talk generally about, I mean, how you view the market share opportunity, I mean, maybe taking a brand like Simple Truth, I guess, the mature share or how the share develops over time, do you see the ability to get to, say, double the nonorganic categories of overall market share? And then just lastly, if you could just briefly touch on the margin structure and how did that look compared to the more conventional categories as well? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the market share opportunities, for us, we can easily see how that business could double from where we are today. And if I understood the question right, you were direct at just Simple Truth, but that comment is, when I look at natural foods and organics overall when I make that comment. But we don't see it as something that's a dream to double our business. We actually have a pretty good plan in place that will get us significantly along the way on getting there in a reasonable period of time. The margins on the business, it's still -- it's a little bit better than the margins on the conventional business, but it's not hugely different. And like in produce, you'll see us more and more pricing a lot of the organic items at the same price as conventional certainly in certain markets. So we're driven because that's where our customer's headed. We think the growth there is because customers overall, our existing customers continue to buy more and more organic and natural foods, plus the younger generation buys a higher share in those categories. So we see a huge opportunity and we see it exciting and we have some great products to offer there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Kroger (sic) [Barclays]. 
Unknown Analyst: This is actually Jack Moore [ph] calling on behalf of Meredith. I guess, I wanted to see what your strategy is more broadly around the new markets that you have recently announced investments in, including the Dallas market, the Michigan and Detroit and then also in Cincinnati. And how would you prioritize the kind of acceleration of investment in those markets? And where do you see the expansion going forward? 
W. McMullen: It's really a combination of several things. It's markets where we see, from a competitive standpoint, an opportunity to gain share because there are certain things that we offer in the market that our competitors may not be offering. We have a good relationship with our associates. And we have a competitive cost structure where we can afford to invest and give the customer a good value and be very strong in the marketplace. So it's a combination of all those things together. It isn't necessarily driven by the economic growth in the market, but we do see, like in Dallas, a great -- that economy there in Dallas/Fort Worth has a huge growth in front of it. 
Unknown Analyst: And the second question would be, would you consider your strategy to be an aggressive offensive type of strategy in these markets or more of a defensive market share protection? How would you characterize and I guess, maybe more granularly by each of those 3 to 4 new markets that are expanding? 
W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at the markets you've identified, I feel very comfortable to call all of them offensive. We see great opportunities to get a good return on our investment and grow the business there. So I would characterize as all of them offense in nature. I don't know, if Dave, would you... 
David Dillon: I not only would characterize it that way, I would even think about it from the point of view of we look at market share more as we can grow our connection with the customer better. I would, and Rodney did the same, is I wouldn't use your term aggressive because that sort of implies you're going to come in and try to stomp on competitors, and that's not the idea. The idea is we attract our customers better, we serve our customers better. That they like what they're having, and that's the relevancy. The customers that we've talked about for so many years. And that's the essence of really of our strategy. So it is definitely offensive and it works exactly like Rodney described. 
W. McMullen: And the other thing is we have a great foundation of associates in these markets. And by -- as you're building new stores, you create a lot of job opportunities for people to get promoted. And what we're finding is we have a lot of associates that are ready to continue to grow to take on more responsibilities. So it's a double win and our shareholders get a good return because we find there's a high correlation between the higher our market share, the higher our return on investment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: If we're looking at the gasoline business, thanks for the data on that, but as gas prices have come down, what has been the customer response to it? Is it still looking as an important reward? Are they buying more gallons because it's cheaper at a better margin? Can you talk about that a little bit? 
David Dillon: I'll just mention on gas, as we've said, and Mike or Rodney may want to add to that, but we've said gas is -- fuel is an important part of our business for a variety of reasons. Our gallons were up nicely. We feel -- we continue to feel really good about where we're positioned. But gasoline being a large purchase out of a family's budget, even at these lower prices, is still significant to -- and important to them to have the fuel rewards that we offer. And it's important to have a convenient place to refuel at a really competitive price. I just filled up the last 2 weeks twice at getting $1.05 off a gallon. And I can tell you that even in my case, I smile when I'm driving away from the gas pump. So it makes a difference. Rodney or Mike, do you want to add anything? Okay. 
Charles Cerankosky: Can you quantify what the gallon lift was in the quarter? 
David Dillon: Mike, do you want to give any color to that? 
J. Schlotman: It was mid-single-digit gallon growth. That's total, not IDs because, as you know, we continue to add a lot of supermarket fuel centers in existing markets that cannibalizes the existing stores a little bit. But it's -- we are very pleased with the direction of the gallons that we're selling in a market that's not growing anywhere near that much. 
W. McMullen: And identicals were positive. 
J. Schlotman: Identicals were positive as well. 
W. McMullen: Correct. 
Charles Cerankosky: Okay. How about the mix of gallons at full price versus the reward price? 
David Dillon: I don't think we give that out ever, do we? 
J. Schlotman: We haven't. 
David Dillon: And I don't think we're going to start now. 
J. Schlotman: The good news is I'm not even tempted to give it to you because I don't know the number off the top of my head. 
David Dillon: But thank you for asking. 
Charles Cerankosky: Yes, I try. On the convenience stores, can you give us a little update on how that business is tracking and some of the, call them, experimental formats, you've been looking at, have been trending? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at the core business, that continues to grow and their consecutive identical sales growth quarters is actually longer than the 40 that Kroger has achieved overall, and they continued with their streak. On the experimental formats, I would say right now, we're continuing to learn a lot. And it's still early in the process and Mike Ellis and Chris Hjelm have actually been heading it up, and we've actually recently restructured some of our internal operation structure to get more focus on it. I could tell you we still remain excited about the opportunity, but we haven't found something that I think our shareholders would be excited about the opportunity yet. But we think there's something there and we continue to learn a lot. 
Charles Cerankosky: Comment on general merchandise sales during the quarter and what that might be telling you about where the customer is headed. And I'm not trying to get in a prediction of holiday sales, but the sort of quarter year-over-year third quarter and how the general merch sales are tracking? 
J. Schlotman: One of the important metrics would be, as you look at general merchandise, probably the best metric would be the Fred Meyer Group had an outstanding Black Friday. By the end of that day, they were very pleased with the ID sales growth they had, not important holiday for the general merchandise merchants. And they feel like they're set up very well to have a strong holiday season. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: And Dave, congratulations. 
David Dillon: Thank you. 
Scott Mushkin: We're going to miss you on the calls. 
David Dillon: Thank you. 
Scott Mushkin: But enjoy your retirement and your grandkids. So I guess, I want to go back to what Ed was focused in on in the first question. Because if I -- and I really appreciate, Mike, you giving us some kind of thought process on the fourth quarter. But I guess what pops into my head is kind of what's changed? In other words, kind of new about SNAP. And I mean, when we were at your Analyst Day, we also -- I think I asked about the days that were going to go missing and we kind of knew about it. So I guess, what I'm trying to understand, it seems like you're a little bit more cautious about the fourth quarter, generally. I just wanted to understand what's kind of maybe changed in your -- even though your sales are running, I guess, over 3.5% right now. So what's changed? 
David Dillon: Let me add a comment or 2 and then Mike can add to that, Scott. The thing I think I want to emphasize is that we see the world as a little more unpredictable than it generally is. And the SNAP change that occurred, certainly, we knew at the investor conference what was going to happen but we didn't know what the outcome would be and we still don't actually know the outcome, and that's what makes it unpredictable. And the more we think about it, we think it's -- there's a lot of ways in which it could be played out. We still believe, as we did in the investor conference, that customers' eating is a high priority, and so customers will tend to substitute other forms. So they'll pay in cash or credit card if they didn't have the food stamps and then they will give up on something else. And at the moment, as I think Rodney mentioned, they've been able to give up on fuel because the price of fuel is so low. But you don't know where that will lie in the longer term and we also don't know how the Christmas holiday plays out. The holiday calendar, of course, we knew that before, too. Now that it's right upon us and we're reflecting on it, we're not quite sure what it means. And then we watch every day the amount of uncertainty that our customers have generally, not just with SNAP and not just with holiday, but you look at the health care and some of those areas that we've discussed. It just created enough unpredictability for us that we felt we needed to take a little more cautious position. 
J. Schlotman: Okay. 
David Dillon: Okay. Now, Mike doesn't want to add anything more to that. So I think that's the only reason we felt that way. I don't want you to over-interpret what we've said because I'm actually quite optimistic. 
Scott Mushkin: Dave, I appreciate that. Is it something that -- because like you said, your business is running pretty strong right now. Is it behavior inside your stores where the week-to-week and what the consumer is buying? Or is it more of even though you guys are taking maybe even more share now, what's going on with some of your competitors... 
David Dillon: It's actually that when you look at the data, it's a little, it's more unpredictable, more variable than what we're used to. We've talked about this actually for quarters, where we've seen wider swings from week-to-week, especially first of the month and last of the month kind of swings. We've talked a lot about that. But we're even seeing now, in addition to the week-to-week, the daily kind of swings that are surprising. But still in the end, as you can see in the third quarter, in the end, it came out terrific. So maybe I'm over-reading it, but I just think that variability creates unpredictability, and unpredictability means we need to be a little bit more cautious. 
Scott Mushkin: That's terrific. And then if I could ask one about gross margins and kind of what your thought process vis-a-vis inflation, so I guess, kind of a 2-part question. I think you guys said about 1.5%. Where do you think that's going? And do you think we've had deflation before and people freak out thinking that something is wrong and tend to overinvest in price on top of it? Is that a concern and where do you think the inflation is going? And then I'll yield. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, you bet, Scott. Thanks. From an inflation standpoint, when you look at where -- let's just talk about the grocery categories since that's just such a big percentage of our sales. It's fairly remarkably consistent in the first, second and third quarter, all a little bit above 1% inflation. You look at individual periods inside there, and there's a little bit of variability, but it's been fairly consistent inflation in that grocery category. Some of the perishable categories have had a little bit more inflation during the year, causing that overall index to be a little bit higher. We really haven't experienced deflation and aren't predicting a deflationary environment for next year. Our expectation as we end this year and go into next year is probably inflationary pressure is about the same where we are today, a very low inflationary kind of period, which is a period we operated in for a very long period of time. There was a very long period of time until the last 3 or 4 years where there is virtually no inflation, and in some of those years actually had deflation. So we're comfortable with our ability to continue to execute and operate in this environment. One of the things that does cause us frustration when you see problems with inflation is when there's big variability in an inflation from inside every year from high inflation to deflation and swinging back. Those have been the periods of time where it's been difficult to manage through. But a consistent, little more than 1% in grocery. Yes, life's a little better with a little more. But when it's consistent, it's significantly easier to operate in that inconsistent environment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Wanted to get into a little bit what categories are working because it seems like if you look at Nielsen data and some of the other areas out there, the center of the store seems weak for the rest of the industry, yet you're saying all of your categories were still showing good IDs. So maybe if you could tell us color on the center of store versus the perimeter? 
David Dillon: Well, Rodney may want to add some color to this, but we've identified some of the strong growth areas that we have better than our average sales, places like produce, natural food. I don't think we've mentioned. Well, we did mention pharmacy. It's also true in deli and seafood. But -- and natural food has a number of items that are within the center of the store so that would be partially part of your answer. We're also seeing a really strong or improved trends anyway and very strong in some, but the categories that are more discretionary, which illustrates the bifurcated nature of the economic recovery, things like Starbucks and sushi and Boar's Head and some of the upscale cheese. Greeting cards are doing reasonably well and toys are too, both of which are in the center of the store. And Rodney, you may want to add some more color to where you see that. 
W. McMullen: No, I would agree. If you look at -- it's kind of hard how you define center store anymore. Dave's comment about natural foods is one where I always struggle with because technically, it probably is center of store. That would be -- the center store is the weaker part of our business, but it has been for a long period of time because people are buying more and more -- they want dinner prepared and they just come in and pick something up. So there's all kinds of shifts going on, but we continue to gain good share in what business is there. And it really is just moving -- adapting as the market changes. And Mike reminded me that grocery units continue to grow, so it's still positive. Don't take too much into what I said. 
David Dillon: Yes, and the important note is that we sell both. 
W. McMullen: Well, it's really important to be positioned to take advantage of both because it's left up to the customer what they want versus us trying to force them. 
Mark Wiltamuth: And if you dig in a little bit on that natural food category, are you still adding aisle space and SKUs to that area or is it really just more higher turns of existing products? 
W. McMullen: It's a good question and it's really both. We continue to -- there's a lot of product innovation in those areas, so you find a lot of good new products that you can add that customers like. We continue to find subcategories within it that we haven't had in the past that's doing very well that we continue to add. Plus if you look at the base business, it just continues to grow. So you have all those things happening. We are continuing to add space to those, to that department when you look across the company. 
Mark Wiltamuth: And are those more focused on your upscale stores or is this actually creeping more into some of the core stores also? 
W. McMullen: This would be all stores. The amount of it would be different. But a value store would have changes as well. It isn't focused just on upscale by no means. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Dave, I just want to add my congratulations on everything you've achieved in the last 10 years or so at Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Andrew. 
Andrew Wolf: A couple of follow-ups. First, at the end of the quarter, when things got weak, could you tie that or would you tie that to using focus groups or your own intuition or whatever, to the uncertainty around the government shutdown? Do you think that was the primary reason October sort of softened for your business? 
David Dillon: Well, my intuition says it was a variety of things. There was a modest change in the calendar in such a way that, that might have affected it a little bit. I think that there was some differences in our own merchandising from last year to this year, not a lot, but enough that you could maybe see a little difference in it. And then third is the point you raised is I think there were a lot of unpredictable things going on and causing people to be uncertain. I know for sure that in some retailers, you could see a clear change in sales performance when the government was shut down because of the wildly uncertain market that created for some people. And the categories that were within that retailer would have been within our store, and we didn't see quite [indiscernible] and we certainly didn't see that kind of a variation in our total sales or even any one department. But I think each of those things go together, conspire together to create what I think is probably going to be an anomaly. But it illustrated to me how unpredictable some of these events may be. And that's probably what makes me a little cautious. It doesn't make me negative, it makes me cautious about predicting, not cautious about what the future will actually be. That's why I emphasized I'm actually quite optimistic. 
Andrew Wolf: Yes, I think that's a good segue into my real -- my primary question, which is around the sort of ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the kind of machinations it's changing and as it's going -- the rules that are coming out and all that's going on. So we've had our conference recently. It seems to be, especially from the corporate viewpoints, creating a lot of consternation about the consumer, about take-home checks, are those going to change January 1 materially, and really about corporate cost structure. So sure you guys have put a lot of time and energy into this. I know there's a lot of uncertainty around it. But I wonder if you could just share with us right now and I know this will change over time kind of your best thinking around the consumer, what it's going to mean for the consumer and what it could mean for Kroger's cost structure. Maybe it's a positive thing relative to nonunion businesses, but I'd just like to hear what you think about that. 
David Dillon: Well, I have a couple of thoughts and recognizing it's early and as you point out, it makes things a little hard to know for sure. But the first thing is that everyone will be affected in a similar kind of a way. I don't think Kroger will be singled out in any particular way either in advantage or disadvantage. And as a result, if it ends up being worse than I'm mentally thinking, then it's worse for everybody than it is -- it's just not Kroger. But also what we're seeing early on so far is our estimates and the way we've played out the future is consistent with what we have been thinking and what we've been feeling, meaning our cost will go up a little bit, it's going to be manageable, it's within the context of what we see as our long-term earnings guidance. And it doesn't change our confidence level at all about what our future looks like and our ability to perform. The short-term effect, the effect on uncertainty and unpredictability for the customer and whether that changes their behavior, that actually could be a short-term issue, it certainly could be a long-term issue too, if I'm wrong. But the short-term issue is more because of the unpredictable nature, does that cause the customer to be more cautious themselves and their behavior. That's what many people felt happened with the government shutdown. And then, of course, once that got back to normal, then a lot of the business looks like it kind of recovered and came back to normal, too. Rodney, I don't know. You and I have talked a little bit about that. You want to add any... 
W. McMullen: No. No, there are some customers that will probably end up saving money as well. If you were in one of the groups where you were paying more for premiums than under the new structure, so there's some people that's on the other side of that as well. So I think Dave's point on unpredictable in terms of how the customers are going to react, I think the customer doesn't even know how they're going to react yet, because they're still trying to understand what does it mean. 
David Dillon: Yes. Now, you did mention the union, nonunion picture and of course, we have a number of collective bargaining agreements. And in those, it does create a little, I want to say a little bigger pressure on both parties, on the union bargainers and on the company bargainers, because there's certain changes you have to make because of the law. And when you make those, then that has cost implications and then that puts pressure on the rest of the contract to make whatever other changes you have to make to adjust for that. And I could see the argument that might put a union operator at a competitive disadvantage. I don't happen to feel that way but I can certainly see the argument. Because I think what it really does is it causes the parties at the bargaining table to try to face reality and say, "How are we going to collectively negotiate this out and compromise this out in a way that works for the law and works for our associates and works for the company?" And that's been our objective and so far, we've been pleased with being able to do that. 
Andrew Wolf: I just want to get one follow-up on a question a few folks, including Mark Wiltamuth, I think asked on where the natural food growth is coming, velocity versus expansion. And really, Rodney, I think you said the business could double and I clearly see that that's more than likely. But would you -- could you put a time frame around that, bracket it? Would it be closer to 10 years, closer to 5 years, within which you predict, I know not to the year, but what -- would it be closer to one or the other? 
W. McMullen: I would say it's closer to 5. Now Mike Ellis is over there cringing because if you -- I would be pushing him to maybe get there a little faster. 
Michael Ellis: True. 
W. McMullen: But definitely, I would see it in the next 5 years' time frame. 
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: ;
 I just wanted to ask a couple more housekeeping-related questions. On your comp this quarter and also on your gross margin, what was the impact of generics this quarter? Have we finally cycled that completely or are there still some impact on the comps? 
J. Schlotman: With and without pharmacy numbers, without pharmacy, we were a little bit stronger without it when you take pharmacy out of our sales along with fuel so there was still a slight impact on the ID sales as a result of the pharmacy department. It wasn't [indiscernible] certainly declining. 
Karen Short: So it should be fully cycled by '14? 
J. Schlotman: It's not meaningful. It's not meaningful anymore, it's so small. 
Karen Short: Okay. So the gross margin deterioration that we saw this quarter, now that we've more or less cycled the generic benefit on the gross, is that kind of -- is that our I should think about the gross margin deterioration this quarter? Like it was obviously less in the first and second and then now it's just taking a little bit of a step up, not that meaningful, but it's [indiscernible] 
J. Schlotman: I would characterize where our gross wound up a little different than deterioration when you look at the cost savings, the total operating cost savings that Rodney spoke of when we look at OG&A plus rent and depreciation, we clearly paid for our investments in gross. And we continue to strive the balance on our rolling 4-quarters basis, the investments we make in gross and the reductions in our cost. And as we've always said, individual quarters can have different results than the full year happens to have. And I wouldn't take one quarter and try to extrapolate that. I would look more where we've been on a rolling 4-quarters basis or on an annual basis so far this year. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then looking at your CapEx, you brought your CapEx spend up to the high -- well, to the high end of the range, but it seems like the projects that you have, have kind of remained unchanged. Anything to point to there because it was $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion? 
J. Schlotman: Well, just that we -- where we sit today, having spent $1.8 billion year-to-date, it's more likely than not that we're going to be in that $2.4 billion range. When you look at the number of projects, the major projects may not be appreciably different as a result of that. We're doing a lot of smaller remodels that don't fall into the major project category. Plus we're having a lot of spending in 2013 on 2014 projects, so we can get them opened earlier in the year. And that is something we continually work on, is to not look at those budgets necessarily that you budgeted to open in '14. So spend all your dollars in '14. So there is quite a bit of pre-spend on 2014 openings. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then last question is when you actually close on Harris Teeter, will you provide updated guidance at that time or are you going to wait until you report your fourth quarter? 
J. Schlotman: My view is that considering that it will be by the end of our fiscal year, which means by the end of January, we'll probably take February to sit down with them. It's a little difficult today to have even conversations with them about what their business plans should look like next year relative to the FTC will be concerned. We're trying to run their business and we haven't closed on the merger. So my expectation is we'll take the month of February to sit down with the management team at Harris Teeter to solidify jointly what their business plan should look like for 2014 and then give combined guidance when we release earnings for the full year in March. 
W. McMullen: But the accretion for the first full year would be consistent with what we talked about before. 
J. Schlotman: Absolutely, there's nothing that we know of or would expect to know of that would cause the $0.06 to $0.09 to be different. 
David Dillon: Yes, great, Karen. Thank you very much. And before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional brief thoughts with our associates, who we encourage to listen. 10 years of positive identical sales growth is simply amazing, and I'm proud to be a part of an organization that is committed to serving our customers and enriching the lives of others. As I've said earlier, each of us had a role to play in reaching this milestone. It is one you should each be proud of. And thank you all for what you do to make our stores the best place in which to shop during the holidays. Remember the little things like a smile and a friendly greeting always make a customer's day better. And actually, they make our day better, too. I hope each of you celebrate the holidays with family and friends. We wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. That completes the call today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2014 Q2  (2013-09-12 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Kroger Company Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Derek. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2013 Investor Conference in New York on October 30. We look forward to seeing many of you then.
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.
 With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 I am very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which puts us on target to deliver the identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth we promised for the year. Kroger's second quarter operating performance and financial results show that the common thread in our story is consistency.
 We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, maintained return on invested capital and expanded FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Every supermarket division and every department had positive ID sales.
 We controlled costs throughout the business. As you know, we announced a merger agreement with Harris Teeter, a company we have admired for a long time, which will expand Kroger's footprint into new exciting growth markets. And customers continue to tell us our associates are improving their shopping experience.
 As we've shown quarter after quarter, our consistent execution of the Customer 1st Strategy deepens customer loyalty, increases sales and creates sustainable shareholder value. As you know, the list that I've just covered was prepared in advance so that we could formally review the quarter that we just finished. I'm not sure it does the quarter justice, so let me depart from our normal script and describe our results this way.
 We've just completed what is nearly 10 years of positive identical sales growth. We have invested in price for each of those 10 years when compared to the year before. At the same time, we focused on lowering our costs. We've actually lowered our costs now for over 8 consecutive years.
 Last year, in our investor meeting, we raised the guidance for our long-term earnings performance expectations. In fact, for the past 2 years, and our guidance suggests that this 2013 would be the third year, we've been performing within this new higher earnings per share growth range already. Plus, don't forget the dividends.
 Also, last October, we offered a number of other keys to our successful growth plans for future years. Everything you're hearing today in our quarter suggests we're on the path to successfully achieve all of those goals that we set out for you last year in October.
 Maybe even more important, the progress we've achieved these past 10 years sets a wonderful foundation on which to build for an even brighter future. And the most important part of all is that the team at Kroger is large, broad-based, with dedicated associates, team Kroger, who have collectively come together to achieve these results. And it is that combination that I think is unmatched in the industry today.
 The results achieved by our team, team Kroger, make me most proud. I don't use words lightly, this quarter especially, when I say we are very proud of the quarter we have just delivered.
 Now I'd like Rodney to cover some more details about the second quarter. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we regularly seek customer feedback on how well we are executing in each of the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st Strategy. We continue to improve our performance in each area and our efforts are being noticed. Customers are telling us that our associates continue to connect with them by showing them that our people are great, our product selection and quality is improving, we are making the shopping experience faster and easier and we continue to give our customers better value for their money.
 Doing the 4 keys together is what separates us from our competitors, competitors of both the past and the future, because the hard part is doing all 4 and doing them reliably. We are also more agile in balancing our investments in the 4 keys with the savings we realize and we are consistently improving the efficiency of those investments on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Our lower gross profit rate today means customers are saving nearly $3 billion a year compared to when we started this journey.
 I want to echo Dave's appreciation and also thank our associates for keeping their focus on our customers and delivering shareholder value. We are very proud of reaching a merger agreement with Harris Teeter and we are especially pleased it has not diverted our associates' efforts to achieve a good quarter and continuing -- continue to driving the business.
 One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth. It lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. And our loyal customers, on average, spend about half of every $1 with Kroger, which means we have tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores.
 During the second quarter, we grew the number of loyal households. Our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.
 Overall, customers continue to visit our stores more frequently, purchase fewer items per trip and buy more on a monthly basis. Total units sold were up compared to last year. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.6%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 As we've discussed throughout the year, and in fact for the last several years, consumer confidence continues to improve but at a slow and steady pace.  Factors that affect consumer confidence at any given time include fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty, along with the overall state of the economy. We continue to monitor these factors closely.
 Overall, we would characterize the economy as continue to improve but fragile.
 Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 17 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis and excluding one-time items, as Dave mentioned before, we've improved this metric for 8 consecutive years and our year-to-date results have set us up to achieve our ninth consecutive year.
 Now I'd like to update you on our corporate brands offering, which is one of our key differentiators for Kroger versus our competition. Our focus is on new products, which we are continually evolving as customer tastes change. We have modeled our team to facilitate a culture of innovation. This year alone, we will have introduced more than 650 new items by the end of the year.
 In the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 24.5% of total units sold and sales dollars were 23.8%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.
 Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified new labor agreements, covering stores in Indianapolis, Roanoke and Little Rock. We have several contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Seattle, Cincinnati and Dallas.
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. 
 Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will in turn help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.
 Total sales increased 4.6% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter compared with $21.7 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.9% in the second quarter over the same period last year.
 Net earnings for the second quarter totaled $317 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Net earnings for the second quarter of last year were $279 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.6 -- 20.46% of sales for the second quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 11 basis points from the same period last year.
 The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $35 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. This is consistent with our original expectations. FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012 on a rolling 4 quarters basis, increased 9 basis points.
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross profit rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today.
 In the second quarter, our supermarket centers -- our supermarket fuel center's rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.14 compared to $0.136 a year ago, excluding the 53rd week. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.
 On a rolling 52-week basis, return on invested capital grew slightly to 13.49% compared to 13.44% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to return on invested capital.
 Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments.
 You will see on our balance sheet that our current portion of long-term debt has decreased because of our recent financings and our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.77. We have not been repurchasing as many shares as we originally expected at the beginning of the year. This is purely because of our work to prepare for the Harris Teeter merger. This lower ratio gives us the flexibility to finance the Harris Teeter transaction and we are now well positioned to reestablish and maintain our targeted 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio, in line with our long-term financial strategy, within 18 months after the Harris Teeter transaction closes.
 In fact, this puts us in a better position than we originally expected from a debt standpoint. We are committed to executing our financial strategy, including maintaining our current investment grade rating and repurchasing shares.
 During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.4 million common shares for a total investment of $90 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $920 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters.
 Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased property, totaled $507 million for the quarter compared to $444 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.1 billion. We continue to expect full year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.
 Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.
 Keep in mind, our long-term growth rate assumes no effect from year-over-year LIFO swings. A higher LIFO charge in any given quarter or year will lower the growth and a lower LIFO charge will increase the growth.
 As you look at our guidance for the year, please note that we expect an EPS growth rate in the third quarter similar to what we reported today for the second quarter. We still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the third -- fourth quarter of last year on a 12-week basis. This is because we currently assume a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $41 million credit in the fourth quarter of last year.
 The bottom line of this is we think current estimates for the third quarter are a little low and for the fourth quarter, they're a little high but by offsetting amounts. This is why we continue to be comfortable with the $2.73 to $2.80 per share level for the year.
 We are increasing our identical supermarket sales growth expectations, excluding fuel, to approximately 3% to 3.5% for fiscal 2013. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%.
 And now I'll turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. I'm really proud of what we are accomplishing. We're growing in such a consistent way that it may seem deceptively simple. But the truth is that our hard work over the past 10 years since we began our Customer 1st journey has created a platform for sustainable growth. We are improving our connection with customers and associates, creating new jobs and strengthening job security and rewarding shareholders with consistent earnings per share and dividend growth.
 Now we are happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So guys, 2 things. One, when you look at the 50% share of loyal households, when you talk to those customers and get a sense why they're not spending the other -- a larger piece with you, what do you typically hear from them? And then secondly, I know you want to -- you don't want to give too much detail here, but where do you think there are particular opportunities where you're way under-indexing with those loyal customers in certain product categories? 
W. McMullen: Well, thanks, John. If you look at why they're not shopping with us, it's kind of interesting. When we talk to them, they'll tell us they're actually giving us more business than they give us. And it's really a mixture of 2 things: one, things that they don't put on their Kroger list and they, just for the last several years, just put it on another retailer list; and the other part would be when they're out taking their kids to soccer practice or some other type of event, they'll just stop by and pick up a few items somewhere else. And most times, people will pick up a few extra things. The big opportunities, the easiest way to answer it, there are certain categories where we've significantly improved what we offer from a variety and a price standpoint that those customers don't realize that we've changed. And it really is trying to make sure the customers realize the improvements that we've made, would be the biggest opportunities that I could answer your question without giving a tremendous amount of detail. Obviously, there's a lot of detail behind that statement. 
John Heinbockel: But it's safe to say that the things that they might think of first in another retailer, whether it be paper, cleaning, HBA, I would think those are all areas where you probably under-indexed as opposed to food. Correct? 
W. McMullen: That would be correct. Anything that's not food-related, we would probably under-index on. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then secondly, because I know you guys like to kind of peer around the corner a little bit, what's the current take? Because I know you've been a little bit skeptical about the whole food e-commerce channel. Do you think that will ultimately be, maybe not 2 years from now but 5 or 10 years, something people will -- it'll be more mainstream and something you want to start noodling around with? And if so, do you still think it would be more store-level pickup, a better option for the consumer, ultimately, than home delivery, as you think about it? 
W. McMullen: Well, we continue to experiment with it, as you know, in Denver, Colorado, we have for the last several years. We have a few customers that are very loyal to it, but it's modestly growing and it has modestly grown for a long period of time. We think, over time, it'll just be one part of the way a customer shops, along with physical assets too. So we don't think it's "in place of," we think it's "part of." And we're really focused on trying to deliver something along those lines. One of the things -- we're looking forward to merging with Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter has a pickup model in a lot of their stores. We don't have too much -- we have a little bit of insight, but it's very little at this point until we merge, because obviously, in some markets, we're in the same markets together. So you don't have the complete understanding of how successful it is, but we want to make sure we understand that and what pieces of that make sense to use in other places. 
David Dillon: And John, I would add that we're thrilled in the meantime at the development of the whole digital world and how our customers are engaging with us. Everything from the Kroger app to the online work we do, to the downloading of digital coupons, has all been very successful for us. 
W. McMullen: Yes. It's kind of exciting, but if you look at our digital app now, it's one of the top 2% -- it's in the top 2% of downloads off of -- from Apple. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. 
Scott Mushkin: I had a kind of housekeeping one to start off with. I know you gave us the 4-quarter rolling on fuel. Did you have it for just this quarter on fuel penny profit? 
W. McMullen: It was higher than the rolling 4 quarters. Go ahead and ask your second question and I'll get -- I don't have that exact number in front of me, but we'll get it. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. And then kind of along what John was asking, but maybe asking it a little bit different way, it's a more strategic question. Kroger's probably been the biggest share gainer in the industry for a long time, I think partly because you've just driven the price gaps down with Walmart and then also widened them with some of your conventional guise. But you also did a huge amount on service and perishables and merchandising. But I guess the question is, going forward, how do you envision share gains? Can you -- do you think you can keep up the same pace? And what's going to be the biggest mechanism to drive it? 
David Dillon: Well, it's -- as I mentioned in my own comments, we see this as a sustainable model that continues to build on itself. And I think the most important fact that demonstrates that we believe this can continue for a very long time is the fact that roughly half of the business our best customers can give us, they are giving someplace else. And Rodney addressed that in his comments earlier. I think that's the best evidence. Now there's plenty of other evidence, too. Just the fact that we have 39 quarters in a row of positive identical sales illustrates that there's -- continues to be room to grow. And so we think that the future is still bright and that we see very good opportunity to grow our market share ahead. 
W. McMullen: Hey, Scott, [indiscernible] in the quarter was $0.17 versus $0.164 last year. So while higher, the spread was about the same. So the profit margin per gallon in the quarter was 6/10 higher and the rolling fourth quarter was 4/10 higher. So the incremental was not that significantly different, even though the absolute number was higher. 
Scott Mushkin: I appreciate that. And then my last question goes to kind of the current environment. Are you seeing anything different out there as far as your current trends go? But also, I wanted to talk about, there has been a lot of talk of some changes to the food stamp program. Some of those are just going to happen and then maybe there's going to be some further adjustments as we go forward into the fall. So both current environment and then how you're thinking about the current environment, vis-à-vis some of these changes that may roll through the food stamp program. 
David Dillon: I'm not sure I followed the first part of your question about current trends. You're just talking about generally in the economy? 
Scott Mushkin: Yes, generally in the economy and your -- I guess your trends. I mean, are you seeing anything different out of the consumer that you've been -- that lifts your comps that you've produced this quarter? And then as we go forward, how are you thinking of your business, particularly on the sales line, with the pending cuts? 
David Dillon: Well, first, as you saw, we moved the lower end of our sales guidance up, which should tell you that we are reasonably confident in what the second half of this year looks like. Sales so far, we have 3.5 weeks in this quarter. And while that's hard to predict, it's a whole quarter from that. But they are slightly ahead of where we were for the second quarter. So we're good -- we're comfortable with that picture. Rodney described the economy. The way we're thinking about it is it's still quite fragile but continues to improve and those signs of improvement are many. So there's lots of categories and items and areas that you would say are more kind of discretionary items that people are buying more of today than they were before. And the growth in areas like apparel and cosmetics and toys and greeting cards, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas, natural food, Boar's Head, cheese, prepared meals, all of those are doing really well and growing at good pace. Food stamps are still at a reasonably high level. They did kind of plateau for a while. And you could argue right now, in the last few weeks, anyway, that there's been a slight softening, but it's still at a very high level. And so I wouldn't read too much into that. Your question about food stamps is what happens if those get cut substantially. And I know there's lots of conversations in the Congress on that topic. We, of course, don't know how Congress comes out on that. We don't know how the states will come out on that. We do know that there's a reasonably high demand for food stamps. But remember that food stamp customers also spend some of their own cash on food. That's not their only source to pay for food with us. And while we have a lot of households that use food stamps, just the fact that we've seen some little softening in these last few weeks and yet the sales through the 3.5 weeks I've just mentioned is a little stronger than last quarter, that's a good sign, too. That even in a case where food stamps might get a little softer, we still think we can do quite well in sales. Rodney, do you want to add anything to that? 
W. McMullen: No, I mean, it's something that we certainly look at and we work every day trying to make sure that we give all customers a better value for their money. And if you look at our digital app and everything that we're doing, we're trying to make sure that we continue to take costs out of the business so we can give the customers a better value for their money. So hopefully, the customer that's on food stamps would be able to take advantage of many of those opportunities as well. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup. 
Deborah Weinswig: So if you look back to the beginning of the year when you had a 2.5% to 3.5% projection and now raising the bottom end of that to 3% to 3.5%, what have been the biggest differences in terms of -- whether it be consumer behavior but just in terms of increasing confidence, et cetera? 
David Dillon: Actually, the -- I think the answer is a silly answer, but it's a 6 months passage of time, that before we were looking at a whole 4 quarters, trying to predict where it was going to be, and now we've seen 2 of the quarters and we just have 6 months left in front of us to try to predict. And I think we feel more confident of that. But the factors are the same that I listed with Scott that helped get us to a confident level. 
Deborah Weinswig: Okay. And then in terms of -- if you look at the general merchandise sales that you've seen so far, could you just maybe give us some color in terms of what you've seen in the quarter? And will you also see pockets of opportunity as well? 
David Dillon: Well, we certainly see pockets of opportunity. But in the GM -- I listed several GM categories that I've noted have improved, and GM on the whole has improved. One of the points I made earlier was that all of our departments had positive identical sales and GM did have reasonably good improvement. But it had been, for a long time, it had been more of a laggard. So we're glad to see some improvements there. You want to add anything, Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Well, I was just going to say, it was a little embarrassing, but in terms of the opportunity, I think we're really -- the Fred Meyer team is really having a tremendous amount of success, working deeper with all their divisions across the company and picking up some good new items across the company. We're having very good success on identifying the right items to add in our stores. We're starting to reduce some of our marketplace stores with categories different than what we initially did and very pleased with the success there. You could -- if you looked at it half empty, you would have said, "Well, why didn't that happen 10 years ago?" The half full is, "At least it's happening now." 
Deborah Weinswig: Great. And then last question, obviously, with all the work that you've done with dunnhumby, et cetera, and with the relationship that you have with the customer, can you talk about how aggressive you are in terms of pushing mobile coupons, what you've seen in terms of customer response and just what the opportunity lies ahead? 
W. McMullen: Wait. What? You said coupons, but I couldn't quite, Deborah, hear what you said right before coupons. Did you say mobile coupons? 
Deborah Weinswig: Just in terms of where are you right now in terms of pushing mobile coupons with your relationship that you've had with dunnhumby? And where are you in terms of working with the consumer? And what has been the customer response? 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at -- the usage of digital coupons is significantly higher than the percentage improvement in the download of our apps. We're working with dunnhumby in terms of making sure those coupons are targeted for each customer. And it's -- it's some are at the segment level, some are at the individual customer level. And those would be some of the things that we continually work with and trying to improve. dunnhumby is putting a lot of  resources on R&D today to get better and better at that in terms of targeting overall. And obviously, we're partnering with them to make sure that we continue to improve that. The percentage increases are so big that it really doesn't mean much because it's triple digits, but it's huge triple-digit increases. 
David Dillon: And Deborah, just to illustrate a point, one of my favorite things on our Kroger app when I go to my own list, and I'm starting to make my shopping list and I want to download some coupons, it used to be I would just get a long, long laundry list of coupons that were available to download. And now, they're in the order of priority based on my actual shopping. And that would be true for any of our loyal customers that would have enough of a pattern to give us that. In that way, I don't have to go through 100 coupons to find the 4 or 5 or 6 that I want. And it's a terrific feature as an example. So we keep making improvements. About every 6 weeks or so, we make improvements in the app, which often is focused on the digital coupons and improving that experience. 
W. McMullen: And overall, we communicate with about 9 million households on a regular basis, and all 9 million have unique offers based on their behavior. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Mike, I was hoping you could just provide a little bit of an update on your thoughts around through the timing of issuance related to Harris Teeter, whether that's changed at all given the current market trends? And then, as we think about what you could potentially issue across the curve, you've previously talked about wanting some varied exposure, and given that you just came with 10s and 30s, should we expect more front-end issuance around that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, thanks. Relative to the timing, obviously, their shareholder meeting's October 3 and then we'll still be waiting on final FTC approval after that. So we'll gauge where we are in the FTC process post the shareholder meeting and try to time it relatively close to when the transaction would close so we don't have a lot of negative carry. As we said back when we did the 10s and 30s a couple of months ago, we had several calls during that time and we were very open about the fact that if you wanted 10s and 30s from Kroger, you needed to be in this deal because the next issuance was going to be at the front end of the yield curve. It does 2 things. One, it does what you said, gives us exposure across the yield curve, but it also gives us a better maturity smoothing so that we have some debt coming due every year, so as we need to have the opportunity to pay off some debt to get our ratios at that 2x to 2.2x, we can do that by actually having some debt maturing. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. And just around your desire to maintain some floating rate exposure, how should we think about that? Do you have a targeted percentage or amount that you look at? 
J. Schlotman: Don't necessarily have a set amount. We currently, today, are extremely fixed. We were floating for a lot of this year until we did the bond issuance. In fact, post that bond issuance, you can see in our balance sheet, we have cash invested, which is some of that will go towards financing the Harris Teeter transaction. But I would expect our exposure of floating rates would be either -- it will probably be some combination of commercial paper issuances plus potentially a floating rate note issuance as part of the financing for the Harris Teeter transaction. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Short, Deutsche Bank. 
Karen Short: I just -- I wanted to focus a little bit on inflation and deflation. Looking back the last time when you saw a deflation, it also happened to coincide with a pretty challenging economic and competitive environment. And if I remember, you were investing pretty heavily in price, so selling gross margin was down pretty materially in that particular time frame. I guess looking into 2014, commodity costs appear to be coming down quite a bit and it looks like there is a potential for deflation. So I guess my first question is, what's your outlook for inflation into next year? And then the second question would be, how do you think about pushing the vendors kind of in the face of the potential for deflation and input costs, because I'm assuming you don't really want to be in a deflationary environment in the center stores? 
J. Schlotman: I guess your question on don't want to be in an inflationary environment, I can't do anything to change that, so our job is to make sure we can operate in whatever the environment gives us. At this point, I think there'll still be some slight inflation next year from everything we can see. Don't forget, while there are some -- certainly some commodities that are down, things like meat and some of the other categories continue to have some pressures out there relative to herd size and things like that. Now the chicken complex may come in as the corn crop gets harvested. And if it's as strong as it sounds like, that could help. But when you look at the grocery category, which is, in my mind, the one that's most important, we've actually had more inflation in the first half of this year than we had in the back half of last year. On the back half of last year, grocery inflation was under 1%. It was still inflationary, but slightly. And so far this year, it's north of 1% in the grocery category in both the first and second quarter. So I don't think -- I'm not really overly concerned about actual deflation. There could be less inflation, but that's still prices going up. 
Karen Short: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I guess the second question I had was just ROIC. Obviously, now that your compensation is tied to ROIC, you commented that ROIC might take a hit near term. And I guess the first question is why, because Harris Teeter's ROIC was fairly respectable. But maybe a little color there just on that comment. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't know that the comment said that it was going to take a hit. I said that what we're trying to describe is the fact that -- of the metrics we gave last October, it's going to be the one that takes the longest to have upward momentum on because we are increasing CapEx as we do it. And keep in mind, all the numbers we gave today and our expectations and our predictions and thoughts about the rest of the year are exclusive of Harris Teeter. Once that transaction closes, we'll obviously update our expectations as a combined company. But today, we just can't do that. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky, Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Taking a look at your increased comps guidance, which is great to see, in a generally tamer inflation outlook for the second half of the year than maybe we were talking about on the last call, are you suggesting better volume growth? 
W. McMullen: Certainly -- Chuck, this is Rodney. Certainly, based on what we see today and Dave mentioned earlier, what we're seeing the last 3 weeks or so and a little bit of the last part of the second quarter, we would feel a little bit better volume growth in terms of what our expectations are. 
Charles Cerankosky: What implications does that have for mix? 
W. McMullen: Well, as Dave mentioned, the -- we're having extremely good growth in the perishable departments, in those areas of the store and grocery is improving a little bit. So when you look at mix, we would expect it to probably be more driven by the center of the store than the perishables just because of the way we're starting out. 
Charles Cerankosky: So that would suggest customers doing more of their shopping at your stores? 
W. McMullen: Well, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing good growth in loyal households. And that growth as -- and we have total growth as well. So we would believe we're continuing to pick up a meaningful market share. And it's both in terms of new customers and loyal shoppers spending more with us. 
Charles Cerankosky: We've seen some of the marketplace stores in our travels, including some with the apparel in them. Can you comment on that group of stores? 
W. McMullen: Well, the marketplace is one of our many formats in terms of driving our growth. What we're finding is the Fred Meyer folks are helping us identify the right apparel items to have in. And customers are -- it's one more reason to come to one of our stores. Obviously, it's not typically on your Kroger list. But once you're in the store, you can get a great value for some reasonably trendy apparel at a reasonable price. So, so far, we're pleased. And we continue to add it in our new marketplace stores and as we remodel our marketplace stores. 
Charles Cerankosky: Well, the one in -- maybe it's even open, will the new marketplace in Hilton Head have apparel? 
W. McMullen: That one, I don't know. Mike actually probably knows that one better than me. 
J. Schlotman: You're right, it gives me grief that I'm the construction manager for that project. It's actually not a marketplace store. It's about a 90,000-square-foot supermarket. So it will be a big supermarket, kind of like when you think -- if you've been to our Anderson store here in Cincinnati or the Fort Mitchell store, it'll be more along those lines than a marketplace store. The site just wouldn't accommodate a 123,000-square foot footprint. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Todd Duvick, Wells Fargo Securities. 
Unknown Analyst: Just filling in for Todd here. Most of our questions were answered. But just kind of wanted to circle back financial policy and just more of a confirming question, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So ultimately, I guess, everything kind of flushes through over the next couple of years, you'd like to be at 2x to 2.2x on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, is that correct? 
J. Schlotman: That's always been our long-term target. We typically, over the past several quarters, have been right around 2x. We were just under 2x at the second quarter. And just in anticipation of the Harris Teeter transaction, we were a little conservative from July 8 when we announced that until now on the use of cash to try to pre-lower that ratio a bit, if you will. We're actually a little bit ahead of where we are. And we feel comfortable we're going to be able to execute on all prongs of our financial strategy going forward, including the 2x to 2.2x. We think that's a good proxy for what it takes to maintain a BBB flat credit rating. 
Unknown Analyst: Got you. And markets are hard to gauge a couple of months out and I know you have a meeting coming up. But can you talk to where that ratio would be maybe in '14 in terms of kind of a max or any type of range, how you think... 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't -- I'm not going to speculate on where it will be immediately post the transaction. But if you assume a $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion acquisition price and all that debt goes on day 1, it's going to take a full year to add in any Harris Teeter EBITDA. Though the ratio is going to look pretty high on day 1, but by the end of year 1 and you have all of that EBITDA, if you just assume the EBITDA they've been generating, you'll probably get pretty close to a range of what we would expect by the end of the first full year post the transaction. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling, Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: I know you don't like to give a quarter-by-quarter guidance, but since you did make some references there, is there anything in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about? It looks like, even as you strip out some of the timing shifts, it looks like it embeds a little bit of a change in trend. 
J. Schlotman: I'm not sure what you mean by change in trend. I mean, if you look at purely the swing in LIFO, it's a $0.09 or $0.10 per share effect, just the swing of what last year's LIFO credit was and what this year's was or what this year's is projected to be. So it's a pretty dramatic shift between -- just on that line between the 2 years. If you were to neutralize that, I don't think you would -- I think you would find a quarter that's within our guidance range for the year. We've -- the first couple of quarters have benefited from the opposite of that and that we had a higher LIFO charge last year and a higher LIFO charge -- and a lower LIFO charge this year. If you were to neutralize the first and second quarter LIFO charges, our results actually were nicely at the high end of the range, not a 17% quarter like the headline reads, it's probably an 11% or 12% quarter growth, with LIFO neutralized. And that's why for the year, I mean, if you want to say it's a change in trend for the fourth quarter, mathematically, that's how it would work. But that's just because of the LIFO shift. One of the quarters has to be low when we're at 17%, the first 2 quarters in our guidance is 8% to 11% and it's purely that LIFO in the fourth quarter. It's not a change in the base business. Obviously, with raising the low end of our ID sales expectations, it's not any expectation that the business won't be strong in the fourth quarter. 
Stephen Grambling: Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on, I believe it was Chuck's question. Just fresh produce has been highlighted as -- you highlighted it last year as a big opportunity at the conference. And we've also heard some re-emphasis from Walmart, the high-growth specialty players. Can you just highlight some of the things that you're doing that have been driving the growth there? And then, also, more a long term, as you think about the category, how it might be changing either in terms of pricing, the relevance, et cetera? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look -- as you know, we continue to add organic produce. We continue to work on shortening our supply chain. Our produce team has done a great job on connecting with local suppliers, which significantly increased the amount of local produce that we have, and we're doing a better job telling the customers about it. So it's really all those things together. From a trend, we would expect that to continue into the future. And on produce, we think we're going to be very strong and successful in produce, but we think probably some of the other companies you talked about, I think there's enough growth that all of us will be successful. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jason DeRise, UBS. 
Jason DeRise: It's Jason DeRise. A couple of questions. I wanted to potentially get a little bit more color on the FIFO gross margin x fuel, down 11 basis points, if you can share a bit of the drivers within that. And if that is indicative of the range that you think can be maintained as part of the 8% to 11% growth model long term as opposed to what has been happening in the past now that we've got a couple of quarters in there. And then I just wanted to follow up on the guidance change for sales without EPS. Is it just that the share count and interest view for the year has changed since the beginning of the year when -- or since last quarter when that guidance was updated? 
J. Schlotman: On the gross margin, as Rodney alluded to in his prepared comments, one of the things we've been focusing on, on a rolling 4-quarters basis, is the balance between the leverage of our ID sales, actual cost savings that we achieved and when and how we invest those savings that typically results in lower gross profit. But some of those investments actually wind up increasing OG&A efforts on people via training or something like that, so not everything affects the gross profit. So that gross margin is really dictated on our opportunity to save dollars elsewhere in the organization. The other thing that has helped that and until we cycle some of the bigger ones, clearly, pharmacy gross profit rates are up because generic gross profit rates are higher than non-generic gross profit rates. And that's one of the tailwinds that's in that number which, ultimately, will dissipate. I don't know if that gets to your FIFO gross margin question. 
Jason DeRise: That helps. By any chance, would you want to quantify this quarter what the pharmacy benefit was? 
J. Schlotman: No. 
Jason DeRise: I don't think so. I figured that out. 
J. Schlotman: That was a good -- it was a good driver. And what was your second question? 
Jason DeRise: Just about the reconciling that the sales guidance has come up, but EPS is still the same. 
J. Schlotman: We raised our guidance, EPS guidance in the first quarter, to reflect the results we had in the first quarter. And we continue to post sales essentially just above the midpoint of our current estimate. And anytime you give a range, a company is continually striving to, at their worst, be in the middle of the range and hopefully towards the high end of the range. So it's probably safe to assume that we weren't expecting -- we really didn't want 2.5% sales for the rest of the year to drive the EPS we were giving and really needed sales closer to where we are. And as Dave said, with 7 periods now and the books at 3.3%, for the year to have wound up at 2.5% IDs, that would've inferred a 1.6% ID number in the back half of the year. We just don't see that in the books. We see a number much closer to where we -- we don't see that in the future. Rodney is touching wood by the way. We -- that's our expectation. And I would say it's in the -- both of those are within the range of what we expected when we began the year. 
Jason DeRise: Okay. And I guess the part of the question that maybe I didn't hear on the first part, is it that the share count and the interest outlook is different than when that guidance was issued at the end of Q1? And I guess the Harris Teeter deal, is that sort of the reconciliation there? 
J. Schlotman: The share count and the interest have -- the share count a little bit of effect, but not a dramatic amount of effect on the full year. Interest really not, because for the period of time we were drawn on commercial paper until we termed that out a couple of months ago, we actually were lower on interest during that period of time than we expected. So for the year, we'll probably be a little better on interest than the original expectation. And that will actually help offset some of the lower share repurchases that we're expecting for the year. And I'll reiterate one more time, none of our guidance has any assumptions relative to the effect of Harris Teeter. When that transaction happens, we'll have to reset the bar on what our expectations are. But there's nothing in there relative to Harris Teeter. And one other thing I'll remind you about on those is our guidance for the year would also exclude any transition or transaction expenses related to that. So we'll call those out separately as they occur. We had a little bit in the third -- in the second quarter, but nothing that changed the ultimate answer. And again, we still have the expectation that Harris Teeter will be accretive in the first full year. 
Jason DeRise: Okay. If I can squeeze one more in. With the new stores that you're opening up and I guess some of the remodels that you're doing, how is that progressing at the early stage? Are the stores generating the revenues that you expect? 
J. Schlotman: We're very happy with the early results in the stores we're opening. It's one of the reasons we're keeping our CapEx expectations and spend where we plan to be. And as we said last October, we expect to increase that a couple of hundred million a year. And I would expect, at this point in time, that 2014 would be a couple of hundred million higher than what we have out there as expectations for this year, again, excluding anything relative to Harris Teeter. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Andrew Wolf, BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: I also want to follow up on the gross margin. This year's rate has improved sequentially quite a lot. And you guys signaled at your last investor conference that, I think, the rate of price investments Kroger needed was going to abate, so you'd need less going forward. So I just wanted to ask you straightforwardly, is that the major driver of the improvement in the gross margin rate, less contraction, to be precise, this year so far? I know you've called out other things like generic drugs, but is that one factor, if not the major one, one of the major ones? And what does that imply about the price environment in general? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look, I mean, we obviously have an overall price strategy in terms of our relative price value versus our competition. And we've had that for several years. And we continue to be very aggressively promotionally in terms of giving customers a good value on promotion. I wouldn't overread what this year's number is versus the long-term trend. We're really focused on making sure that we maintain our relative price position. We continue to improve our reputation with our customers. And we balance that with as we take costs out of the business, that we have a slightly improving operating margin. So it's really all 3 of those together. One of the things that's been helpful this year is the pharmacy that Mike mentioned. We're also having good success on reducing some cost of goods on some things that we're doing as well. So that's helping it. The other thing, we probably are investing a little bit more in service this year than a normal typical year. And that's something that, each year, you would balance based on what we see the opportunities in the marketplace. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. And I just wanted to switch gears to labor negotiations. There's been some press reports and I think some Kroger officials have commented as well, that with the coming changes in health care in the system, the Affordable Health Care Act, there have been some changes to contract terms. Does Kroger view that these changes to be Affordable Health Care, coming from the Affordable Health Care Act, as something Kroger can use either to -- well, to reach its goal, which you've stated to have the competitive cost structures, particularly, when you think about the industry having one of the most generous health care benefits in corporate America? 
W. McMullen: Thanks, Andy, for the question. The law really isn't driving -- the changes that you would have read about, the law isn't what's causing those changes. And as you've known Kroger for a long time, we want to make sure our associates and our family have access to affordable health care coverage. And we still are spending about $1.5 billion a year on health care. We would expect that cost to continue to increase even with the changes that you've heard us talk about. Every contract is separate. Every situation is separate. What we find in some cases, our health care plan is so much better -- a lot of spouses will be working. Our health care plan is so much better than a lot of the spouses would have. Spouses are coming to our plan on an increasing rate. And what we're trying to do is to set up where spouses that have coverage, they go to where they have coverage to, in some cases, to take it for that coverage. So overall, we're looking at each contract individually and it's the solution that works fast for that market for that situation. 
Andrew Wolf: Just to follow up, I think in Dave's preamble, he talked about how growth has -- it sounded like it made a more amicable relationship with the unions. So am I understanding that correctly, that maybe the unions are more willing -- and I know each one is a separate entity, but in general, more willing to make certain helpful changes? Because I know Kroger is expanding and adding opportunity for more membership, for example. 
W. McMullen: I guess I would never say that the union has been more helpful. I certainly believe the unions -- we continue to have a partnership to try to work together to figure out what's best for our associates. So I wouldn't say that -- they're not becoming suddenly easy to negotiate with. They're still looking out for their members. But when you look at it overall, one of the things that we're able to bring to the table is a growing company that improves job security. We're creating jobs that have -- and obviously, when you're a department head, you get paid more money than when you're not a department head. And it's those types of opportunities that we're able to provide for our associates. So it's really all those things together that will create a growing company, improves job security and improves what somebody makes on an individual basis because they're getting promoted. 
Operator: Final question will be from the line of Edward Kelly, Credit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: I just had really just a couple of follow-ups, I guess. Mike, a question on generics. The pharmacy margin in general and the contribution from generics, I know you don't want to give the amount. But sequentially versus last quarter, how did the contribution compare? Was it similar, less? 
J. Schlotman: A little less. 
Edward Kelly: A little less. Okay. And could you also give us an update on shrink? I know shrink was something last year that was a little bit of a headwind. I know you guys have been making some progress. Where do you stand on shrink today in terms of your progress and how you feel about that? 
David Dillon: Rodney, you want to comment on that? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Shrink is one of those where -- I don't know that I would ever say I'm ever pleased. We're certainly not satisfied, but we always work -- we're very careful when we are trying to improve our shrink result because it's one of the easiest ways to affect the customer's experience. So we don't want to have low shrink just for the sake of low shrink. We're not as far along as we'd like to be. We're making some progress in some of the areas of the business, but it's one of those things where it's a constant balancing between the pieces. So overall, the answer to your question is we're making progress in some areas. We're still not where we want to be, but we're making sure we do it on a balanced basis. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then just a final question for you. I know you guys recently announced the Harris Teeter deal. What's the M&A environment generally look like today? Are you seeing more opportunity, less opportunity? Just curious as to your general view on what's available. 
David Dillon: Ed, I'll give you a general comment and Mike may want to add more specifics if he wants. But I think we see the environment pretty much like we've been seeing it, that there's lots of things we look at regularly, but very few of them actually fit things that we think are worth doing and worth spending the money on and investing our time. And obviously, we've described Harris Teeter as one of those companies to merge with them. We've admired them for a long time and it's a kind of asset that really helps us grow into a new market. Do you want to add anything else to the environment? 
J. Schlotman: No. 
David Dillon: Okay. So we're going to wrap up and I had just a couple of comments... 
J. Schlotman: I just wanted -- Paul Heldman was nice enough to point to me in my prepared remarks on, I said corporate brand units were up, market share was 24.5%. It's actually 25.4%. I transposed. I just wanted to correct that before we got off the call. Sorry, Dave. 
David Dillon: Well, that's good for the record to get that in there. Thank you.
 So before we end the call, though, as we often do, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who we encourage to listen in on this call. October is Breast Cancer Awareness month across our company. Associates in the offices and the supermarkets and convenience stores and our plants, distribution centers, participate in many activities to honor and pay tribute to those who are fighting this disease. Including many local Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer events. I'm always moved by the outpouring of support and generosity that I see from our associates at events like these.
 In the next few weeks, we'll also begin our annual Giving Hope A Hand campaign to support the fight against breast cancer in our stores. This year, we'll be featuring associates like Lori [ph], an apparel manager at one of our Fred Meyer stores in Oregon, who says, "Losing this battle is never an option."
 Lori and 20 other courageous women will share their stories of hope and courage on specially marked packages of our corporate brands and national brand products. These items will be sold exclusively in our stores from September 22 through October 5. And I encourage you to read our coworkers' inspiring stories at sharingcourage.com.
 Well, that completes our call today. We want to thank everyone for joining us. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2014 Q1  (2013-06-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2013 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Colby, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Colby. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
 We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2013 investor conference to be held in New York in October. We will provide details later this year and look forward to seeing many of you then. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 The year is off to a great start. In the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share. In our investor conference last October, we outlined our long-term strategy and strategic and capital investment plans, which included expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate. 
 Based upon these plans, our positive identical store sales growth for the last 9 years plus, and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and 2012, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance to 8% to 11% plus an increasing dividend. These first quarter results give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering...
 [Technical Difficulty]
 I'm sure we're live. Are we back on? We must be. Okay, so let me continue. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis. I am very proud of our associates for delivering another quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We're connecting with our customers better than ever before, and their positive view of Kroger continues to improve. 
 Our associates also did an outstanding job of keeping costs down this quarter. We continue to find our cost savings in places that do not negatively impact our customer shopping experience so that we can reinvest those savings in ways that create lasting customer loyalty. As a result of this cycle, we achieved our 38th consecutive quarter of positive identical store sales growth. Our solid operating performance continues to support our plans to increase capital investment to grow our business over time. 
 We continue to monitor how 4 factors are affecting consumer confidence: the overall state of the economy, fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty. While there are signs of a better economy, the improvement is not robust. Customer sentiment is gradually improving but remains fragile. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks. 
 Overall, we are confident that we will meet the targets we committed to in October, both now and in the future. We've raised our fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance to reflect this confidence. 
 Rodney will now provide additional details about our first quarter business performance. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on our long-term growth strategy. We continue to narrow our focus on new markets for future expansion and to add square footage in several fill-in markets. 
 Fort Wayne, Indiana is a good example of where we've done this successfully. Over the last several years, we've upgraded our position in the market by investing in new stores and remodels, completing an acquisition and making incremental investments in our people through training and leadership development. As a result, we have doubled our market share in Fort Wayne over the last 5 years. We view this as a successful pilot and are well underway with similar strategies in several other markets. 
 A key growth metric of our business is identical sales because it provides the best measure of our growing relevance with customers over time. We are very pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3.3% without fuel. This is even better when you look at identical sales without fuel and pharmacy. On this basis, our identical sales grew to 4% versus 3.2% on a comparable basis last year. 
 Sales growth in the first quarter was driven by loyal household growth, more visits per household and increases in prices per unit. In addition to visiting our stores more frequently, customers continue to buy more on a monthly basis. Items per basket were slightly up on a per trip basis and a monthly basis. As a result, total units sold was up solidly compared to last year. 
 During the first quarter, we grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. Our loyal household growth count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. 
 The product cost inflation is estimated at 1.7%, excluding fuel. Every store department had inflation, with the exception of seafood, which had deflation. 
 Our pharmacy business has undergone a lot of change in the last 18 months, and we are thrilled with where we are. The amount of Express Scripts volume that we have -- the amount of Express Scripts volume we retained. As expected, the effect of generics continued in the first quarter, which I described earlier, affected identical sales by 70 basis points. Even with these headwinds, our pharmacy team continues to deliver outstanding performance, including solidly positive script count growth. 
 I want to echo Dave's earlier comment that our associates did a great job controlling costs in the first quarter. OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 21 basis points as a percent of sales. 
 Now I'd like to update you on the progress in corporate brand. As we said last quarter, our practice had been to disclose our corporate brand share in the grocery category only. Given the breadth of our corporate brand offerings, we are now comfortable to give you a view of our share across the whole store, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 
 On this broader basis, corporate brands represented approximately 26% of total units sold, up 30 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Total corporate brand sales dollars were 23.7%, also up 30 basis points compared to the same period last year. 
 We continue to see impressive growth in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands. We are regularly adding new items. In fact, we plan to launch 75 new items between now and the end of this year, and today, offer 450 honest, easy and affordable Simple Truth options for our customers. And by the way, they're great. 
 We also continue to make progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operation. Next week, we will publish our seventh Annual Sustainability Report. As a preview, I'd like to highlight some of the -- our most successful initiatives of 2012. 
 We have reduced total store energy usage by 32.7% since the year 2000. We also reduced our carbon footprint and made significant progress toward our goal of 0 waste. 21 of our 37 manufacturing plants have now achieved the impressive goal of sending 0 waste to landfills. I'd like to thank our associates for bringing all these initiatives to life through their individual actions each and every day. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live. 
 Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified a series of new labor agreements, covering stores in Michigan, Houston, Indianapolis, plus Fred Meyer and QFC stores in Oregon. We have many contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Roanoke, Seattle, and later this year in Cincinnati and Dallas. 
 Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. 
 Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective. Growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.
 Now Mike will provide more detail on Kroger's first quarter financial results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.4% to $30 billion in the first quarter compared with $29.1 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.8% in the first quarter over the same period last year. 
 Net earnings for the first quarter totaled $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share. Net earnings for the first quarter of last year were $439 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Several factors contributed to this great result, including strong operations, lower LIFO expense, lower share count and partially offset by our higher effective tax rate this year. 
 FIFO gross margin was 20.65% of sales for the first quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 15 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $17 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $46 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. 
 We were pleased to deliver on our goal to grow FIFO operating margin in the first quarter. First quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $47 million over the prior year. Excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012, on a rolling 4 quarters basis, FIFO operating margin increased 11 basis points. 
 On a rolling 4 quarter 52-week basis, return on invested capital was 13.5% compared to 13.4% during the same period last year. We are committed to growing our ROIC over time, even with the higher level of capital spending. 
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers margin per gallon was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.121 in the same quarter last year. As it relates to retails per gallon in all fuel outlets, they averaged $3.52 in this quarter compared to $3.65 last year. Total gallons sold showed solid growth. 
 Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: Maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments. You will notice on our balance sheet that the current portion of long-term debt has increased, and our net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.85. 
 As it relates to the current portion of long-term debt, we made the conscious decision to fund out our first quarter maturities using the historically low interest rates available in the commercial paper market. Since we have hedged the expected financings, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates has been mitigated. 
 The lower-than-expected net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was primarily a result of our stock's recent performance, which took us out of the market for share repurchases based on the 10b5-1 we had [ph]  in place at the time. As you know, we modify our grid from time to time. We currently have $447 million remaining on our board authorization and believe that repurchases in the current range are attractive. 
 During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 4.5 million common shares for a total investment of $146 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. 
 Capital investment totaled $646 million for the first quarter compared to $557 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full-year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range. 
 Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. Based on the first quarter results, we increased our net earnings guidance range to $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. Our original guidance was $2.71 to $2.79 per diluted share. The company's long-term growth rate guidance is 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time. 
 The calculation of our growth rate for fiscal 2013 is based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, as was shown in Table 6 of the fourth quarter press release. Adjustments include the UFCW consolidated pension plan lability, the credit card settlement and the extra week. 
 As you look at our expectations for the year, please keep in mind the guidance we gave in March for the fourth quarter. On a 12-week basis, we still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the fourth quarter last year. This is because we currently expect a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter this year compared to a credit of $41 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Kroger continues to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal year 2013. 
 Now I will turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Mike. I understand that at the beginning of the call, several of you were not able to hear our opening comments. And so I know that a lot of the purpose of this call is to give you a sense of how we felt about the quarter. So I'm going to go back and repeat just a little bit of what I think you may have missed. 
 The most important part you missed was the stunning oratory that Cindy offered of the forward-looking statement caution. But that, rather than read that you, I just want to you know that is posted online so you can find that there. 
 But the other paragraph that you missed was my initial comments about how I felt about the quarter, and so I want to read those to you, they're important. I said that this year is off to a great start. And in the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share. 
 In our investor conference this last October, we outlined our long-term strategy, our strategic and capital investment plans, which include expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate. Based upon these plans, our positive identical sales growth for more than 9 years and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and '12, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance from 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. 
 These first quarter results that we're here to talk about today give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term earnings guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis. 
 So with that background, before I turn to questions, I want to close with these observations. I'm very proud of the Kroger team's relentless focus on delivering on our Customer 1st strategy quarter after quarter. It's what sets us apart from competition. Our customers' positive view of Kroger continues to improve, and they are rewarding us with their loyalty. 
 We achieved strong sales and record earnings per share for the quarter, controlled costs and delivered on our goal to improve FIFO operating margin. The momentum coming out of the first quarter will continue to drive growth and greater shareholder value. So now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: A couple of things. First, did the first quarter come in a little bit better than you guys had planned in light of sort of the quarterly breakdown Mike had given on the last call? If that's true, what may have driven the upside in your mind? And then I know on the last call, Mike, you'd also -- you'd talked about the second and third quarter being up toward the high end of your long-term range. Are those still about right or has anything changed there? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, the second and third quarter guidance would remain unchanged, and we didn't call that out in the prepared comments. I focused only on the fourth quarter. Just to make sure everybody remembered that's what we said about the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter, yes, it came out a little better than we expected. Sales were a little stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, so I would say it was primarily a sales-driven beat in the first quarter, and just as well was great execution at store level from a cost control standpoint as well. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then secondly, as you think about market share, maybe for Dave and Rodney, when you think about market share, and we give the Fort Wayne example, have you yet had a market, and I'm not sure if it would be Cincinnati or Denver or one of those, a market where you've not been able to increase share, you've hit a natural ceiling. And then when you think about the incremental margin attached to that, does that -- as you get to certain points of share, whether it be 30 or 35 or whatever, does the incremental margin sort of step up, up to a certain point and then flatten out, or how do you think about the economics of that? 
David Dillon: Well, I'm sure there's some point of diminishing returns, but I don't think we found it yet. And I think we're pleased that at any of the historical references we would have to look at market share, we're not going talk about specific markets in that regard, but we have plenty of examples, some of which you've already listed, that illustrate well how that strategy will work. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? 
W. McMullen: The only thing I would add is one of the things that we continue to expand some of the things we offer in a market, too. So if you look at the core grocery business, you may start getting a cap there or a diminishing return. But one of the things that we've had, and we've had very good results that help our return on investment, is expanding some of the things we're offering. So in some of the markets that you gave examples of, if you look at our marketplace store, we're finding we are getting good returns by expanding what we offer to the customer. 
David Dillon: That's a really good point because it is a dynamic marketplace, and things will change over time, and even when you think you've hit a peak, you just push yourself to find additional either products or services or remodel the stores or approach the stores differently. It's just a dynamic place. 
W. McMullen: And we do -- every time we do an investment project, we look at the incremental effect that it has on surrounding stores to make sure that their incremental return is there. And so it becomes store specific on each individual investment decision. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. But I guess you haven't hit a peak yet in share as far as you can tell in any market, right? 
W. McMullen: Not that we can tell. 
David Dillon: Yes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I would like to just understand a little bit your sales guidance. You're still maintaining the 2.5% to 3.5%, although you hit close to the high end. And I would have thought that generics would have been a particularly negative impact on the first quarter, probably even through the whole first half, and then I think fuel prices were down a little bit. So are you being just very conservative, or is there something about sales for the next 3 quarters that make you believe that you'll stay no more than this range? 
W. McMullen: It's really just so early in the year, and it's just having 1/4 of the year over with. Obviously, so far, we're very pleased with our sales. We continue to strive to be in the top part of that range. We continue to strive to be there. But I would say the biggest thing is it's just early in the year, and it felt too early to change guidance on that given all the uncertainty that's going on in the marketplace. 
Meredith Adler: Okay, I understand that. I guess, I just would like to ask a little bit about inflation. 1.7% is not an excessively moderate number. I don't know what the trends have looked like. And a concern often is that if inflation gets to be moderate enough, some retailers could end up with negative comps, and you could see a heightening of the competitive environment. Are you seeing anything like that anywhere, or is there any reason to be concerned about that? 
David Dillon: Meredith, I'll have Mike maybe comment on inflation and then Rodney on the competitive environment. But the inflation we saw in the first quarter was very similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter. And while there's a little push and take in what department it fell in, it was very similar and quite moderate. So you want to comment on where you see inflation, anything else you want to add, Mike? 
J. Schlotman: No, I think inflation in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be, and it's essentially in line with what we baked in to our expectations for the year. 
W. McMullen: And certainly from a competitive standpoint, we don't see huge changes. As you know, we always try to make sure we stay flexible to deal with competitive changes as they happen. But so far, we haven't seen really any change going on. 
Meredith Adler: Okay, that's great. I guess my just one other question would be about your investments in new stores in maybe new markets or adjacent markets. Is there anything in terms of what's happening with competitors or the real estate market that make you feel better or worse about the ability to generate a good return from those new investments? 
David Dillon: I think the decision more rides upon our confidence in what we're doing. And I think it's somewhat independent. I mean, I suppose there's some outside factors that could cause you to go a different direction. But more than anything, it's really focused on what we do well and what we have confidence that we can continue to do well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Krueger. 
Edward Kelly: I'm with Crédit Suisse. Dave, could you discuss the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in Q2 and how underlying -- I guess, underlying volume is probably the same since inflation is the same, but could you just give a little bit color there? 
David Dillon: Sure. I'll describe what I think I recall and Beth will correct me if I'm wrong because she's sitting here with me. But earlier in the quarter, let's say through the first half or even 2/3 of the way through the quarter was a little stronger than at the tail end of the quarter. But we still ended up happy and strong at the end of the quarter. And then so far, after 3.5 weeks, we've seen IDs without fuel to be very similar to what they were in the first quarter. 
W. McMullen: The other thing worth mentioning is just Easter. 
David Dillon: Yes, that's true. 
W. McMullen: The comment early in the quarter is certainly true. Then when you look midway through the quarter, it's a little harder to see because Easter was earlier this year than last year. So some of the cycling of the change in Easter also affected the cadence during the quarter. 
David Dillon: Yes, I think we -- I'd tell you the same caution I tell ourselves is don't try to overread it because -- the first quarter in particular, because of that Easter phenomenon. Every year, we're in this no man's land of trying to read, are you happy or not happy with your sales? And the week before Easter, the week after Easter and a few of the days surrounding either direction of that have a big impact on how you're going to feel. So I wouldn't overread it. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. My next question for you is on the gross margin. Historically, there seems, like our perception at least into the markets, is there has been more volatility in your gross margin quarter-to-quarter. Whereas you may see an opportunity to make an investment, it's probably hurt sort of investor perception of the company historically. But more recently, it felt a little bit more consistent. And I guess the question really is, has there been any change in the way you sort of think about running the company in terms of the investments that you're making in margin and the volatility around that in terms of you trying to take advantage of different opportunities? 
David Dillon: Well, I think you're well aware that we try to look at this on an annual basis. However, we have also tried to be a little more consistent and conscious of the way in which a quarter might appear, so that we don't end up doing something abrupt in 1 quarter and wishing we hadn't done that, and then the next quarter have to go the other direction. So we have been a little bit more careful ourselves. We also have learned a little bit better how to pace ourselves on those kinds of investments, so that's helped. Rodney, you may want to comment a little bit on just how you see gross generally in the quarter. 
W. McMullen: Yes, I would agree with the comments Dave made. One of the things that, over the last several years, we've worked really hard to make sure that we understand what cost reductions we're getting and trying to make sure that we manage our gross investments, tying in and getting costs out. I would say that probably our internal estimation systems, we feel they're of a little higher quality in terms of giving us really better estimates in terms of what we're seeing on taking costs out because of our operations team and our finance team working together, which then, in turn, makes it a little easier to balance that with selling gross changes too. 
David Dillon: Now one thing you ought to recognize, too, is that the moderation you saw in the first quarter was at least, in part, helped by the gross margin in pharmacy. Rodney commented on that in his prepared remarks, that pharmacy, because of the change to generics, has -- the sales dollars are down, our script count is terrific, but the effect on gross, it tends to flip it a little bit because the gross margin has been improved. Rodney you want to comment... 
W. McMullen: Well, yes, I was just going to say the change in pharmacy made a huge effect in the total numbers. So if you look at the individual pieces, it would have actually been a little more than what it appears on the total. 
David Dillon: And I thought that's important for you to know, but that was still on a very planned basis. I mean, we knew exactly where pharmacy was headed, and I could see that completely coming. So it wasn't a surprise to us at all. 
Edward Kelly: And one very quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, is your SG&A comparison in the second quarter as difficult as it looks? Dollars weren't -- not up much last year. Should we consider that in the model? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think it's something you should be overly concerned with. I can't think of anything that we're facing right now as compared to the prior year. And it's -- our expectations for the quarter are certainly baked into our guidance. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: A few quarters ago, you had such, I guess, intense promotional spending from your vendors who sell branded food that your share of private label actually went down temporarily. I'm curious, I guess, if you can update us on the promotional dynamic today among your branded vendors in general. And the reason I'm asking is we're seeing some data today from Nielsen that would suggest maybe a broader number of grocery items sold on promotion today, but we're not seeing either way how deep some of those discounts are. So I guess I'm just curious for any color on the promotional dynamic overall among your grocery vendors. 
David Dillon: I'll see if Rodney wants to give you specifics, but before he does, I would just say the keyword you used was dynamic. And you should think of this as changing all the time, I mean, every month, every quarter. So I don't know that we're going to be able to identify a clear pattern for you. But Rodney, you have any comments on that? 
W. McMullen: I mean, if you just look at over a long period of time, private label or corporate brands have continued to gain share. Usually, what happens is some CPGs will make more money than they should be because the raw material costs haven't increased. And that always provides a huge umbrella for corporate brands to gain share, which happens. Then, the CPGs will get a little more aggressive with promotional dollars, which will bring it back down. But what we find is very seldom does the share ever go back to where it was before. There is a permanent loss when CPGs do that. So it is, as Dave mentioned, it's a dynamic process, but we -- overall, we think that's one of the really important reasons and critical for us to have such a strong corporate brand program that connects with customers. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: Could you guys just talk about, I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on rates. If rates -- and I guess, Mike, you could -- maybe you can answer this. If rates back up another 50 or 100 basis points, what's going to be the overall impact on your expenses, say, over the next year or 2? Will that actually be a net positive since it could take certain expenses, such as pensions, down a little bit? 
J. Schlotman: It'll have some marginal effect on the funded status of my corporate plan. Keep in mind that all the UFCW funds that we participate in actually present value their lability at the expected rate of return, not current interest rate, so it really won't have any affect on my UFCW funded status. And the contributions to those funds are dictated by a contractual obligation anyway, not necessarily an exact funded status. So I don't really see any effect on my operating expenses as it relates to the backup in rates. Even the -- it's interesting to talk about a 2.4% 10-year treasury or so as the backup in rates because it's still a historically low treasury rate. And even if I had to refinance the debt I have coming due at these rates, I still wind up leveraging down the weighted average cost of my debt portfolio. So I'm still comfortable we're going to be able to execute the financial strategy we have. Plus, as I said earlier in my prepared comments, we've actually been utilizing the -- our commercial paper availability rather than accessing the market because we've been able to borrow at such low rates. And it helped the first quarter probably by $0.005. So I don't really see a huge positive or negative at this point from where rates are. 
Shane Higgins: And just a question on the fuel rewards program. Have you guys made any significant changes to the fuel rewards promotions, particularly as more and more competitors roll out these similar programs? 
W. McMullen: We would continually offer different promotions on fuel rewards, things like that. But it -- it's one of the nice things about being first in the market. It continues to connect extremely well with our customers and especially our oil customers. But there's always different offers that you'll do in a specific market from time to time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Dave, I think I've asked you this before, but when you mentioned the variability of sales, not too surprising given some changes in payroll taxes and so on, but has -- or are you trying to tell us the amplitude? Or  has that gotten worse, better or stayed the same? 
David Dillon: I'd say it's about like it had been, that in short-term periods for like a day or a week, often unpredictable, but there's a reasonably clear pattern we've seen once you extend the time period to go to a period or a quarter. So yes, I'd say it's pretty much like what we've been seeing. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: The only thing that I would add and this is if you look at electronic benefit transfers, states continue to change the days that the dollars go out on benefits, which also causes some of the variability. And you don't know how much of that variability is just because of that change or how much of it is broader than just that change. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. So obviously, when it's smoothed out over a quarter or what have you, things are fine. Your IDs are excellent. But how about operationally? I mean, are you trying to say it's harder to set store hours because it's harder to predict who's coming in what day? 
W. McMullen: It certainly is harder to make sure you stay in stock. And I think our teams are doing a great job doing that, but it does -- any type of variability obviously makes it a little more complicated to manage against. 
Andrew Wolf: And I also wanted to follow up just on the guidance. You were above your internal expectations and then raised guidance a little bit. So is that -- I just want to underline this or ask you to underline this. Is that more what you're seeing out there either with the consumer or with pricing and competition? Or is it -- it just it -- is it just it's early yet and you just don't want to raise guidance more than you might want -- at this juncture raise guidance more than you did? 
J. Schlotman: No, I think we're comfortable with the guidance we gave and it's where we believe we'll wind up on the year. Obviously, we raised the low end a little more than the high end, and that's because of the strength of the first quarter. We think that the low, the potential low end will be better than we originally thought. And I do want to remind folks that the fourth quarter, we do, as we sit here today, on a 12-week, 12-week basis, expect that to be behind because of the LIFO swing. And that's in our numbers, but not necessarily in everybody else's numbers. 
Andrew Wolf: Fair enough. And I understand about the guidance. I guess your guidance is your guidance. But I guess I'm trying to say is -- was there any change during the quarter or now, competitively or with the consumer, that has changed your thinking on the year? 
J. Schlotman: I think relative to what we see for the rest of the year, we remain committed to what our original guidance was. And we tried to compare to our original expectations. And we flowed that through our annual expectations, and we're comfortable what we -- with what we see from our original expectations for the rest of the year. 
Andrew Wolf: And this is probably for Rodney. Rodney, in the past, when you -- people ask you about M&A, you said a lot of the chains don't pencil out because their pricing in the market's too high. Now as I think about the portfolio of banners at Kroger, you actually run some high end and low end, such as Food 4 Less and Quality Foods, one which goes at a discount versus conventionals, one that goes at a premium. So how do you view -- when things come up in the marketplace that are either discount or premium type banners that are for sale, how do you view looking at their relative pricing? Do you still want it to be in line with the market, which you would, I guess, for typical conventional? Or do you adjust that thinking for the type of banner that you're -- that is out there in the marketplace? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't give any insight into how we actually analyze any opportunity that comes up. We -- as we've said historically, we look at a lot of things when they come up, act on a very little of that, and actually, when I say act, make an offer on very little of that, and have a deal come to fruition even on less assets than that. If you look at our pattern over the last several years, we continue to be very happy with the fill-in acquisitions we've done. But to give specifics on how we might look at a particular group of stores, I just don't see any upside in going down that path. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with Merrill Lynch. 
Kelly Bania: Just curious on private label now. You mentioned some changes into how you're measuring the units and the dollars in that category. Can you remind us or let us know what categories are now in there? And then I guess related to that, how do you think about the Simple Truth line and shelf space there? I guess what I'm wondering, is there opportunity to add more? It sounds like it still continues to go very well. 
W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the private label share that I outlined, it includes all the departments except for fuel and pharmacy, so it would include produce, meat, seafood, drug/GM, plus the grocery categories that we've always done in the past. So it's the complete store excluding pharmacy and fuel. Those things we thought would be a little complicated because we're not -- the generic drugs, do you put it as private label or not, and then obviously, fuel, we sell all our fuel unbranded. So that's what's included in the market share and the unit share that I talked about. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit in terms of if you look at shelf space, the model that we use to determine whether an item gets on the shelf is exactly the same for our corporate brands as it is for national brands, because we don't want -- we want to make sure, from a customer standpoint, the same dynamic is driving the location on a shelf and the item itself, whether it even gets on the shelf. The accountability for that has to be the same for our corporate brands just like a national brand. In terms of Simple Truth, it's been obviously a huge home run. It's connected really well with our customers. Because of that, it -- the brand itself is earning more shelf space, and we continue to find new items that will fit nicely into that Free From 101 different ingredients and Simple Truth Organic. So it's working really well, but it's earning its way there because of the connection with our customer. 
Kelly Bania: Great, that's very helpful. And then if I could just follow up with one more question on gas. It looks like your gas margin came in a little bit lower for the quarter year-over-year, and I'm just wondering if you can remind us how you're planning that segment for the year in terms of profitability. And then just remind us, you mentioned that half of your stores, roughly half your stores have the gas offering. Is there much trend -- difference in trend in traffic or IDs right now, particularly with gas prices a little bit lower right now year-over-year? 
David Dillon: Mike, you want to address that? 
J. Schlotman: Well, when you look at fuel, any one quarter can be somewhat volatile on fuel margins in retails, which is why we talked about that. Relative to what we saw in the first quarter compared to our expectations for the year, I would say the first quarter wasn't that far out of the ballpark when you look at the comparisons of the numbers that we talked about at the supermarkets. They weren't wildly different, and it's clearly something that, as I said, we expect fuel to be a contributor to the overall growth of the company. Fuel earned a little bit less in the first quarter than it earned last year in the first quarter, but we experience that from time to time, and my guess is there'll be a period of time this year where it earns more from year-to-year. Relative to the -- why we put them at the fuels -- at our supermarkets essentially, it's just one more thing that we can solve a convenience for and offer a value to the customer, where, when they're already at our store and they come to -- our most loyal customers come to our stores 2, 3 or 4 times a week, and they have the availability of fuel there along with the fuel rewards, it's an incremental reason for them to want to come to Kroger versus a competitor. And it's clearly part of the overall value proposition our customers see. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS. 
Jason DeRise: Sorry, if there's background noise here. I'm on the road, and once I ask it, I'll mute. Could you quantify the gross margin impact from the pharmacy? Could you also talk about the impact on gross margins from ending the double couponing in many of your banners? And then actually the follow-up to the last question, if you could actually quantify the difference in same-store sales for your stores with and without fuel stations? 
W. McMullen: In terms of the gross margin effect from pharmacy, I won't break it out separately. It was a meaningful number, but I won't break it out separately. On double coupons, we invested the monies that were saved from double coupons into lower everyday pricing. So if you look in total, it actually had no effect on gross margin. Because what we found was there wasn't very many customers actually engaged with double coupons, and we felt like it was better to give lower prices to all customers, so all customers could get the benefit of that. So it really didn't affect much. And then identical sales with and without fuel locations, that, obviously for competitive reasons, we have not shared and wouldn't think it's appropriate to share at this point either. 
Jason DeRise: On the gross margin for the pharmacy, the impact, if I put out a number, will you say if that makes sense or not? Kind of in the 20- to 30-basis-point range as a positive in that result? 
W. McMullen: I won't. I don't know whether, Dave or Mike, if there's any insights that you can help -- that you would think Jason could find helpful. 
David Dillon: No, I don't think there's anything else to add other than I don't think you would find the quarter and the variations and stuff to be unusual. The only thing that was unusual here is, and you can see with the 15-basis-point investment in our gross margin, that that's a little smaller than where we ran in any of the quarters last year. And we've just identified that the reason it was as moderate as it was, was, in large part, because it was helped from the pharmacy. Now we knew that going in and had that expectation. So, it was part of a planned program, but that's about as far as I think we're going to be able to go. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more color around how we should think about your long-term debt market needs for the duration of this year. We appreciate the commentary around your shift to CP usage. Should we expect that to continue or is there a potential need for you to come back into the long-term debt markets this year? 
J. Schlotman: At some point in time this year, we will access the fixed income markets and term out some of the debt. We just made the strategic decision early on in the year because we have plenty of capacity on our revolver. Our exposure to floating rates over the last several years has actually been relatively modest. So to try to adjust for that, we've termed out in the short -- in the short run on work -- on our commercial -- well, it's the commercial paper that we issued backstopped by our bank revolver. The -- if you look at that trend since then, the balance of that has come in some, because this is really the point in time of the year where we generate a lot of cash flow. And that also gave us the comfort to have it out there on the commercial paper markets. When we think about issuing it at, let's say, between 40 and 45 basis points on a regular basis, as compared even to historically low rates...
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Sorry, can you hear us? 
J. Schlotman: We can now. Somehow, we lost the connection. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Okay. I think you got cut off right after you talked about issuing on a regular basis at about 40 to 45 basis points. 
J. Schlotman: Okay. I appreciate you telling me how much of my wonderful answer I gave. See if I can repeat it now. So Cindy will look at the transcript to see how close the 2 of them compare. But we've been very successful with being able to issue that debt, as I said, in the 40- to 45-basis-point range. The fact of the matter is this part of the year is when we generate a lot of free cash flow. So we felt taking a little bit of risk of terming that -- putting that out on a working capital line made sense. We don't have, historically, a lot of floating rate exposure, and it was really an attempt to gain a little bit more exposure to floating rates. The amount of commercial paper we have outstanding has come in since then. But as you may or may not have heard me say, we do expect at some point this year to term out some of our longer-term debt needs. 
Priya Ohri-Gupta: Do you have any sense or could you give us any guidance on potential size or part of the curve that you might look at? 
J. Schlotman: I don't want to give too much insight to it. You can look at our 10-Q or 10-K, and you can see how many dollars we've had hedged to give you some insight to what we think we -- our expectations and needs may be. But as far as the exact amount and what duration those may be, we'll wait and see what the markets are like when we actually access the markets. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Citi. 
Tiffany Kanaga: Can we get an update on how online retail and home delivery is going at King Soopers? And are there any thoughts around expanding it to other markets? 
W. McMullen: As you know, we've been experimenting with Denver for several years. It continues to grow at a modest rate. We're working on it as much in terms of understanding the economics and trying to get a model that actually is profitable. So it's one of those things where you should see us continue to work on it to improve it. We've actually changed our team -- our complete digital team, in terms of bringing some high talent from the outside to help us accelerate our growth. We feel very good about where we are headed. And as you know, from a digital standpoint, it's broader than just what you sell online. We also are very aggressive on making sure we use our strength and insights we already have on our digital strategy, based on customer needs. We're having huge growth in terms of the use of our website, the use and download of our apps, and we're also partnering with dunnhumby to improve those from a relevancy standpoint. So we actually are looking at digital much broader than just what you sell online, and we're making huge progress in terms of connecting with the customer digitally, and partnering with dunnhumby to do that in a way that uses our strengths and insights. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. 
Joseph Feldman: Wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question. Just with the recent launch of like AmazonFresh and there's more talk of delivery and e-commerce shopping for groceries, and I was just wondering if you could provide us with kind of your latest updates and thoughts on, I guess, e-commerce strategies or digital strategies within the grocery business. 
W. McMullen: The -- I'll give a little bit -- just in terms of -- tied in and talked -- some of the comments I just made to Tiffany. As you know, we've had, where we deliver in Denver, for several years and -- a website where we sell through. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we continue to work on how to get that to scale and profitability. But we think it's important to look at it more than just what you sell on the web and how do you connect with a customer on an overall digital basis, and making sure we use some of the strengths and insights we have. We're having huge growth with people downloading our apps, using our apps on almost a daily type basis. And we partnered with dunnhumby in terms of making that relevant for each customer, using each customer in terms of setting the prioritization. We feel really good about where we're headed, and it's something we continue to work on and we continue to get better and better at. And selling is just one piece of that connection with the customer digitally. 
Joseph Feldman: Got you. Got you. I mean, do you envision like a store pickup type of program? Or are you testing that anywhere? 
W. McMullen: The -- we would be testing almost everything that you can imagine, but I think, at the end of the day, there will be something that will be a combination of a lot of different pieces together. And we actually think that, that's one of the strengths that will play to us, just because we have so many convenient stores located close to customers' houses that it'll be left up to customer in terms of how they want to engage with us. 
Joseph Feldman: Got it. And then one last one and I apologize for repeating that question, but with -- the Affordable Care Act and how are you guys thinking about that? What kind of impact do you think it might have on you guys and your business, on the labor negotiations that you have? Just any thoughts and more color on that would be helpful. 
David Dillon: Well, it certainly affects, in one way or another, everything you do that touches health care. So in all of our union negotiations, whether it's at the trust fund level or in the negotiations themselves, you have to make sure that the health care plans work their way to complying with and, actually, working together with what the Affordable Health Care Act requires. So we've been going through that process in negotiations, and it certainly adds some degree of tension in the negotiations. But we have a good, really solid working relationship with the locals that we work with, and as you've seen, the contracts get settled over the last, really couple of years. All of those have had some implications from the Affordable Health Care Act. As to the company plan, we have done the same thing within our own organization of making sure that we've worked through understanding those requirements and including them in our own plans. In terms of costs, sure, we think they will go up a little. We're not -- I don't think we've publicly quantified that and nor do we intend to today. But I think it's all been -- so far, been workable, and we've been happy with the way things have worked out so far. Rodney, you want to add anything? 
W. McMullen: No, no. 
Joseph Feldman: Okay. So you -- I mean, I guess maybe deeper into the year, we'll get a better sense of what you're thinking as far as -- I mean, I guess, I'm trying to understand like will there be any kind of an EPS impact. Really, it's more a 2014 thing. And I know you don't want to quantify it today, but just should we expect that maybe at the October meeting or... 
David Dillon: Well, what you should expect is that we took into account what we know about health care costs when we gave you the guidance in March and when we updated the guidance today for this year. And we also have in mind and have a sense of what we see in health care trends when we gave you the long-term guidance of our earnings growth of the 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend. So we're knowledgeable of that when we made those decisions. So to that extent, it's been included in what we've told you. 
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Jason DeRise. 
Jason DeRise: I just thought that -- again, sorry, for the background noise, but I thought the comment about the convenience stores, as they fit into this omni-channel Kroger, was really interesting. And I wanted to get a sense of how far into the future do you think that would be a reality, of the omni-channel Kroger using all the points in online and pickups. I know in the past, it's been said that Kroger is a slow Midwest-moving company, but some of these other retailers are thinking about this more aggressively. So if you can comment on that, that would be great. 
W. McMullen: Well, it's really -- I mean, our strategy is really built around letting the customers decide digitally how they want to connect with us. And we spent a ton of effort and energy making sure that we do an awful lot of research and testing things enough to understand the economics of what we're doing. So it's really taking all the pieces and tying them together. And when -- you should expect to see us, when we find something that makes money, we'll move very aggressively. And until then, you'll see us continuing to test to make sure we're involved and aware, but we don't see a benefit of rolling something out that doesn't create value for our customers and our investors as well. 
Jason DeRise: Hopefully, we hear more about this during the Investor Day. 
David Dillon: And I think that's our last question. Given that we had disruption a couple of times on the call, I thought it would be best to run a little longer and make sure we got all the questions in, and we appreciate all of those. We apologize for the 2 interruptions that we had. And as I usually do, before we end the call today, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. We encourage them to do that.
 First, I want to thank each of the 400 -- or 4,800 leaders around the country who joined us for the first-ever Kroger Leadership Summit in Louisville recently. Because of you, this event was a big success. Taking the next steps in our Customer 1st journey together is important, and we're inspired by the enthusiasm and the passion that you show for leading our associates and serving our customers. We know you will continue to make a difference everyday for our customers and our communities.
 Also this month, we celebrate community service in a special way at Kroger. Through widespread volunteer activities, our associates help strengthen the communities where we live and work. We're pleased to recognize, in our Annual Report, 29 associates across the company for their outstanding service as recipients of Kroger's 2012 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent to feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and coach at-risk teens, among many other causes, and we are grateful for their commitment.
 I want to personally thank all our associates from coast to coast, who volunteer in so many ways. Rodney and I are touched by the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others in all the places around America that we call home. That completes our call today. We thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2013 Q4  (2013-03-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2012 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kirstie, and I'll be your operator for this -- for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Kirstie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com.
 After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 Kroger had an outstanding fourth quarter and an outstanding year. We accomplished a lot in fiscal 2012. We delivered on ID sales growth, we exceeded expected earnings per share growth, we increased FIFO operating margin and we increased our dividend 30%. Kroger's unique value offering of better service, great products and enjoyable shopping experience and lower prices continues to resonate with a full range of customers. The result is an industry-leading 37 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth. In this morning's press release, we provided you with details to make it easier for you to do an apples-to-apples comparison and understand how we look at our business internally. Table 6 in our press release was designed to help you understand the details behind the growth figures we reported.
 We delivered value to shareholders by increasing our dividend and exceeding our own earnings per share guidance through the combination of solid operating results and share buyback. We returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback in 2012. Our associates delivered an outstanding year that underscores Kroger's growing connection with customers remains the key to shareholder value creation. In a moment, Rodney will outline how we got there, and Mike will discuss the numbers.
 First, I'd like to give you some insight into what our customers are facing today. Consumer confidence was fragile throughout the year, and it hit its lowest point this January as customers voiced heightened concern over taxes. We believe 4 factors will continue to affect consumer confidence: the overall state of the economy, fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty. These factors are causing sales comparisons between days and weeks to be highly variable. But overall, we continue to have strong ID sales trends.
 We remain confident in our ability to deliver growth despite the economic uncertainty. Our team has delivered strong results by executing our Customer 1st Strategy over the last 5 years. And as you know, the last 5 years has been highly volatile, and we have continued to consistently deliver through that time. A cornerstone of our Customer 1st Strategy is the value our associates deliver to our customers. Our customers are stressed at the pump, they look to our Fuel Points program for meaningful savings. And when families have less to spend in restaurants, our ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat meals help them eat well at home.
 When you want convenience of finding everything you need plus a little in one place and save time at the checkout, nobody does it better than our family of stores. So whatever the economic and operating environment, Kroger is situated to deliver on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond. Our ability to do this is what makes Kroger a compelling investment.
 Rodney will now provide deeper insight into our business performance and share our year-end market share statistics with you. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We are implementing our long-term growth strategy, which includes: targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging dunnhumby insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program.
 We continue to make good progress, adding square footage in 4 fill-in markets, and we've identified others based on various metrics. We have narrowed the list of new markets for future expansions. In 2013, we plan to build, expand or relocate 45 to 50 supermarkets compared to 44 in fiscal 2012.
 At our Investors Meeting in October, we identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our success. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results of each metric. On identical sales, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3% without fuel. We focus on identical sales because it provides the strongest measure of our relevance with customers over time. Our identical sales without fuel and pharmacy were consistent throughout the year. We are very pleased with our identical sales trends through the year, given the fact that inflation declined during the year and tonnage growth improved throughout the year.
 Consistent with our guidance at the start of 2012, pharmacy sales benefited overall sales in the first half of the year. This was due to strong growth in our pharmacy business, including attracting and retaining Express Scripts business. As also in line with our guidance at the start of the year, identical sales trended down as prescription drugs came off patent. These events will be important to keep in mind as you estimate our quarterly sales expectations for 2013. Mike will provide our guidance shortly.
 Rolling 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 6 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2011 result. This is in line with our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on our rolling 4-quarters basis. The third target metric is return on invested capital, or ROIC. ROIC in the fourth quarter held steady at 13.4%, the same as last year. We are committed to growing our ROIC over time, even with the higher level of capital spending. Our fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money.
 According to Nielsen Homescan data, Kroger's overall dollar share of products we sell in markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points during fiscal 2012. The pace of our market share growth accelerated in the back half of the year. This mirrors our tonnage growth during the year.  This data also indicates that our share increased in 10 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report and declined in 9 areas. Walmart Supercenters, our primary competitor in 17 of the 19 marketing areas, outlined by the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased to 9 of those 17 markets and declined in 8 markets, and overall market share slightly increased. This Nielsen Homescan Data is generated by customers who self-report their grocery purchases to Nielsen. This includes all retail outlets that sell the same products that we sell.
 Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses for our eighth consecutive year. In fiscal 2012, OG&A plus cost plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 48 basis points as a percent of sales. Sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in visits per household, loyal household growth and slight increases in units per basket and per month. As a result, total units sold were up solidly compared to last year as I mentioned before.
 For the full year, customer visits and monthly purchases were up, while items purchased each trip were down. The number of loyal households continued to increase, as did the number of loyal household store visits. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation declined to 1.7% excluding fuel. Once again, every store department had inflation with the exception of seafood, which had deflation.
 Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of grocery department sales dollars in the fourth quarter, and grocery department corporate brands units sold were 33.5%. The mix between national brands and corporate brands fluctuates in any given quarter. Our goal is to give the best value to our customers, and we continue to be a market leader in corporate brands. Corporate brands introduced 588 new items in the grocery department in 2012. Many of these were sold under our new Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands, which had fiscal 2012 sales that exceeded our internal goal by 33%. Obviously, this has been a huge home run.
 We plan to continue developing innovative products that solve for unmet needs and that our customers won't find anywhere else in 2013. Our practice has been to disclose our corporate brands' share in grocery category only. The reason for not using a broader base was the introduction of new items in categories where we previously had not been broadly represented. We felt this would have portrayed our growth in a too-favorable light. With this behind us, we plan to begin giving a view of our share across a broader portion of the store in future quarters.
 As you know, our commitment to improving the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, our people, products, prices and shopping experience, sets us apart from many of our other food retailers. While many of our competitors do well in one or more of these areas, very, very few excel in all 4 of them. I'd like to share a couple of examples how we are seeking to improve our connection to customers through the non-price key of our Customer 1st Strategy.
 An important area of focus for us is improving our digital connection with customers through our mobile phone app and on the web at kroger.com. We offer Kroger customers the ability to check their fuel points, download coupons instantly to their shopper cart, create a shopping list and order pharmacy prescription refills virtually wherever they are. We know that customers who are digitally engaged with Kroger are more loyal than those customers who aren't, which is why we recently began promoting our digital offering to connect with more customers on our digital platforms. In a short period of time, we've seen visits to our mobile app increase by more than 120% and a 45% increase in traffic to kroger.com and growth in the number of customers who have signed up for online and mobile accounts with Kroger.
 Another measure of our growing digital connection is the total number of digital coupons that have been downloaded. In December, we hit a milestone of more than 500 million digital coupons downloaded by our customers. We see only opportunity by improving our offering in the digital arena, particularly as we leverage our world-class loyalty program with dunnhumbyUSA.
 Our customers are also eating more seafood as part of their weekly diet, making seafood one of the fastest-growing commodities we sell. To meet this growing demand today and in the future, we support both wild-caught and farm-raised fishery improvement projects around the world so customers can know with confidence that the seafood they buy at Kroger is always fresh, high quality and sustainably sourced. Just last month, we helped launch the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative, or GSSI, to ensure that certification programs continue to successfully evaluate and validate our suppliers' best-in-class sustainability efforts. Kroger is proud to be the only U.S.-based retailer to hold a seat on the GSSI steering board, and we are also a founding member.
 Finally, I'd like to give you an update on labor relations. Our associates play a big part in building customer loyalty. Kroger's commitment to our associates include our dedication to safety, significant investments in training, solid wages and good quality, affordable health care. We have to deliver on this in ways that allow us to operate competitively with the non-union retailers in each of the markets that we serve. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective. Growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We were pleased that our associates ratified a series of new labor agreements covering stores in Portland and throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington. Currently, negotiations are underway with the UFCW for store associates in the Indianapolis area. In 2013, we have labor contracts expiring in Michigan, Houston, Dallas, Cincinnati and Seattle. 
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's 2012 financial results and our guidance for 2013. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Obviously, our numbers are a little difficult to dissect this quarter. As I go through our results, there are 3 important comparisons that we want to make sure you understand: first, how we performed compared to our guidance in 2012; second, how we compare our fiscal 2012 results to fiscal 2011; and third, to show you how we calculated our growth rate for 2013.
 Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $461.5 million, or $0.88 per diluted share. LIFO was $0.09 per diluted share lower than estimated, and a discrete tax item added $0.02 per diluted share to the results for the quarter. These 2 items were not contemplated in our guidance. Excluding the benefit of these items, we exceeded earnings per diluted share expectations by $0.07.
 Comparing our fourth quarter results to the prior year, net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter grew 22%. To calculate this, we excluded the extra week from the fourth quarter of 2012 and adjusted fourth quarter 2011 for the UFCW pension plan consolidation charge and to make LIFO comparable between the 2 quarters. This is illustrated in Table 6 of our press release.
 We recorded a $41.2 million LIFO credit during the quarter compared to a $73.4 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We reminded you in the third quarter that we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge, and many of the items we discuss are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for any given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. If LIFO is lower than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be higher than our targets. And if LIFO is higher than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be lower than our targets. This is why we excluded the benefit of our lower-than-expected LIFO charge when comparing to guidance and calculating growth rates.
 FIFO gross margin excluded retail fuel operations and the extra week decreased 43 basis points from the same period last year. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the extra week, declined 70 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.
 Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2012 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that over time is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.127 compared to $0.121 in the same quarter last year after adjusting 2,000 -- after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.139 compared to $0.138 after adjusting for an additional week.
 Turning now to Kroger's full year 2012 results. For the full year 2012, total sales increased $96.8 billion or -- to $96.8 billion, or 7.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. After adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2012, total sales increased to $94.8 billion, or 4.9% compared with the prior fiscal year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6% over that same time period. And further adjusting for the extra week, total sales excluding fuel increased 4%. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.5% in fiscal 2012 compared with the prior year.
 Net earnings for fiscal year 2012 totaled $1.5 billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. These results include LIFO being lower than our guidance by $0.08 per diluted share and the discrete tax item that added $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and the $0.14 per diluted share effect from the credit card settlement and a reduction in the UFCW pension accrual in the third quarter. Collectively, these totaled $0.24 per diluted share and were not contemplated in our guidance of $2.44 to $2.46 per diluted share.
 So comparing our performance without these items to guidance, we exceeded the high end of our range by $0.07 per diluted share. Comparing our 2012 results to the prior year, net earnings per diluted share in 2012 grew 16%. In order to calculate this, we believe adjustments to 2012 and 2011 are required. Adjustments for 2012 included the benefits gained from the pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter and excluding the extra week. In 2011, adjustments included the UFC pension plan consolidation charge in the fourth quarter and making LIFO comparable to 2012. This calculation is illustrated in Table 6 of our press release. The fact that we beat our own earnings guidance for the year even after raising it upwards several times throughout the year demonstrates the underlying strength of our core business and the bit of our -- benefit of our share buybacks to increase shareholder value.
 Kroger recorded a full year LIFO charge of approximately $55 million. The company's fiscal 2011 full year LIFO charge was $216 million. As Dave and Rodney said earlier, we expect -- currently expect a slightly expanded FIFO operating margin on a rolling 4-quarters basis. On this basis, FIFO operating margin excluding fuel and the extra week increased by 6 basis points. This also excludes the benefits of the credit card settlement and the reduction in UFC pension accrual, both of which incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We are pleased that we were able to deliver on our commitment, and it remains our goal to continue to slightly improve Kroger's non-fuel operating margin rate over time. 
 For 2013, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged. We're going to fund capital investments, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. Capital investments, excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2 billion for the year compared to $1.9 billion in 2011. For 2013, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range for the year.
 During the fourth quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.2 million common shares for an investment of $57 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has $466 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012. Net total debt was $8.6 billion, an increase of $470.6 million from a year ago. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.04 compared to 2 during the same period last year. Our objective is maintain our current debt rating, and we believe a net total debt to EBITDA ratio of 2x to 2.2x will support this objective.
 Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2013. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2013. We expect identical sales to trend up during the year as we lap higher inflation early in the year and the effect of generics in the second half of the year.
 Full year net earnings for fiscal 2013 are expected to range from $2.71 to $2.79 per diluted share. This equates to the company's long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% from the adjusted fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share of $2.52, as shown in Table 6 of our press release. To calculate our base, we excluded the benefits gained from the pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter and the extra week, and we also normalized LIFO.
 Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend of 2% to 2.5% for a total shareholder return of approximately 10% to 13.5%. When looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the following: the low end of our growth rate -- we expect quarter 1 to be at the low end of our growth rate, inflation is expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2013, and the growth of our pharmacy business won't be as substantial as last year's first quarter. We expect the second and third quarters to be at the high end to above our growth rate expectations as inflation is expected to become more comparable between the years, and we expect our ID sales to be trending up. For the fourth quarter, we expect lower than the prior year on a 12-week to 12-week basis, due primarily to a budgeted LIFO charge of $13 million versus a credit of $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.
 We expect our full year LIFO charge to be approximately $55 million for 2013. This is the same as our LIFO charge for fiscal 2012. Where it ultimately ends up could be one of the factors that will determine where we land in the $2.71 to $2.79 EPS range. A higher LIFO charge would move us down in the range and a lower LIFO charge would move us up in the range.
 As I said earlier, we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2013, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to fiscal 2012 results. This morning, we filed an 8-K summarizing the guidance and financial strategy that I just discussed and some additional items including pension contributions and expense and our tax rate expectations.
 Now I will turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. And as you can tell, we're very pleased with our financial results for the quarter and the year. Kroger's performance is the result of our associates' hard work and commitment to make each day better for our customers. We grew our business in 2012. And building on that momentum, we expect to deliver the growth in 2013 that we outlined at our investor meeting in October.
 Now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: I remember at the Analyst Day, you had referenced the incremental CapEx would be a pressure to your SG&A in the near term, yet you still held that 8% to 11% range. Is there something as you look out to 2013 that gives you greater confidence than the long-term range and maybe if you can just give us a little more color? 
J. Schlotman: Well, the increased capital, it'll have an effect on holding down our ROIC ability to grow that in the short term. We do expect to continue to not have that go down but, as Rodney said, grow it in the near term. As we open the stores, if you look at our guidance, we opened up 44 stores in 2012 and we're projecting 45 to 50 in 2013. So that's not a dramatic increase year-on-year that would have any kind of material effect on -- or from a preopening cost standpoint or the ramp-up of those new stores. 
Stephen Grambling: Okay, that's helpful. And then one other quick detail. On the pharmacy business, how should we be thinking about the generic shift impact in the quarter? And I know you referenced that it'll be a little bit less next year, but maybe if you can help us quantify that? 
David Dillon: Let me make a comment first and then I'll ask Rodney to answer the specific question. But I wanted to make the broad observation that our pharmacy business this past year was outstanding. And I want to make sure that anybody who's touched our pharmacy business in our organization knows how we feel about that. We were absolutely thrilled. So Rodney, you want to comment about the generic effect? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The generic effect kept getting bigger and bigger as we went through the year, and we're just now starting to cycle the beginning parts of that. So the heavy -- the largest effect will be in the first and second quarters. It'll get a little smaller in the third and fourth, but not tremendously smaller. And we also obviously have a few more drugs going to generic. So we believe it will be a headwind from a sales standpoint throughout the year. One of the things that's very positive, as Dave mentioned, we had a great year on pharmacy. And so far this year, we've continued to have a strong script count growth in pharmacy as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Wanted to ask you, Dave, when you mentioned the variability in sales, I'm not surprised to hear that given all that's going on in the macro environment. But has that increased a lot compare -- I think you had mentioned it last quarter, too, and I asked you about it. But is that something that's -- the amplitude, the amount of variability is increasing. Or is that something to call out that we should think about? 
David Dillon: I think we've seen it more amplified in the last 6 months or so than it had been, and that's why I called it out last quarter. And I think what we saw this last quarter was much of the same. Now last year was also hampered by the fact that there was a 2-day swing in the calendar because of leap day a year ago and when you come to the first of month or end of the month. And we've now rounded that, so we don't have that issue to contend with. But the issues that I was referring to really is the fragile nature of the consumer, and I think that they ended up swinging with -- almost with that day's news. Now that may be a little bit of an exaggeration, but you can see, as we do our polling, you can see heightened awareness. In January, for instance, on taxes -- I mean, that just shows crystal clear that it was on their minds. And I think it's things like that, that caused them to have that swing in how they approach their own daily living. 
Andrew Wolf: So that polling information, that's correlating somewhat with sale -- behavior and people... 
David Dillon: Well, actually, we're calling out specifically in this case because sometimes, we can see behavior in sales as we did actually see it a couple years ago when the debt ceiling was been debated. But this time, when you look at the payroll tax, lots was written about the payroll tax, and lots of people were assuming. Of course, it's early in that process, so I don't know that we'll feel differently -- could feel differently down the road. But right now, what we see is taxes and the payroll tax and other issues like that on people's minds in a very noticeable way, and we see the variability from day to day, week to week. But we do not see what we think is a dollar sales impact in total on what's happening from the payroll tax. 
J. Schlotman: The other thing on top of that is, in some states, government transfer payments, the way those payments are made, have changed, and we haven't yet cycled a year with the new schedule on transfer payments being made to recipients. So that creates some of the volatility as well. 
Andrew Wolf: Okay. One follow-up then I'll cede because of your one-question rule. Did the delay in tax payments, do you think that also affected the cadence and the variability in the sales results? 
David Dillon: It certainly could have. It wasn't a big enough factor that we would be able to -- that we were able to discern it specifically in our minds. But it's one of the factors that I think we would list, and it's what was going on in the consumer's world. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth: It's Mark Wiltamuth. We saw a number of other retailers show some holiday cautiousness on the part of consumers. Did you see any of that across the demographic cuts that you do as you look at your data? 
David Dillon: Well, of course there were some signs of caution. But on the other hand, actually, we were pleased with our holiday selling period and the weeks that followed, actually, too. So I would say nothing that should be called out at this point. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? 
W. McMullen: No. 
David Dillon: No. 
Mark Wiltamuth: And Mike, if you could maybe quantify your health care and pension headwinds because you still have a strong earnings growth story here, but it sounds like there are some headwinds we just can't see behind the scenes. 
J. Schlotman: Well, health care and pension headwinds are always out there. We -- in the 8-K, we filed what we expect our contributions to the union funds to be for pensions, and that dollar for dollar is an expense item. Whatever we contribute is an expense. The other item that's out there is the amount of expense we expect for the company-sponsored pension plan. And that's actually a little lower next year than we would have originally expected. But those items are always out there. It's one of the reasons why our identical sales performance is so important. And our goal is to be able to grow identical sales faster than our underlying costs are going so we can make the operating profit margin growth be what we expect. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Ajay Jain: Maybe I'll address this to Mike Schlotman. I noticed your D&A was lower compared to last year, and I think it was down more materially if you account for the calendar shift. So just wondering, is there any change in your schedule? Can you just talk about what's driving that decrease? And what's implicit in your 2013 guidance for D&A expense? 
J. Schlotman: I wouldn't say there's anything specific that winds up being in there. Some of it's just reflective of some older stuff becoming fully depreciated. As you know, when you look at our CapEx, keep in mind not everything we spend capital on gets depreciated because we like owning our properties. So therefore, we buy the land, and that doesn't wind up in depreciation. So it doesn't affect that. We would expect the depreciation to be up a little bit in 2013 compared to 2012 on an apples-to-apples basis. 
Ajay Jain: Okay. And just as a follow-up, maybe you guys mentioned it earlier and I might have missed it, but I just wanted to ask if you could comment on the intra-quarter ID trends? 
David Dillon: Yes. The ID trends grew. By the 13th period, they were the strongest of the quarter, which is our last period of that quarter. And in fact, you didn't ask about it, but I'll add the additional 4 quarter -- or 4 weeks, rather, 4.5 weeks that we've had since that time. If you take the 13th period and the 4.5 weeks since that time, they both were about the same, and they both exceeded actually slightly above what our sales range guidance is for the year 2013. So we're pleased with that. We did have some weather in the last few weeks that has positively helped our sales. But even if you take that out, I think we were solidly -- certainly above the midpoint of what the guidance is that we gave. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: I wanted to drill down a little bit on sort of the market share performance. So if I'm right, the share gains have moderated a little bit, say, from '11 and '10. Is that just because the prior gains were unsustainable and where we are now is more sustainable? Or I don't know how you've dove into that and taken a look at that. And then as part of that, if you then looked at loyal households, you looked at different customer groups and/or different competitors, is there something where, as you dice it, the market share gains are actually stronger or accelerating with certain customers and again, certain competitors? 
David Dillon: Let me take a shot at the market share question, and then I'll see if Rodney wants to bring that and the loyal households together. But on the market share, I would encourage you not to think of it as an accounting number and with precision. I would think of it as more a directional picture. It's a very helpful indicator of where things are headed, but I think it's more important really to look at it in combination with other things. So the first thing we noted on our market share was that it has been growing in the second half of the year so that you can assume that  the comparison for the year, that we're -- we may have had -- we had some -- we did have. In fact, we talked about some of the struggles we had with tonnage early last year, and that's changed. Our tonnage through the last half of this past year was strong. And in fact, as I indicated on the sales so far in the 4.5 weeks we've had it in this quarter, our tonnage continued strong, too. So if you combine the sales trends we've experienced, the tonnage we have experienced with what the ACNielsen material shows us, it's certainly directionally strong. Yes, it may be a little bit less than what it had been, but I don't -- in terms of market share. But I don't think it's a meaningful variance. I don't think that the numbers are that accurate that we can see that kind of variance in them. Rodney, you may want to add to that, and feel free to comment on the households. 
W. McMullen: Yes. I would -- I agree completely. And as Dave and I both mentioned, and I mentioned earlier, we've improved during the year. So actually, the last half of the year, the gains were better than the overall year. When you look at customer segments, the value customer early in the year, we were very soft on share with that type of customer, and it's improved nicely. But that would have been the -- earlier in the year, that would have been a very soft area of our share by segment. If you look at more a traditional and upscale customer, those customer gains were really, across the year, and continue to be very nice. 
John Heinbockel: And when you guys look at -- to Dave's point, you think it's -- share and comp together is probably a good matrix to use. And the levels we're at today, you're comfortable with. I would also think as the capital program picks up, share will pick up. Maybe there's some cannibalization, but share should pick up as you roll out more stores, correct? 
David Dillon: I would agree with all of that. I would add to the metric. I would add tonnage, too. So I'd look at ID sales, tonnage and then what the ACNielsen material shows. And I'd look for the intersection of what those 3 things together are telling us. That's how we look at it. 
W. McMullen: And there's not one single number that gives you all the answers, and that's one of the things that your comment really highlights, is you really need to look across more than one to get a feel overall. But at the end of the day, we felt very good about the progress we made on share gain last year in all markets. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I would like to actually talk a little bit more about tonnage. I thought there were comments that you were making last year that the tonnage weakness was, to some extent, a result of high inflation at the beginning of the year. And then produce was deflationary, so you started to see some tonnage improvement. Is it fair to think about it in that sort of broad sense about the consumer and pricing? Or do think that whatever happens with tonnage is just based on what you guys do? 
David Dillon: Meredith, I think it's actually both, personally. We were -- I think we admitted a little surprise in how quickly tonnage returned when inflation subsided. I thought it would take longer than it did. And so obviously, that has -- it has something to do with the fact that inflation subsided. But I also would like to think that we positioned ourselves really well to take advantage of that situation by the investments we've made in price and with the improvements that we continue to make in the other 3 keys in our stores. So I really think it ends up being both. 
Meredith Adler: Okay, great. And then I wanted to -- you had great success in terms of controlling expenses in the fourth quarter, and congratulations on that. I know there's always a whole lot of different things you're working on, but is there anything that particularly stood out in the fourth quarter? And did the extra week, which we had guessed would benefit $0.07, and it benefited by $0.11, did the extra week contribute particularly much to that improvement in SG&A -- or OG&A? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Thanks, Meredith, for the comment. And on the OG&A improvement that I mentioned on the call, it was adjusted for the extra week so we did not get any benefit in the number that I shared. In terms of specifics to call out, it was really broad based. It's almost every division of the company, and it's really core operations. Obviously, having good tonnage growth and identical sales gives you some tailwind, so we had that across the whole company, which was helpful, but just very good execution on our strategy and the things that we've identified. I wouldn't highlight one, Mike or Dave. I... 
W. McMullen: No, I agree with you. It's actually refreshing that there's not one to highlight. That means there's a lot of things contributed to it, and the fact that it's broad based can make it sustainable. 
David Dillon: And I do tend to look at that number over a longer period. One quarter is good. The number Rodney used in his -- in the prepared comments was the full year number, and I think that's a better reflection of how we did. Now that's still pretty darn good. But I tend to look over a long haul because the longer the period, the more likely that what you did is sustainable. And the things we did were really process-oriented. And changes that our customers actually either prefer or don't notice, either one. 
Meredith Adler: And then my final question would just be about labor, and maybe you could talk about -- you don't have to talk about any individual contract, but in terms of generally the negotiation, are you able to stick with kind of the total numbers you want to get in terms of labor cost increases, balancing the health care, pension and wages? 
David Dillon: Well, there's 2 balances we actually -- probably more that we try to make each time. First -- or probably second is the one you mentioned, is balancing the health care costs, pension costs and so forth, and those are going to continue to be issues that need to be addressed. But the first balance that we actually try to address is on one hand, we do have the natural tension of wanting and needing to keep our expenses down low as a company. On the other hand, we genuinely want our associates to be fairly paid, certainly paid based on what the market rates are and so forth. We have a workforce that we've very proud of, and we don't look at this as something that is some opposition argument. We're trying to actually work on their side on this argument. We're trying to find a way to balance the business needs with what our associates need. So that's how we think of the labor. Now, Rodney, you may have some specifics. 
W. McMullen: No. 
David Dillon: That's it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise from USB (sic) [UBS]. 
Jason DeRise: It's Jason DeRise at UBS. I wanted to ask a question on guidance, and I guess it's multipart and so I'm going to put them all together, and then what you're able to share will be great in terms of the color. So obviously, we have the square footage piece of that, but it's not a net. So I'm wondering if you can share what you're planning in terms of closures. Obviously, you're not going to be able to share what acquisitions you're planning on doing, unless you want to. Feel free to. And then in terms of the FIFO x-fuel gross margin, if you can share some thoughts on what you think between the gross margin element and the SG&A leverage? And then I guess the other ones that aren't mentioned directly but are going to be important in understanding this is the fuel contribution expected and the buybacks expected. So basically, the question is asking for more color on the guidance. 
J. Schlotman: The square footage at this point in time, we always give what we expect gross square footage to do. Our model is not built needing any acquisitions to make our numbers, so that's why we always say excluding acquisitions. If there were something out there that worked, it would be something that's additive to our results because we don't need to do anything to have -- to reach our growth expectations. Relative to the closures, while there are certainly a handful that are out there, that's something that occurs throughout the year as we constantly look at our portfolio of assets and look at what stores may need to close. I don't have a specific number for that at this point that we would -- that I would be willing to disclose. Relative to... 
Jason DeRise: Can I ask if it would be a -- we would expect a net positive number? Because I mean I guess, last year, there was a positive gross number out there, but it... 
J. Schlotman: It's been a net positive for the last several years. Sometimes, what happens is we -- there have been occasions where we've closed a couple smaller stores and opened up one bigger store. And it looks like our store count goes down, but that bigger store is actually more square footage than the 2 stores we closed on a combined basis. So that certainly helps. When you look at the FIFO fuel gross margin and without fuel gross margin and SG&A leverage, we don't give specific guidance on those line items. We always expect to get SG&A savings that we'll invest back on our 4 keys, whatever line that key might fall in the income statement. And our overall goal was to grow our operating margin for the year slightly from the prior year, and that would remain our goal for this year. And relative to fuel contribution, I would say, typically, when we go into a year and when you, for instance, when you look at the fourth quarter of the year, it was only $0.01 difference without the extra week between the 2 years' fourth quarters. So the growth in that is not something that's a huge driver of the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth rate. 
W. McMullen: Usually, we just use what, Mike, a 3-year rolling average in terms of the actual results and use that as a base point. 
J. Schlotman: Right. Look at gross margin per gallon over the last 3 years, and that's about where we start. 
Jason DeRise: Okay. All of that's useful. I guess, in terms -- just to follow-up on the gross margin element. Within this last quarter that you talked about, I guess it's your inflation cost that you're talking about at 1.7%, but your large national competitor was talking about how their basket inflation was 0.8%. So I mean, if you're passing through that, most of that 1.7%, there's a gap there. I know a lot of people in the market are trying to interpret how the new 8% to 11% guidance -- what that means in terms of your aggressiveness in price or if you're pulling back. So if you can share some thoughts on that, if maybe your pricing isn't as aggressive in the quarter as it has been relative to your competition? 
W. McMullen: It's really a little bit of apples and oranges. What we measure is our estimated inflation based on using government statistics on inflation by category at the mix of business we have. If you look at the actual basket that customers are buying from us, it would have a completely different inflation rate, and it would actually be meaningfully less, especially if the customer has pharmacy in their basket, it's substantially less. So it's -- those 2 are really apples and oranges. And what we try to give on an inflation rate is more based on our sales mix and some of the government statistics out there. 
Jason DeRise: Do you feel that you maintained or improved your price position during the quarter? 
W. McMullen: Our internal measures would all show that we've improved our relative price position versus all our major competitors, not just the one that you mentioned. 
David Dillon: And we have no expectation that, that will change. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of firm BMO Capital. 
Karen Short: Back on the inflation and the LIFO for a minute. When you guys gave your guidance for the LIFO charge for the full year in your third quarter call, it seemed like you kind of expected inflation to come in where it came in for the year. So I guess I'm confused about the credit this quarter. And then looking to next year, I guess what are your expectations on inflation for next year? Because given the LIFO charge for this year, just kind of going back to your P&L in prior years, it would look like you're kind of expecting like 1-ish percent. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. In the -- at the end of the third quarter when we gave our expectation for LIFO, our expectation at that time was that our full year LIFO charge would be $125 million. So through 10 periods, we had expensed enough to have 10/13 of $125 million behind us. So when the year wound up at only $55 million by the time we got to the end of the year, we had almost $95 million, a little over $95 million accrued. So we had to reduce that number down to the $55 million, which led to the credit in the fourth quarter. That make sense? 
Karen Short: Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then for next year, your inflation expectations? 
J. Schlotman: Relative to next year, at this point in time, we're estimating LIFO to be at $55 million for next year, just like this year. As we sit here today, with inflation in the 1 percentage kind of range, maybe a little over, depending how pharmacy winds up affecting that, we think that's the best guess at this time. The other thing to keep in mind is inflation throughout the year has no effect on LIFO. So the fact that last year was very high early in the year and then it trended down throughout the year doesn't really affect LIFO. It is a single day point in time calculation of how many products do I have this year, what was last year's price and this year's price on that particular day. Now that's a little bit of a Reader's Digest version of how the calculation works, but it gets you close. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then wondering if you'd be prepared to give CapEx allocation for next year? 
J. Schlotman: You mean how much capital investment we plan to make? Or... 
Karen Short: No, the allocation in -- I mean, you gave the dollars in your 8-K, but wondering if you could give the allocation? 
J. Schlotman: You mean allocation by what we're sort of spending on stores and things like that? 
Karen Short: Category. Yes. 
J. Schlotman: Well, I wouldn't get into the exact dollar amount of allocation, but we also gave guidance that we expect to do one -- a few more stores, new relocate and expands in 2013 compared to 2012 and probably a comparable number of remodels. 
W. McMullen: Most of the dollar increase would be driven by the store-in program that we've outlined incrementally. 
J. Schlotman: And the other thing to keep in mind is as we're increasing our capital spend to focus on existing and some new fill-in markets as well as exploring new markets, it takes a while for those stores to open. So we'll be spending dollars in 2013 that wind up being 2014 store openings. So the growth in that store count takes a while because the spending happens so far in advance of that. So it'll be a slow growth or a slow build into the higher store count. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a last question, maybe if you could give some color on both the competitive and the acquisition environment? It seems like, on the acquisition side, there may be some assets coming up or presenting themselves shortly? And then comments on the competitive environment? 
David Dillon: Well, on the acquisition environment, I would just give you the comments we've made before. We don't generally comment. What we've tried to do is share with you our philosophy how we approach that, and that really hasn't changed at all from the past. As to the competitive environment, I would characterize it as we have recently, it's still a hotly contested market, a very competitive kind of a business. That's the nature of our business. But I see people making rational choices. I don't see it as performing irrationally, which is a good thing in our minds and, I presume, in yours too. Rodney, anything else you want to add to that? 
W. McMullen: No. No. No. 
David Dillon: Okay. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: So I was hoping we could dig into the gross margin, the FIFO gross margin a little bit this quarter. It was a little bit lighter than what I thought it was going to be. And I think if you were to look at it and remove the generic benefit, my guess, and this is where I'm hoping you could help, but my guess is the selling gross margin this quarter is probably weaker than what we've seen otherwise this year. So could you maybe just give us some more detail on selling, what's going on, on the shrink side, maybe the non-selling side and how this -- how the margin played out versus what you were expecting? 
W. McMullen: It really played out very close to what we were expecting. And as you know, one of the things that we always work on is making sure we balance with our expense improvements. And any given quarter, you can't always get a balance perfectly. But for the year, we work really hard to get those 2 balanced. And it's driven as much by balancing those 2 pieces. If you look at it versus what we were expecting, it was very close to what we were expecting. Obviously, the generics improved gross margin, selling gross margins for the quarter. But overall, we were pleased with where it ended up and felt good about the balance. And we felt good about our relative price position in the market from a competitive standpoint. 
J. Schlotman: Rodney, I agree. And when you look at operating profit margin, which is what we always focus on, the fact we grew it by 6 basis points when really through 3 quarters year-to-date we were slightly negative, demonstrates the strong cost control. And the fact that we really -- as Rodney said, our -- we executed the plan we had, and it came to fruition in the fourth quarter because a lot of what occurred was somewhat planned. It was planned. So... 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And on the repo front, share repurchase, how should we think about '13? I mean, it's obvious that you're not probably going to buy back nearly as much stock this upcoming year as you did in the past. Will you still be borrowing to maintain a leverage ratio and then using that to buy stock? 
W. McMullen: Again, the use of our cash flow, including maintaining our net total debt to EBITDA ratio in our 2x to 2.2x range, will really be used for all 4 of the things we laid out, and that's to fund our capital investments; to repurchase shares; maintain and hopefully, over time, grow our dividend; as well as maintaining our current credit rating. So we'll balance all of those needs. Relative to the stock share buyback, we would expect to continue to buy in shares. We obviously didn't buy as much in the fourth quarter as we had throughout the course of the year. That was not any kind of a statement on where our share price was in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year. It was really based on the fact that we were cognizant of where our debt levels were going into the fourth quarter, and the fact of the way the rating agencies look at our debt level, things like our $250 million contribution to our EBIT [ph] at the end of the year, it's a very smart thing to do from a tax standpoint because we accelerate the tax deduction. But even though that burns off in the first few months of the next fiscal year, they treat it as debt at the end of the year. So I would have -- it made great return sense to make that contribution and get the tax deduction this year versus next year and balance that with how much free cash flow that leaves me to buy in shares. So we try to balance all of our needs on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Kelly Bania: I was wondering if you could go back to some comments you made a little earlier about the value and the traditional and upscale consumers and how the value kind of improves through the year. I was wondering, one, what do you think has driven that? Have you been catering to that a little bit better as we move through the year? And two, how do you think the volatility -- the mild volatility that you saw in January, how did that impact those different customer segments? 
W. McMullen: Yes, in terms of -- it would definitely have been targeted things that we did looking at the customer. It's one of the things that's such a wonderful benefit of our partnership with dunnhumby. That example was on a value customer, but we'd really look at it on every customer segment. We're constantly testing marketing, direct marketing with different customers and different methods of direct marketing. And when something connects, we do more of it. When it doesn't connect, we don't do it as much. And when we're not satisfied with our performance, we will work and put some extra focus there. So it really was something that we weren't pleased with, we weren't connecting as well as we liked and made some changes to make sure that we did, and that improvement happened. In January, it's really hard -- as Dave mentioned before, it's really hard to see some of the external numbers affecting -- the external things that went on, we don't really see it in our numbers. We believe some of that is probably really driven because we had connected better with some of those customer segments for some of the things we had put in place. What happened at other companies, we really don't have insight into that. But we really didn't see the -- in total, the variability as we mentioned from a day-to-day basis we do. 
Kelly Bania: Great. And then if I can just squeeze in one more follow-up. Can you give any color on the tonnage trends? As you look back over the year between the core grocery categories and the fresh, you mentioned kind of the seafood being strong. But any more color there you can give us? 
W. McMullen: It improved throughout the year, and it was broad based on the improvement in all categories. So it really would be difficult to call out one area being stronger than the other. The only area that I would probably specifically call out is, obviously, pharmacy had great script count growth throughout the year, and our natural foods area had a phenomenal year as well. And it was strong throughout the year. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Greg Hessler from Bank of America. 
Gregory Hessler: So I apologize, I missed a little bit of the beginning of the call. I was just wondering if you could talk about the upcoming maturity, the $400 million maturity in April? Do you plan to turn that out into debt capital markets? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. We've talked -- we have not talked about that yet on the call. We actually had a maturity right at the beginning of this fiscal year that we drew down -- that we actually have refinanced with commercial paper on a temporary basis. And then, as you said, we have the other maturity in April. Our expectation would be that sometime in April, that we would term those out. If you look at our SEC filings, we already have a significant amount of that kind of an issuance contemplated and hedged out from an interest rate standpoint, and that coverage goes out until April. So it may not be the exact day. But dependent on market conditions, I would expect, somewhere around that time, we will wind up terming those out. 
Gregory Hessler: Okay. So that could be maybe up to $1 billion in size. Any thoughts on tenor there? Do you have any preference for shorter-dated stuff? Or should we be thinking about 10s or 30s? Or what are your thoughts there? 
J. Schlotman: We'll let the market tell us where the sweet spot is. Sometimes, we may start out with a particular idea. And then we find out, as you start to look at the market on that particular day, that there's a hole on our maturity chart that fits with what the market has an appetite for on that particular day. So rather than lock myself in, when we go to market, we'll let the market tells us what makes the most sense. 
David Dillon: And before we end the call today, I would like to share a few additional thoughts with our associates who we encouraged to listen in today. 2013 marks the 130th anniversary when Barney Kroger opened his first store in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is an amazing accomplishment, and yet 2 of our banners have been in business even longer: Ralph's division, which is 140 years old; and the Jay C Foods division, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year.
 Our heritage of enduring growth and reinvention gives us great confidence for the future. Each of you played a big part in the success in 2012. Working together as a team, we made shopping more easy and efficient for our customers, and they're giving us credit for all of our hard work. We also helped keep costs under control so that we could invest the savings and lower prices. A special thanks to each of you for your contributions.
 This week, we also thank 36 special Kroger associates for their extraordinary efforts for our company and our communities. We honor these associates because they represent strong leadership, courage and character. They live our leadership model and our values by leading effective teams, serving local community organizations, making healthy lifestyle changes and more. You can find more about each of our honorees by watching our live quarterly broadcast tomorrow or reading their inspiring stories at the greatpeople.me website in the coming weeks.
 That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2013 Q3  (2012-11-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Derek, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Derek, and thank you, everyone, for your patience while we work out these technical issues. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. If you're on the call, it probably means you did not win the Powerball last night. We do apologize for the technical phone difficulties we had earlier, and thank you for sticking with us.
 With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 We are obviously delighted about the numbers we just released. Both our GAAP and our adjusted earnings per share growth are the result of the powerful foundation that we have laid for our business to grow. Our core business drove earnings per share growth by more than 20%. This strong result excludes the 2 items identified in our earnings release and the swing in LIFO from year to year.
 This was a remarkable quarter by several measures. We achieved our 36th consecutive quarter positive ID supermarket sales growth, we realized a record third quarter earnings per share, we increased total FIFO operating profit dollars and we saw the highest increase in unit movement since the second quarter of 2010.
 This quarter illustrates that the strength of our core business positions Kroger to accelerate our earnings per share growth. The economy is slowly improving, but value customers are still struggling. We continue to monitor changes in gas prices and inflation. Customer concern over fuel and energy costs lessened as gas prices declined through the quarter. Rodney will have more to say about declining inflation shortly, which contributed to the growth in our unit movement in the quarter. Overall consumer confidence is up, but it remains fragile. Uncertainty around issues like the fiscal cliff can have a short-term impact on consumer sentiment, as we saw last year during the debt ceiling debate. Kroger is well positioned to successfully navigate through these factors.
 I'd like to say thank you again for your participation in the Investor Conference in New York City last month. The purpose of that event was to outline for you our plans to accelerate Kroger's earnings growth. We're implementing our long-term growth strategy, and we are committed to achieving fully diluted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% plus a higher dividend over time, supported by targeting capital expenditures to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging dunnhumby insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. That is what we believe will grow Kroger and shareholder value, and we are bullish about our future.
 Rodney will now discuss how Kroger is executing our growth plans and our positive business results in the third quarter. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It is definitely an exciting time at Kroger. We have aligned our senior leadership team to accelerate our growth strategy. All across the business, our associates are executing to deliver growth results. In 2013, we plan to build, expand or relocate 50 supermarkets compared to 40 expected this year. We are making good progress adding square footage in 4 fill-in markets, and others are being identified based on various metrics. We are narrowing the list of new markets for future expansion.
 Earlier this month, we announced that Kroger will acquire the outstanding shares of Axium Pharmacy, a leading specialty pharmacy that provides specialized drug therapies and support services for patients with complex medical conditions. Axium has the skills Kroger doesn't have, and Kroger's size can help Axium grow. Offering specialty pharmacy services will give our customers greater access to drugs we currently can't dispense and access to additional services that we don't provide today. We're very excited about this new partnership.
 One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the third quarter, we grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. Our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.
 We also achieved positive identical supermarket sales growth for all households. ID sales growth among loyal households outpaced total household growth. Customers continue to visit our stores more frequently and buy more on a monthly basis. Customers also purchased more items on each trip, a welcome change from what we've seen for the last several quarters. As a result, total units sold were up compared to last year. This tonnage growth confirms our belief that we continue to make market share gains in the overall food retailing industry. 
 The rate of product cost inflation in the third quarter continued to flatten faster than originally anticipated. We estimate the rate of inflation declined to 1.4%, excluding fuel. Once again, every store department had inflation with the exception of produce and seafood, which both were deflationary.
 Now before I discuss our sales results, there are a couple events that affected our pharmacy and overall identical supermarket sales results that I want to share. The growth in generic drugs reduced total identical supermarket sales by 1% in the quarter. Our ability to attract and retain Express Script business has largely offset this effect. The effect of generics is consistent with what we outlined at the start of this year.
 I want to congratulate and thank our pharmacy teams for managing through a difficult year. They have done a phenomenal job, and that's an understatement. We are also very pleased with our third quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3.2%, without fuel. The cadence of identical sales throughout the year was balanced. We've also had consistent sales trends through the year when you look at our identical sales, excluding both fuel and pharmacy. And I realize this is a number we normally don't give, but we thought this quarter, you would find it helpful. On this basis, and this is without fuel and pharmacy both, identical sales were a strong 3.2% in the first quarter and 3.1% in the second and third quarters.
 Moving now to Kroger's corporate brands. We recently introduced our new Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands, which are free from 101 artificial ingredients and preservatives that some customers have said they do not want in their foods. Together, these are our fastest growing brands, and we are very excited about our early results.
 Corporate brands represented approximately 26% of grocery department sales dollars in the third quarter, and grocery department corporate brand units sold were 32.9%. Some of the decline in corporate brand share in grocery is due to some CPG companies getting more aggressive and promoting certain items.
 While we strive to grow the corporate brand part of our business over time, we have long said our goal is to give the best value to our customers. And in this quarter, some of the national brands provided a great value. The mix between national brands and corporate brands fluctuate in any given quarter, and we continue to be the market leader in corporate brands.
 Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter as OG&A cost, plus rent and depreciation, without fuel and the 2 adjustment items, were down 21 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis, we have had 7 consecutive years of improvement in this metric, and we expect to achieve our eighth consecutive year in 2012.
 Last quarter, I provided several examples of investments we are making in non-price keys of our Customer 1st Strategy: Our people, products and shopping experience. Today, I'd like to share one of our great people initiatives that is designed to improve the health and wellness of our associates and keep our health care costs down.
 Earlier this year, we partnered with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield to develop an innovative program to provide our associates with access to the top-performing health care providers for several common but expensive surgeries. Participating associates pay less out of pocket at these facilities and benefit from higher quality of care. Kroger pays about 15% less in these hospitals than at others for the same services, even including travel costs. We're excited to be on the leading edge of this kind of program and are pleased with the results so far. We believe it improves our connection with our associates, which in turn strengthens our connection with customers.
 Finally, an update on labor relations. Associates in Arizona, Columbus and Memphis have ratified labor agreements. We continue negotiations on many contracts, including Indianapolis, Nashville and Portland for store clerks and a distribution center in Delaware, Ohio. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages, a quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.
 Next, Mike will share additional detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and guidance for the rest of the year. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to also thank you for your participation in our investors meeting last month. At that meeting, we laid out 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our success, including ID sales growth, FIFO operating margin growth, a stable and growing return on invested capital and market share growth. We believe holding ourselves accountable for these key metrics will drive shareholder value. We will measure our progress on the first 3 on a quarterly basis and continue to report market share growth on an annual basis at year end.
 Rodney went into a lot of detail about the strength of our identical supermarket sales and our ability to leverage operating costs. We are very pleased with our strong performance in these metrics. FIFO gross margin was 20.35% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year.
 Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $316.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share. This includes a $0.14 benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January. Excluding the benefit of these 2 items because they were not the result of our normal operations, Kroger's adjusted net earnings for the third quarter totaled $242.4 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $195.9 million or $0.33 per diluted share.
 I want to spend just a couple of minutes on LIFO. Many of the items we discuss are on a FIFO basis. We manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge. When we develop our expectations for any given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. We don't believe our operation should generate more or less EBITDA because LIFO was higher or lower in a given period of time. As a result, if LIFO was lower than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be higher than our targets. And if LIFO is higher than the prior year, our EPS growth rates will be lower than our targets.
 This quarter is a good example. We reduced our LIFO charge estimate to $125 million for the year. Previously, we internally estimated the LIFO charge at $150 million. The change in LIFO benefited the quarter by $0.02, which you saw in the earnings that we reported.
 Third quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2 adjustment items, increased approximately $29 million over the prior year. Excluding fuel and the adjustment items on a rolling 4 quarters basis, the company's FIFO operating margin was 7 basis points lower compared to last year. Kroger expects to have a slightly higher FIFO operating margin rate, excluding fuel, for the full 2012 fiscal year in line with our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis.
 Return on invested capital in the third quarter was 13.3% compared to 13.5% during the same period last year. As I said in New York, we are committed to growing ROIC over time.
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates. But we view fuel as a core department that over time is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers margin per gallon was approximately $0.149 cents per gallon compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year.
 Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: To fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $473.5 million for the third quarter compared with $497 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range and expect 2013 to be approximately $2.4 billion.
 During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 14.5 million common shares for a total investment of $333 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. As it relates to dividends, you should receive the first payment since our 30% increase this coming Monday.
 Net total debt was $8.7 billion, an increase of $1 billion from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.08 compared to 1.89 during the same period last year. Our objective is to maintain our current debt rating. We believe a net total debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.2 will support this.
 You may notice on our balance sheet that our current portion of our debt is up compared to what it usually is. One of the reasons for this is we had a little over $1 billion outstanding of commercial paper and in our revolving credit facility with our banks that gets classified as short term. Some of that was extra borrowings, which you saw as cash on the balance sheet in anticipation of disruptions in the commercial paper market as a result of Sandy. And some of it is a strategy to fund some of our cash needs on a short-term basis because we're borrowing about 45 to 50 basis points in the commercial paper market to maintain an exposure to floating rates.
 Now I'll update our guidance for the fourth quarter. As a result of solid performance in our core business, Kroger raised its earnings per diluted share guidance, excluding the 2 adjustment items, to $2.44 to $2.46 for the full year, up from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.42. This implies a $0.68 to $0.70 earnings per diluted share result in the fourth quarter. With only 1 quarter left in the year, we believe fourth quarter identical sales guidance is most important. And in the fourth quarter, we expect ID sales between 3% and 3.5%, excluding fuel.
 We also want to remind you as you start thinking about your own estimates for 2013 that you will need to adjust 2012 results to remove the benefit of the extra week and the 2 items that totaled $0.14 from this quarter. We will provide an estimate of the benefit of the 53rd week when we provide full guidance in March.
 Now I will turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. When you look at how Kroger has strengthened our business for the last 10 years and compare us to other food retailers, you'll see that we took the less -- the road less traveled. And when you look today at our ability to deliver positive growth results, you'll understand why we believe that that's made all the difference.
 Kroger's proven Customer 1st Strategy continues to increase customer loyalty, identical sales -- store sales and market share. With that foundation firmly in place, we're focused on deploying capital to further accelerate growth and improve ROIC. We are committed to delivering shareholder value through stronger earnings per share growth, higher dividends and stock buyback.
 We now look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Edward Kelly from Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Just a quick question for you to start on the MEPP benefit. Dave, talking about guidance that excludes the -- well, excludes both the Visa MasterCard settlement as well as MEPP. I don't remember you saying over prior quarters that the guidance excluded the pension benefit. So is that new this quarter or it was always excluded? 
J. Schlotman: Ed, just to clarify, the $50 million reduction that happened this quarter, back in January, we took the $900 million plus charge to establish what that obligation was going to be based on the actuaries' estimate at that point in time. The actuaries recently finished their final work on exactly what that obligation is, and it wound up being $50 million less. So it has nothing to do with what the ongoing cost of that plan is. That was a reduction of the charge we took back in January, and that won't repeat itself. It doesn't have anything to do with the annual cost of that plan. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. So what happened this quarter is truly one time? 
J. Schlotman: It was an adjustment to results. Certain people don't like the use of one time. Yes. 
Edward Kelly: I know. But back in the fourth quarter, you talked about a $0.04 to $0.06 benefit. 
J. Schlotman: And we're delivering on that and that's baked into the numbers, and it's our run rate. This $50 million is above and beyond that, and it was just the true-up of what that initial obligation was. 
Edward Kelly: Perfect. Okay, that makes sense. And then my next question for you is on the gross margin, a little bit better this quarter than what I was expecting sequentially, a nice improvement, I think, lines up pretty well is what you were talking about at the analyst day. Could you just maybe give us a little bit of color around the gross margin? I know last quarter, 45% of the decline was shrink, for instance. So how did that do? How did you do with non-selling versus selling for instance? Could you talk a little bit about that? 
David Dillon: Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, overall, every quarter, what we're trying to do is to balance our improvement in operating costs with a change in gross profit rate. And we continue to be focused on giving our customers a better value than before. So the change in gross profit rate really is given by lowering prices to our customers, and that's what drove it. And we were really pleased with the balance that we had in terms of expense reductions. You specifically asked about shrink. Shrink is an area where we weren't real pleased with our results, but it actually wasn't inconsistent with what I expected. And anytime when you have swings, large swings from heavy inflation to low inflation, it seems that it affects shrink. And I think a lot of the effect this -- the last couple of quarters in shrink has been that. I feel good about where we are overall. As you know, you never want to get so focused on shrink, you hurt yourself. And that's a balance we're always focused on maintaining. 
Edward Kelly: So I mean shrink last quarter hurt you by I think it's 19 basis points if we do that 45%. Was that impact similar this quarter? 
W. McMullen: It wasn't quite that bad, but it wasn't something we were pleased with. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And over the next few quarters, is that something that would diminish, do you think? 
W. McMullen: Certainly, yes. I would certainly expect it would diminish. And what we're trying to do is to make sure we manage it on a progressive and strong basis, but not do something that overreacts. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Deborah Weinswig from Citi. 
Tiffany Kanaga: This is Tiffany Kanaga from Deborah Weinswig's team. We'd like to know what are you seeing in terms of the competitive environment? And how are you thinking about price investments going forward? 
David Dillon: The competitive environment, Tiffany, really hasn't changed. We still see, as we've said just about every quarter, robust competition. About the biggest change we see is one market to another is one market might improve a little bit, another market gets a little tougher. But I certainly don't see it as being harder or difficult today than it was last quarter or easier today than it was last quarter. So I'd say it'd be very similar. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? 
W. McMullen: No. I would agree completely. 
David Dillon: And on the price area, I think Rodney answered that best when he said that our interest is in having balance between what we save in terms of operating costs and what we spend in terms of gross. We have lots of places, we think, additional price investment would give benefit not only to our customers, but would ultimately grow the sales and help the shareholders. But we are tempered in our approach to try to make sure we've offset those with costs. Do you want to add anything? 
W. McMullen: I'm just going to add one other thing, Dave. And as you know, we work a lot with dunnhumby to understand the pricing dollars we have to invest to make sure we invest it in places that helps the customer the most. And we've been doing that for several years. And we would continue to work with dunnhumby to help to make sure that it benefits the customer in the best way we can, for what dollars we do have to invest. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So Dave, you mentioned the economy is slowly improving. Do you see evidence in what people are buying or how they're behaving that they are actually reflecting that and opening up a little more? Or is that -- that's not yet happened? 
David Dillon: Yes, I think we do. I think that -- but the evidence is the slow, gradual improvement that I described. So you look over the last several quarters, you can look at some of the categories we've described before, things like Boar's Head and high-end wines and our fine cheeses, and some of those continue to do pretty good and grow steadily. Natural food is doing well. Another good indicator and one that I'm particularly pleased with, was with our loyalty data. If you look at our loyal households, while we had a big, good solid increase in number of loyal households, the visits, of course, increased. Both of those are consistent with what we've had the last several quarters. But we also had increase in units per visit, an increase there for those loyal households. And I think that's important. I think that's an indication both of us filling all the needs of customers or a greater portion of the needs of customers, which we've talked a lot about before. But I also think it's an indication of people having a little bit more money in their pocket or at least the willingness to buy a little bit more, so that their tentativeness has dissipated somewhat. Now I would caution though, because with value customers, we think that they still are living in a very fragile world, and we think that their situation is still quite difficult. And I'm not actually sure that we've seen improvement there. And we've used the word ourselves in describing the future as pretty fragile. The fragile nature is that you could see high volatility with changes of events, which is why I think the fiscal cliff causes people some heartburn. 
John Heinbockel: Well, I'm going to ask you, as a follow-up on that, how do you plan for the cliff? I guess you would assume we're not going to go over entirely, but the payroll tax probably goes up and some other things happen. So there will be less money in people's pockets come January, low income and middle income as well. How do you plan for that? And do you put programs in place? Are you doing that now, designing some things that you want to hit in January to target a more frugal customer? Or do you think that's an overly negative assessment? 
David Dillon: I'll have Rodney add a little color in a minute. But first, I think it is an overly negative assessment, in fact, quite a bit overly negative in my view. At Kroger, I think we've built up a very strong trust with our customer. For our customers to know that where there's value to be had, they can have it with us. And as a result, I believe that whatever happens, and we think we're in a great position in any of the possible outcomes we can imagine, we think that our customers are going to trust us and continue to stay with us. Now our business is a day-to-day business. We make choices every day as merchants what we're going to do. So we read the environment where we are, we make these choices and we move through current events as we always have done. And I expect that, that will be how we would operate through whatever happens in this situation. I think it's going to be -- whatever happens, I think it's going to be overplayed in the press and so will cause a lot of people a lot of chatter in the outfield, but the actual effect will be less than that. Rodney, you may want to add some... 
W. McMullen: Well, I was just going to say that the uncertainty of things I think is what creates the most pain. And the things that we've been doing for the last several years is really focused on giving the customer a better total value package, and price obviously gets a lot of discussion. But we've improved the shopping experience in the products that the customers get just as much as what we've improved pricing on. And when a customer decides where to shop, they're going to look at the total thing. But the uncertainty of it will affect you. But I don't think there's too much that you can do to anticipate a different strategy for that. We just think long term that it's important to give the customer better total value. 
David Dillon: And John, we don't often get into the public policy arena. And so I'm not certainly trying to forecast what happens. But I do think the one message that's clear from our vantage point is that Congress and the executive branch and the press, frankly, need to look at this responsibly to try to solve the issues and to try not to create undue uncertainty. It's that uncertainty that serves the public really poorly. And we think that there's a lot everyone can do if they make up their mind that they're going to purchase in a responsible way. 
John Heinbockel: And then just finally, one last thing. Do you think that your market share has accelerated -- market share growth or gains have accelerated during 2012? It looks that way, looking at the data that we can see. Do you think that's right? 
David Dillon: I don't know that I'd use the word accelerate. Although it may have, I certainly think it has continued to increase. And we think that that's been a fairly steady increase over time. Rodney, I don't know if you... 
W. McMullen: I would -- yes, I don't know that I would so much word it as accelerate, I think I agree completely with Dave that we see it pretty consistent, improving as it has for the last 5 or 6 years. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you said you're sort of finalizing the criteria for new markets that you might be considering opening stores in. Could you talk a little bit about what those criteria are – criterion are and maybe give us a sense of how you expect to proceed? 
David Dillon: Well, I'll give you a little sense. We obviously won't tell you a lot. And I'm not sure that what I'm going to tell you would be much more than what we said in New York. But our interest is in being able to use our existing infrastructure, warehouses and support and merchandising and so forth. And so that would tend to say that we're not going to go to some markets that are further away, and I think that's probably an accurate reflection. And we're interested in being able to, over time, grow our overall business. We think we've developed a model that the customers really like. And we think that the customers -- and particularly, if you look around, most of the markets we operate in and a bunch of markets we don't operate in, the places that the people are winning in food retailing today actually are mostly in supermarkets. Now you don't see that as much because a lot of those supermarkets are private markets, are not publicly owned, so you don't see the data. But many of the winners are supermarkets. And as a result, we think there's a lot of places that would actually benefit from our kind of store as a supermarket. And we see that as a real plus. Now other than that, I'm not sure that we're going to go out and describe much more. Our objective is to narrow it down to the markets that we think are important and then to do investigation in the real estate side of it and then to proceed through actually operating an action plan, which we would do in almost anything we do really. So that's really the basic plan, but I don't think that adds anything to what I've told you. 
Meredith Adler: Well, this may be a follow-on with that. You had opened a few Food 4 Less stores in Chicago a number of years ago. Do you see the move into new markets or even the fill-in being different kinds of formats than a traditional Kroger? Would it be a marketplace store, more likely to be Food 4 Less or some other discount-oriented store or it'll be a little bit of everything? 
David Dillon: We see all of those as on the table. We like the Food 4 Less format. We like the marketplace format. We like our traditional supermarket format. We like our convenience store format. So we see all of those as having high potential, and it would be based upon the specific market. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? Anything else, Meredith? 
Meredith Adler: Well, I guess I wanted to go back to the question about competition, which you -- I understand is pretty stable. Do you see any risk that rapidly moderating inflation and maybe not everybody's tonnage is recovering as nicely as yours that, that will get -- sort of freak out some of your competitors and we will see more price aggressiveness from them? 
David Dillon: No, I don't expect to see that. And of course, you'll always have some individual markets and some individual settings where that might occur. But on the whole, I view that the competitors that we compete with, whether they're supermarkets, whether they're publicly owned or not, whatever they are, we view it as quite rational. We think people are making rational choices, what they view to be in their best long-term interest, and we certainly are doing the same. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: I'm curious what you would do if you were in a vendors' shoes right now in center store? And the reason I'm asking is across all of food, center store seems to continue to lag. Are you happy with the level and quality of innovation and marketing you're getting from your vendors? You talked about national brands promoting heavily. Is that something you want to see? Or would you rather get fewer dollars from deal backs and just have your vendors spend more money kind of investing in their brands and driving the categories higher that way? I'm just curious how you think about that balance there in the long term. 
David Dillon: I think Rodney will answer that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. Your question on innovation, if you talk to any of us, we would say that no one can ever have enough innovation. It's what makes it fun. And I can tell you every time we have a top-to-top meeting, we're always pushing our CPG partners to have more innovation. It's something that causes the shopping experience to be more fun. It causes the customer to look at somebody's product and obviously, we sell more. From our perspective, we're really kind of indifferent in terms of how a vendor spends their money. Because if they get to where their pricing is too high, that's the reason why we think our corporate brand, our strong corporate brand program is so positive, is because it gives a great value at great quality for our customers. So if a vendor CPG gets to where their price is too high and they spend 20 times as much as they spent before marketing, that balance won't work for them. So we really are focused on how do we work with our CPG partners, how do we grow their business together. And if they get to the point where they get out of balance, we find our corporate brands always picks up share. And as I mentioned in the call, obviously our grocery tonnage was up very nicely in the quarter, and in fact the best since the second quarter of 2010. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. And then one quick one, maybe I missed it. Can you give us some help on what quarter-to-date comps have been? 
David Dillon: We haven't described that yet, but we'd be happy to tell you that. At the moment, quarter-to-date and the fourth quarter were a little bit higher than what we ran in the third quarter. But I would not read too much into that because we expect, as we have seen in the last year or 2, high volatility from 1 week to the next, particularly as the payments for the food stamps, for the staff payments, how that has been smoothed out over some of the months. We've seen even higher volatility compared to the previous year. We do expect to have a good holiday selling season, with Christmas 2 days later from when Thanksgiving falls than last year. We think that actually works well. But a couple of the weeks will be pretty soft weeks. So we're giving you the reading as of today, as through yesterday. But if you look at today's sales, they're going to be pretty sloppy, as an example, because last year was the first of the month where today, it's 2 days before the end of the month. So that's why I urge caution, don't read too much into that. But we're running currently a little bit better than the third quarter. 
W. McMullen: The other thing -- Dave mentioned it, but the swings within a month is a lot more than we had before. And John's earlier question about which customer segments are improving and which ones aren't, if you look at the mainstream and upscale customers, it's pretty consistent and it's solid throughout a month. But a value customer, we see a tremendous amount of more swing today than we would have seen even last year or 2 years ago. And Dave mentioned that before. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Charles Grom, Deutsche Bank. 
Shane Higgins: It's Shane Higgins on for Chuck. First of all, I thought it was really interesting that you guys laid out that the nonfuel, non-pharmacy IDs, and obviously they looked pretty nice and remarkably stable. How does that compare to the growth in your markets? I know you guys have been picking up share pretty consistently. Would 2% to 3% kind of growth or how should we think about that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm not sure what you mean by growth in the markets, if you're asking about population growth and the like. But overall, it's really the result of a combination of things Dave and Rodney have already described. Dave described increased visits and increased units per visit, and Rodney has described that our tonnage was the strongest since second quarter of 2010. And it's really a combination of all those factors that has allowed us to continue to grow. We don't want to speculate on exactly where our market share is today. It's a calculation we do once a year, and we'll describe that in March when we release full year results. But it's been pretty broad-based. As Rodney said, all of the departments have had positive identical food store sales again this quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the broad-based performance. 
Shane Higgins: Yes. So I guess as inflation has moderated and you guys touched on -- so tonnage has actually been steadily improving over the past 3 quarters, has been driving more that ID sales. 
J. Schlotman: It actually has -- inflation has come in a little faster than we would have originally predicted, which was reflected in the reduction of our LIFO reserve. And the effect on the tonnage picking up, it's actually picked up a little faster than we expected. I don't want to say it's all just because there's less inflation. Certainly, a lot of it is the value equation we give to our customers, and the way we go to market every day continues to resonate with the customer. So it's a combination of factors. But bottom line, that's -- your comment is true. 
Shane Higgins: Yes. And how should we think about the inflation over the next couple of months? Are you hearing -- sorry if you guys already talked about this, but are you hearing anything from vendors in terms of prices going up, any impact from the drought? 
J. Schlotman: Well, there are certainly some of the futures out there that would indicate higher costs. Some of those, they're off their peaks when you look at the corn and soybeans and things like that. Certainly, portions of the protein complex continue to have a lot of inflation. The beef side has a lot inflation. That's offset right now by some deflation in the pork side, and the seafood right now is deflationary. So we really look at it of what item is out there that has the right price points that's going to resonate with the customer. I don't want to speculate on 2013 inflation at this point. But I think the year is playing out to end a little bit lower inflation level than we originally predicted. And there are commodities out there that are the other way; things like sugar hasn't had nearly the same effect, orange juice is below the 5-year average. So there are those categories out there that have some positive influence. 
Shane Higgins: Great. Just one last question on your ID sales you guys refer on the outlook for the year. It does imply kind of a 1% to 3% type number for the fourth quarter. And based on your earlier comments about recent trends being actually slightly better than third quarter, what -- are you guys just being conservative in kind of leaving the guidance unchanged? Is there concern about the impact of the fiscal cliff? How should we think about that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I was worried when we used the same number in the press release that it could be read that we reaffirm 3% to 3.5% as our annual number. That's actually just specific fourth quarter guidance. And we wanted to make sure people -- I didn't want to use the annual guidance because there's only 12 weeks left in the quarter, and you would have gotten a number like that. So the 3% to 3.5% we described is actually just for the fourth quarter. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky, Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: Can you give us a sense, Dave, on how the consumer behaved around the Thanksgiving buying period and how it compared to last year? 
David Dillon: We were very pleased with the Thanksgiving selling this year, thought it went quite well. And both pleased from an operational point of view and a merchandising point of view. But the customer reaction was solid and improving, just like we've been improving all year on other things. 
Charles Cerankosky: Okay. And how about the gas profitability? Up nicely year-over-year. Mike, what are sort of the dynamics around that? Is it increased traffic or less competition from fuel merchants? What's happening there? 
David Dillon: Well, you can see that the gas prices during the quarter were volatile. And anytime gas prices are volatile, you get things that change one way or the other. And this particular quarter had a bit higher margins and had even higher margins towards the end of the quarter as the gas prices came down. And in fact that helped the quarter, as you could see in the numbers, and as Mike I think described. We saw identical gallons up, so we're good, solid there. And I think that's a bit of a countertrend compared to where the industry is. And that's, we believe, because we're adding fuel stations, because we are connecting with the customers and they like having gas right at the grocery store and because of our fuel rewards program. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, ID gallons were up in both the C-store offering and in the supermarket fuel offering. And on the supermarkets, I think, should have -- I want to comment just a little bit more, only because to have the strong identical fuel gallons we've had is pretty impressive as we continue to add fuel markets to our existing stores. And that could potentially cause sister store impact from one fuel center to another. Our total gallons sold into supermarket fuel centers was up a lot more than our IDs were. But we still maintain that strong, solid ID even with the growing number of outlets for consumers to go to. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Mark Wiltamuth, Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth: It's Mark Wiltamuth, Morgan Stanley. I wanted to ask about the credit card settlement. You've got a pretty good gain there. There have been periods in the past when you've taken big windfalls and plowed it back into reinvesting into price. Is that the intention here? Or is this just separate from your overall strategy on pricing? 
J. Schlotman: Well, you got to think about this a little bit different. This settlement included a cash component, which obviously is in our financials, but also a change of the rules under which you could take the cards and deal with the cards with your customers. So on one hand, the amount that we've described and adjusted our earnings for, that went to the shareholders. But the rules change, we think there's some benefits there for our customers that can incentivize the customer to use the lower form of payment and that of course, goes to them. So we'd see it as a really big win. It's a win for the customer, it's a win for the shareholder. All around, we think it works well. So I think that's how we expect to play it out. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And then looking at your rolling 4 quarter EBIT, down 7 basis points, and you're still looking for it to be up for the year once you're finished with the fourth quarter. Is there something rolling off on fourth quarter last year that really kind of helps you get to positive? And where do you kind of stand on the 3 quarters to date so far? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm actually glad you asked that question, Mark, because we resisted the temptation to put that metric in our prepared comments because we don't like to shift how we measure ourselves. One of the things that gives us comfort with our ability to increase that for the full year, when you look at year-to-date without fuel and the 2 adjustment items, we're actually down 1 basis point year-to-date. So it's not like we have to -- from where we are at year-to-date, we only have to go up a few to get it to be positive. But the rolling 4 quarters has -- last year's third quarter actually was very strong, and that's one of the things that caused the comparison to be a little off. And that is on a 52-week basis, not a -- we're not using the extra week to cause that to be the outcome. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. So that does imply some better margin here coming up in the fourth quarter? 
J. Schlotman: It implies a little bit better. Keep in mind, it only has to go -- it only has to be 2 or 3 basis points better to get me positive for the year. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Karen Short, BMO Capital. 
Karen Short: Just to clarify on inflation for the fourth quarter. Your full year LIFO guidance implies kind of $30 million in LIFO expense for the fourth quarter. Is that -- is this quarter just a true-up, because it sounds like you're saying that you think the fourth quarter inflation is going to be similar to the third? 
J. Schlotman: Well, we reduced our annual estimate by $25 million based on what we see today. And to get the year-to-date rate, you have to take 10/13 of that reduction into this quarter, and then the fourth quarter winds up just being 3/13 of $125 million. So that's how you ought to wind up thinking about what the numbers are. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm just curious on your shrink, can you kind of maybe elaborate a little bit on what your strategy is to tackle shrink, and what you think the timing might be on seeing some improvement? 
J. Schlotman: Well, it should be a little each quarter. The detail in terms of how you accomplish it, it's all the basics. Some of it is driven by actual theft. There's all kinds of things that you work on in terms of trying to reduce the actual theft. One of the things that's constantly surprising is how much more sophisticated some of the theft rings are today than they were even 2 or 3 years ago. And it's just making sure that we put even more focus on some of those, some of it's basic operations. And that's blocking and tackling. It's nothing really very fancy. It's making sure you get deliveries into the store at the right time, i.e. take market downs appropriately and those things. So it's not fancy. Our expectation of ourselves would be to gradually improve and get it back to where we're satisfied again. 
Karen Short: How much of it is actually theft versus say... 
J. Schlotman: Well, you never know for sure. Internally, we would probably really tell you. We think it's about half and half, but that is a wild guess because you really don't know for sure. 
David Dillon: With all this conversation about shrink, I ought to at least add my own thought is that, as shrink goes, we actually are in pretty good shape. I don't want to give anybody the impression we think we have a big shrink problem. And by 2 questions like that on that could give you that impression. But we see improvement to be made. 
Karen Short: Got it. Okay. And then I guess last question is just a few years ago when you really had very, very strong tonnage growth, it was so strong it kind of became hard to manage from kind of an expense perspective. I guess I was just wondering if tonnage does continue to improve, what kind of changes you've made to prevent this from happening again or what you think your expenses are going to look like? 
David Dillon: I recall those issues were really more because of the volatile nature from one quarter to the next and what we were seeing there. And I think what we've seen now is more steady. Plus, I think we've given a lot of thought to what we went through that period, and I think we're being very intelligent about the way in which we're operating our store. Rodney, if you want to add any color... 
W. McMullen: Well, the only other thing that, when tonnage was so strong before, and this would happen in any situation, the actual work and the number of hours that we schedule on our stores is driven by the tonnage that goes through it. So at that point in time, we had almost -- I mean basic identical sales were only 1% to 2% positive, but we were growing our tonnage by 5% or 6%. So anytime you grow tonnage by that much, you're going to have more hours to actually do the physical work. 
David Dillon: Yes, I'm glad Rodney added that. Because, frankly, if I look back over the last 10 years, one of the things that I'm most proud of us doing in this company is that point, is that as you experience inflation but not have tonnage growth, we modify our hours to do the work, not to handle the dollar sales. And so as you have deflation or low periods of inflation and tonnage growth, we still have the hours in to do the work, so the customers don't end up suffering. We said all along that our Customer 1st Strategy is making sure we run our stores in a way that connects really well with customers. And in the past, we ran it with the dollars, and today, we run it with the cases. And it's a much more effective way to do it. And that's one of the reasons, because we've done it for so long now, our customers really trust us and appreciate us. 
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin, Jefferies & Company. 
Scott Mushkin: A lot of my questions have been answered, so I just want to do some housekeeping items. Did you guys actually give the tonnage number? I know you said it was the best since the second quarter of '10 or something like that. But did you give the actual number? 
J. Schlotman: We did not. 
Scott Mushkin: Do you want to? 
J. Schlotman: I'll defer to Rodney and Dave. 
W. McMullen: Scott, I don't think it's helpful to do that. We're happy with it. In prior quarters, we described it as marginally positive, and we're happier with it than that. It was a very strong quarter for tonnage. 
David Dillon: And actually, the reason we don't want to give it is that it doesn't have the kind of precision that giving a number might imply it would have. And because it doesn't, we're trying to make a rational judgment as to what the number really says, and we're interpreting it and telling you what that number says. We try to do that really with this whole call as our objective here is to let you see this business through our eyes and give you the weight of what we think is actually happening. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, if you just want to get a rough calculation, Scott, just take our identical sales less the inflation estimate we provided. I mean it's not exactly right, but it's roughly close. 
David Dillon: And certainly directionally correct, true. 
Scott Mushkin: So that goes back to kind of a second housekeeping item. I know you guys answered this a little bit. But it seems to me that the delta, your volume delta between you and the industry, or the delta volume between you and the industry, better way to say it, has been widening out, which is very suggestive of share gains accelerating. Yet you didn't want to commit to that on the call, and I'm kind of a little surprised about that. I don't know if you have any further comments on that. 
David Dillon: I think we're quite clear that we believe we've picked up share. We just don't think it's been dramatic or sudden. We think it's been gradual over time. And it does -- what you just said does help describe what we think is happening in the industry overall where people buy food. The industry has widened to places not just supermarkets. So you've seen a lot of the mass operators and the dollar stores and the drugstores and club stores, all those places sell food, and so now the market is a much wider market. But the winners and losers in that market, it's always been true in food retailing. There's people who are being more successful than others. And a lot of the success today comes, a few of the public companies are ones that are outside of the supermarket industry, except for Kroger. You add Kroger into that mix. And then you have some private companies, and you don't see their numbers. But we happen to know that those private companies, based on what we see in the markets, that they have been improving too. So we think that we are separating ourselves from many in the industry. We are among the winners in the industry, and we think that there are other winners in the industry as well. 
W. McMullen: The only thing, Dave, I would add -- and Scott, as you know, we really focus more on market share on an annual basis rather than quarter-to-quarter. We're certainly pleased with where we think we are. But really, once a year is when we step back and really dig into the numbers in a very detailed way. So to answer the question, it isn't so much we're trying to avoid it. It's just that during the year, we wouldn't focus as much energy on trying to understand it, as long as directionally the numbers look like they're tracking in a good way. 
Scott Mushkin: All right. Perfect. I have 2 more quick ones, I'll just roll them together. So really excited about the ROIC focus, as I think you guys know. But I was hoping for an update on when we can see ROIC as part of the long-term executive incentive plan. I think Dave indicated at the analyst day that, that change would likely be forthcoming. And then the second housekeeping item is x fuel EBIT dollars, were they up or not? So those 2, and then I'll yield. 
J. Schlotman: On the first one, yes, x fuel EBIT operating profit dollars, just so I'm talking to my terms versus how you may calculate it, x fuel operating profit dollars were up in the quarter, yes. 
David Dillon: And then to your question about ROIC and the long-term incentive plan, we actually have a board meeting next week with our comp committee. And one of the areas that we plan to explore with them and to suggest to them is to add a component along those lines. But it's our comp committee that makes that decision ultimately and -- so stay tuned. But it's not going to happen instantly. You'll probably hear -- be able to hear about it on the next call. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Wolf, BB&T. 
Andrew Wolf: I wanted to ask you on the turnaround or the turn-up in the unit count. Using dunnhumby and other ways to look at it, can you kind of differentiate between how much of that is kind of sold on promotion? I think last quarter, you'd mentioned you were sending out more direct mail coupons to increase penetrations or in categories with certain customers. So much is sort of on promotion and maybe something that maybe only Kroger can pull off versus how much of it is maybe the environment? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the mix, the growth is pretty balanced between everyday-type items and promotional-type items. So we felt really good about it because a lot of the growth is from new customers, and those are more sustainable. So a nice balance between the 2, and it really didn't change versus earlier in the year. 
Andrew Wolf: That's exactly what I was getting at. And my housekeeping question is on the extra week. I think you indicated you can't tell us what that might affect EPS and earnings for until -- or did you already say what it is and I missed that? And what I'm getting at is if I'm trying to adjust EBITDA to a calendarized basis, let's say -- or EBIT, FIFO EBIT, can I just straight-line it? Or are there some expenses that are treated where you get a benefit because it doesn't have the extra week? 
J. Schlotman: You cannot straight-line it. This isn't the first time we've had a 53rd week year, and we've always described what the effect of that is and what items you cannot straight line. So that's out there historically. The only reason -- certainly, we have an estimate internally of what we think the benefit of that extra week will be. At the end of the day, it'll be driven by how many sales dollars fall into that week. It will be one of those weeks that falls in, crossing the calendar into the first of the month, has a couple fewer days at the first of the month than the prior year's week it's going to be comparing to add. So that's the only reason we've had any hesitancy about saying exactly what that benefit is going to be. We have a good feel for it. But we'll let you know when we see exactly where sales were and when we release full year numbers in March. 
Andrew Wolf: And my last question, actually I want to get to digital marketing, because I think Dave mentioned that in his preamble. And just looking at the website, corporate website, to me, at least, it looks like a complete makeover into a really digital-driven platform. And so my questions are twofold. First, is it too early to -- if I'm right, is it too early to -- or do you have any sort of preliminary information on what that's doing for the business? And secondly, just overall, where do you see digital marketing going? I mean some folks think it's going to slowly or maybe even rapidly, replace print media for distributing coupons on a mass basis and so forth. 
David Dillon: Andy, I'm so glad you noticed, because that's true. We've done a lot of work on our website, and we continue to do updates to our app that's available too for mobile devices. And we're very excited about that. And I think what we've seen is that gradual interest by our customers in connecting with us both in the traditional ways, that really has continued to be strong, but also in digital ways. And the more we have improved, the more we see those customers engaged. So we're seeing a gradual improvement there. It's not some sudden improvement. And in terms of the business, we certainly are getting a lot of digital coupons that we take as an example. That number is quite high. And so we see a lot of activity. But it's hard really to measure the specific results that would be derived from digital marketing versus the specific results in traditional marketing. We see it as blended together, and we see that the customer who responds to one also responds to the other. You have some people who are just digital and others who are just traditional, but many people fall into the camp of both. And so it's really hard to read what caused their activity and what caused their emotion. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? I think that would be it, Andy. What else? 
Andrew Wolf: Just one follow-up. Just on the development side, some companies I follow have gone outside the company to folks who have been doing digital marketing, maybe for longer in other industries, some have done it internally. Could you comment on how the development in terms of personnel has been? 
W. McMullen: Yes, it's a good question. We actually have a mix of both, and the team is probably about half and half. And if you look at who's helping us, we're partnering with several different outside companies. So -- and right now, we like the balance because we think it's the best of both. Obviously, dunnhumby is helping us with that as well. 
Operator: Your final question is coming from the line of Stephen Grambling, Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: My question actually looks out towards actually 2014 with changes to the broader health care and policy there. I'm wondering if you can maybe talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact from those changes, how you might be trying to mitigate those costs going forward? 
David Dillon: Well, there's a lot of dimensions to the health care costs. But I would start with first, which is we believe very strongly that our associates need good health care and that we want, whatever plan we do, to give them a health care program that we can be proud of. And we think we've consistently done that for many years. And so I don't really see what we'll be doing in the next couple of years as radically different than what we've been doing in the last several, and that is looking for ways in which we can improve the way in which we handle health care. The biggest change in health care over the last 3 or 4 or 5 years has been instead of trying to cost shift, that is move the cost from an employer to the associate, we've tried to find ways to actually reduce the overall cost. So that if the associate pays say a 70% or so of the health care cost, just as an example, if they pay that -- or 30% rather and the company pays 70%, as an example, if we're in that situation and we can reduce the overall cost of the health care, the associate can save and we can save. And it tends to flatten the increased cost that you might otherwise experience. Now with the new health care law taking effect, that certainly changes some of those dimensions, and it will increase some of our costs and will increase some of our associates' costs. But the overall objective still remains. Rodney, you want to add anything? 
W. McMullen: Yes, just one small addition and Dave briefly mentioned it. I mean we really are focused on trying to help our associates have a healthier lifestyle and doing things to help support them. And we invest a lot of dollars for our associates to get preventive-type care or physicals, those kind of things because we really want our associates to be able to be the healthiest they can be. And that will help lower everybody's cost, but it'll also help our associates have a better lifestyle. 
David Dillon: Before we end the call, though, I do want to share some additional thoughts, particularly with the associates that are listening. We appreciate everybody sticking with us today, given the technical difficulties at the beginning.
 I have 2 special messages for our associates today. First is we take time to honor our veterans this month in November, and I'm pleased that we support our veterans and military families in so many ways at Kroger. And want I want to thank you for your support in launching, honoring our heroes, our company-wide partnership with the USO. Since 2010, Kroger has raised more than $5 million to assist service members and their families. This has been because of you, our customers and our vendor partners. Your generous support helps fund the USO's variety of programs that benefit our troops and their families.
 In addition, Kroger announced Hiring Our Heroes, a renewed commitment to hiring veterans. More than 17,000 veterans have joined Kroger's ranks since 2009. By the end of this year, our human resource team will attend 15 military -- recruit military veterans career fairs, and they plan to attend even more in 2013. As always, we are pleased to welcome veterans to our Kroger family, and we continue to support our active duty military associates who work for us.
 My other message for associates is about this holiday season. Because of you, Kroger is the trusted and preferred store for millions of families at this special time of the year. Your enthusiasm and creativity clearly show us -- clearly shows as we visit our stores across the country, and we appreciate everything you do to delight our customers and keep our stores running smoothly. Today, our busy shoppers have more retail choices than ever before. Offering to help somebody find something, keeping items in stock on the shelves, making checkout fast and easy, these are all ways that you can make their day a little more pleasant. So thank you for the hard work during this holiday season.
 And while this completes our call today, thank you, everybody, for joining us. To all of you, Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your families. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2012-09-07 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Janeda, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Janeda. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]
 On behalf of all of us at Kroger, we thank many of you for participating in our June survey. We strive to be exceptional listeners at Kroger, whether listening to our customers, our associates or our shareholders. We appreciated your time and honest assessments. We are also hopeful that you can join us for our 2012 investor conference on October 16 in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you next month for this important session with Kroger leadership. 
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
 I am pleased with Kroger's strong performance in the second quarter. Kroger's shareholders once again benefited from our Customer 1st strategy. Increased customer loyalty and solid cost controls allowed us to grow sales, profitability and shareholder value. 
 In the second quarter, we reported record second quarter earnings per share. We increased identical supermarket sales for the 35th consecutive quarter. We increased identical sales in every operating division and every store department. We grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. We increased FIFO operating profit by $47 million. We increased tonnage over last year. And we put Kroger's strong free cash flow to work for shareholders by repurchasing 23.7 million shares. 
 Based on the strength of our second quarter results and the higher-than-anticipated share repurchase activity, we have raised our earnings per share guidance for the year and expect to achieve toward the upper end of our identical supermarket sales growth and earnings per share guidance. Mike will have more to say on our guidance in a few minutes. 
 Our associates controlled costs and improved productivity in the second quarter, saving money in places not important to customers so we can reinvest in places that are. We target investments in the 4 keys of our strategy, people, products, shopping experience and price to increase relevance with our customers. Greater relevance inspires customer loyalty and grows both sales and profit as our second quarter results demonstrated. This is what makes Kroger unique among food retailers, our unrelenting focus on solving our customers' needs. That we've achieved consistent ID sales growth demonstrates that our strategy resonates with customers and our increased earnings guidance demonstrates how this creates shareholder value. 
 Rodney will now discuss Kroger's positive business trends in the second quarter. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter as OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel were down 59 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis and excluding one-time items, we have had 7 consecutive years of reductions in this metric. And our year-to-date results set us up to achieve our eighth consecutive year. 
 We do this consistently through a determined emphasis on productivity improvements. For example, we've gained efficiencies in our 1,948 pharmacy locations by utilizing new technology that helps our pharmacists to better manage workflow, prioritize prescriptions and allocate work between pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. The increased productivity reduces customer wait times and provides an enhanced pharmacy experience. 
 One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the second quarter, our loyal household count grew at a faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We also achieved positive identical sales for both total households and loyal households. Identical sales growth among loyal households was stronger than total household result. Customers continue to visit our stores more frequently, purchase fewer items on each trip and buy more on a monthly basis. This is consistent with what we've seen for the last several quarters. 
 We're very pleased with the improvement in our tonnage trend for the quarter as total units sold were up compared to last year. I'll just repeat that. Our total units, our tonnage, was up compared to last year. This is an example of how we continue to gain market share in the overall food retailing industry by focusing on our customers. The rate of product cost inflation in the second quarter continued to flatten faster than originally anticipated. Identical supermarket sales growth exceeded the rate of inflation, which we estimate was 2.2%, excluding fuel. Every store department had inflation with the exception of produce and seafood, which were deflationary. 
 Our market share gains are a result of our investments in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy. People often talk about investments we make in price, but there are many ways we have invested in our nonprice keys, people, products and shopping experience, to strengthen our connection with customers in our stores. For example, over the last several years, we've set out to improve the shopping experience by reducing customer wait time at checkout. Customers have told us they do not like waiting in long lines. Based on that feedback, we developed a solution that has reduced the average amount of time a customer waits in line to check out to about 30 seconds today compared to around 4 minutes in the past. Our customers tell us they noticed the difference, and we are delivering a shopping experience that makes them want to return. 
 Our people and products keys are equally important. We want our customers to say our associates provide helpful, friendly service, that they can always get the products they want plus a little at our stores. A great example of how we are strengthening these 2 keys is through our partnership with Murray's Cheese. Our stores are home to about 51 specialty Murray's Cheese shops. In these locations, we provide associates with the opportunity, training and tools to become certified Murray's Cheese master, associates like Jimmy Mraz [ph] from King Soopers store 33 in Boulder. He participated in an in-depth, 5-week training program that includes a basic skills class, certification and an orientation at the original Murray's Cheese shop in New York City. Jimmy [ph] returned to his Murray's Cheese shop with new skills, a passion for sharing knowledge with our customers and the distinct red jacket that signifies his status as a cheese master. Customers love the extra service and product expertise, not to mention the incredibly selection of delicious cheeses, of which I've tried many of. As a result of these efforts, our customers tell us that our associates are doing an increasingly good job of providing services. That is why we consider our nonprice investments to be as central to Kroger's strategy as the price investments. 
 If you look at nearly any food retailer who is succeeding right now, including the regional players, they are doing something unique that resonates with customers. We know from our 35 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales and consistent market share growth that our focus on all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy is driving loyalty, which creates value for shareholders. 
 In the second quarter, Kroger's corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of grocery department sales dollars. Grocery department corporate brand units sold were 33.5% compared to the same quarter last year. These results continue to show improvement since the economic downturn began. The mix between national brands and corporate brands fluctuates in any given quarter, but corporate brands continue to gain share over time. We continue to offer our customers choices and variety and value to meet their needs. To complement the assortment of national brand single-serve coffee products we offer, beginning next week, we're launching our new line of Private Selection single-serve coffee pods. The new line is compatible with Keurig coffee machines and will include a variety of 100% Arabica roasts and blends, including breakfast blend, Guatemala, Swiss Water, decaf and Venetian Reserve. 
 Yogurt is another popular and high-growth category with great potential. Kroger's self-manufactures most of our yogurt selection. We recently added 15 new varieties, including new flavors such as Blueberry Pomegranate, Caramel Spice Cake and Vanilla Bean. For toddlers, our new comfort yogurt bites [ph] are great and full of vitamins A, C and E. And I can tell you on the new yogurt flavors, they taste great, and I've tried over half of them already. 
 I'm happy to share that Kroger continues to advance sustainability initiatives. We released our sixth annual Sustainability Report earlier this week, and I'd like to share a few highlights. We are using significantly less energy today than we were just 12 years ago. In fact, we've reduced our overall energy consumption in our stores by more than 31% since the year 2000. 19 of Kroger's manufacturing plants sent 0 waste to landfills in 2011. And Kroger increased fleet efficiency by more than 9% in the past year and by more than 25% since 2008. These are just a few examples of how we're working to make sure the world is a better place. We are very proud of our progress and our associates' hard work to make these results positive -- possible. 
 Finally, an update on labor relations. Associates in Louisville and Dayton both ratified labor agreements. We continue negotiations on many contracts, including in Arizona, Columbus, Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville and Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages, a quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. 
 Next, Mike will share additional detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and guidance for 2012. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our identical supermarket sales increased 3.6% in the second quarter, which contributed to net earnings totaling $279.1 million compared to $280.8 million in the same period last year. Net earnings per diluted share showed strong growth to $0.51 from $0.46 per diluted share last year. Prior year net earnings benefited from a 27.6% tax rate compared to a tax rate of 34.5% in the second quarter this year. 
 Our earnings per share growth was driven by strong performance in sales and EBITDA and higher-than-anticipated share repurchase activity. FIFO EBITDA was up $56 million for the quarter or $55 million excluding fuel. FIFO gross margin was 20.63% of sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, the FIFO gross margin decreased 43 basis points from the same period last year. 
 Kroger recorded a $34.7 million LIFO charge in the second quarters of both 2012 and 2011. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation were 18.01% of sales. Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A plus rent and depreciation declined 59 basis points as a percent of sales. And as Rodney said, we accomplished this for the last 7 years. And based on our first half results, we expect to achieve our eighth year. Identifying and delivering sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy consistently over time. 
 Second quarter FIFO operating margin dollars increased $47 million, both with and without fuel. Excluding fuel on a rolling 4 quarters basis, the company's operating margin rate was 3 basis points lower compared to last year. This is an 8-point improvement in the trend from the first quarter. We expect that slightly increasing FIFO operating margin excluding fuel for the full fiscal year. 
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. Our supermarket fuel centers and convenience stores produced positive identical gallon growth for the quarter. These outlets earned approximately $0.164 per gallon compared to $0.174 in the same quarter last year. The benefit to second quarter earnings per share was the same as last year. 
 Now I'll update you on our financial strategy. During fiscal 2012, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain its current debt rating. During the quarter, we purchased 23.7 million common shares for a total investment of $525 million. There is approximately $476 million currently remaining of the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized on June 14, 2012. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used its strong free cash flow to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. 
 Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $447.7 million for the quarter compared with $428.5 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range. 
 Net total debt was $8.1 billion for the second quarter, an increase of $1.2 billion from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.96 compared to 1.71 during the same period last year. Our objective is to maintain a net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.00. We took advantage of what we believe to be an undervalued stock price in the second quarter to buy back shares. 
 Our experience through the first half of this year is that the external environment has been a little better than in 2011. We continue to monitor changes in gas prices and inflation. And as the headlines continually remind us, macroeconomic issues will continue to affect consumer sentiment throughout the year. We are confident in our ability to make tactical adjustments as needed to successfully navigate these factors while continuing to deliver on our Customer 1st strategy. 
 As a result of strong first half performance and higher-than-anticipated share repurchase activity, Kroger is increasing its fiscal 2012 earnings guidance to a range of $2.35 to $2.42 per diluted share. The company continues to expect identical supermarket sales growth for the full year, excluding fuel, of 3% to 3.5%. Kroger expects to achieve in the upper end of the range for both earnings per share and sales growth. The previous earnings per share guidance was a range of $2.33 to $2.40. We continue to expect the growth rate in the third and fourth quarters will be higher than our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8%, and the fourth quarter will also benefit from the 53rd week. Now I'll return it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Mike, thank you. There's no doubt that Kroger has a bright future because of our growing connection with our customers. Since we've changed how we managed our business about 8 years ago, we have seen significant success. Every day, our associates are delivering better shopping experience for our customers and our customers continue to reward us with their loyalty. 
 Kroger's increased earnings per share guidance for the year reflects our confidence that our Customer 1st strategy will continue to create value for our customers and shareholders alike. Of course, an ever-changing environment requires vigilance and constant evaluation. And with that in mind, we hope that you'll join us for an important discussion of our plans for continued success at the upcoming October investor conference in New York. 
 So now we look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. 
Deborah Weinswig: Can you just help us understand the growth in tonnage this quarter maybe versus the past 3? It sounds like it's improving in terms of overall growth. But maybe just help us understand the actual numbers. 
David Dillon: Well, the tonnage trend and growth has increased because as we said in the last 2 quarters, I believe, we were essentially flat, and now we're seeing actual growth. We did see a little bit more growth in national brands than we did Kroger brands, but we saw growth overall. And that's probably the extent of the color. Rodney, you want to add anything? 
W. McMullen: I'll just say it's very broad-based. Most categories had growth. And it's really been driven by the increased loyalty from the customers with the household count flowing through to buy in more products. That's what's really driving it. 
Deborah Weinswig: Can you point to anything specifically that you're doing? Or what do you think at this point in the game is driving it? 
W. McMullen: Well, I think it's multiple things. I think the lower inflation rate is certainly helping some. Certainly, if you look at some of our work with dunnhumby and targeted mailings, there's certain segments we weren't satisfied with the result we were getting. And we've worked real hard on making some targeted offers for those customers, and they're rewarding us with increased purchases. So it's really both of those pieces together, and then just an overall improvement in household count shopping with us. 
Deborah Weinswig: When did the queuing initiative start? And how have you been communicating that to existing customers and maybe nonexisting customers? 
W. McMullen: It really started probably about 3, 3.5 years ago in terms of learning how to do it. It involves a tremendous amount of work with our associates and technology behind the scenes to support our associates. So it's really both working together. It probably took a year or so to get to where all of that was working together, and then it took a couple of years to get it rolled out across the company. The way we communicate it to our customers is really letting our associates in the advertising tell -- our associates tell our customers what they're doing for them. 
Deborah Weinswig: Because I would say as somebody, myself, who's in your stores a lot, I mean, now you go in and you're like, "Where is everyone?" And when you get to the front of the line, it's just that they're getting to your line so quickly. I mean, that's the experience. And so I just wondered if you thought that was having any impact on the tonnage as well. 
W. McMullen: Certainly, it has to help some because the customer realizes they can come to Kroger and get out really fast, so it has to help. 
David Dillon: Everything we're doing, Deb, is designed to cause customers to want to shop with us more of their shopping trip. And this is certainly one really good example. But there's, of course, lots of other things we're doing. But all of those contribute to that trend. 
Deborah Weinswig: All right. One last question out there. Any plans with regards to bringing your corporate brands available to consumers outside of where you have stores through e-commerce? I was just thinking about how great that coffee pod sounded. 
W. McMullen: At this point, not directly now. From using a website, I would expect sometime in not the forever future that you'll see that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So 2 things. One, if you think about the expense opportunity, I assume the bulk of it is going to be in the store right where the bulk of the costs are, where do you think there's still a large opportunity to take some costs down? You've done some work at the front end. But if you think about backroom, if you think about just some of the perishable departments, maybe grocery, if you do think about it a little more like that, where do you think the 1 or 2 biggest opportunities are to continue to take labor out? 
David Dillon: Well, it won't surprise you, John, that we won't identify the specific things going out there. But I will identify a couple of observations. First, the best way to save in our kind of business is in lots of different ways. They can be multiplied by the number of stores and by our volume. And by the way, it's definitely not all focused on just taking labor hours out. In fact, more of what we're trying to do is find ways to reduce the labor required for some tasks that don't matter to the customer, and then spend those same labor hours on things that do matter to the customer, like getting them through the front end quicker. So it's not so much -- in fact, we've grown number of employees this year. We've end up growing hours in our stores. All of that is on the upswing. So really what we're trying to do is be more effective in the tasks that just simply don't matter and apply the resources in places that actually do. We see plenty of opportunities out there, not all of them have to do with things that people do. A lot of them have to do with things that are not involving labor. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Well, if you look at the sustainability that we talked about, obviously, for the environment, it's a tremendous improvement in sustainability and helping make the world a better place. But it also saves a lot in cost because if you think about the 19 plants that have 0 waste to landfill, well, we're not taking stuff to landfill so that cost is no longer there. So it's not just labor in the stores where we're able to find costs, and we have a long list of opportunities. And it's really prioritizing in terms of how many can you do at a time. 
John Heinbockel: Because I think -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I would think just on a kind of normalized basis, normal cost inflation in your cost items, you'd be 2% to 3%. So I guess, the question is, because you've done a much better job the last couple of years, can 1 to 2 -- can you grow -- and then some of this will depend on the comp. But if 2% to 3% is the right number on an ongoing basis, should O&A grow lower than that as you take some of these costs out? Or was that too optimistic? 
W. McMullen: Well, you'll see us work awfully hard not to have a 2% to 3% base inflation. And we do an awful lot of partnering with our suppliers and vendors to try to understand how can we work together to take cost out of the system, both for them and for us. So as of right now, I wouldn't -- you shouldn't assume that we'll have a 2% to 3% cost increase. 
John Heinbockel: All right. Then just finally, just describe where do you think the M&A environment is right now? I know you want to do more in-store or in-market transactions if you can. But where's the environment? And is there any appetite for entirely new markets or not really, in the economic environment we're in today? 
David Dillon: I feel like I ought to just pull out the script from speech number 47 because the same thing we've said for many quarters in a row is still true today is that we look at lots of stuff. We find that end-market things seem to be more successful and appealing to us. Big things are things we're going to be very selective about, and that we don't comment on anything that we're taking a look at. Now you just need to recognize that we are regularly looking at things that are out there. I don't really see the environment any different and I don't see our strategy or plans any different than they have been for the last several quarters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank. 
Charles Grom: Dave, just wondering if you could share with us how the ID trended during the quarter. And if you could, how quarter to date trends are looking so far. 
David Dillon: Let's see, if I remember correctly -- I'm looking for confirmation -- but I think it was gently down through the quarter. And some of that though, you should recognize and it's what I'll also say about current quarter is that one of the big effects this year has been the switch to generic from national brand on some of the prescription items. And in prescriptions of pharmacy particularly that has a huge dollar impact. So that swing drives not only pharmacy, but it's big enough actually to show up in our numbers. So that could actually be part of what we saw in the trend in the quarter. If you look at the current quarter to date, so far we are slightly down from where we were last quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into that for these kinds of reasons. One was the example I gave before is we do see the pharmacy generic shift gaining steam as the year goes by, and actually, every week it does. We see volatility between weeks, which is what we described last quarter. That volatility is driven this year a little bit more than normal at the end of the month because of the 2-day shift with having an extra day in February. That 2-day shift makes it more pronounced. This last month end was quite similar to the things we've experienced earlier in the year. But it does cause those volatile shifts. And then finally, we see electronic benefits in some states as shifting to smooth the way in which those benefits are paid out to the community at large and no longer headed up just to the person above. So that tends to smooth it out a bit and give us that variability. So that's maybe a picture for you to understand where we are so far. 
Charles Grom: Okay. And there has been a lot of chatter throughout the past couple of months on the competitive landscape and just wondering if you could give us your sense of things. 
David Dillon: Competitive landscape is what it always is in our business. It's always changing in where the aggressiveness is coming from and in what markets it's in. But it certainly is competitive just like it has been for a long time. You've read and seen a lot of noise about some competitors who have been out there, and certainly that's true. But there are other competitors who maybe are a little less aggressive than they were. And like I said, there's just always a change over time, but it's always going to be competitive. And that's the way it is right now. 
Charles Grom: Okay. Fair enough. And then one for Mike. Just any thoughts on the dividend yields only around 2%, pretty low relative to many of your peers and other CPG companies. Any thoughts on raising that down the road? 
J. Schlotman: We regularly talk about the dividend with our Board of Directors, and our stated policy has been that this is -- we only have been paying a dividend for 6 years, and we've continued to grow it over time. And we would expect to continue to grow our dividend over time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: Question about generics, which you mentioned is having a negative impact on sales. Obviously, it should be having a positive impact on gross margin. First, I'd like to confirm that, that's true. 
David Dillon: That's definitely true. Now we're talking about pharmacy. And that is absolutely true. 
Meredith Adler: I was just wondering how you look at that. It's obviously not going to continue forever. It didn't happen as much last year. Do you see that as a windfall and that you are happy to spend that extra gross margin to the extent that there was a lot of it in better pricing or some other investment, 1 of your 4 keys? 
David Dillon: We wouldn't be as specific only looking at one item. We would be looking at everything together along with what cost reductions we feel like we can achieve. And then working with dunnhumby, we would look at where's the most effective use of improving our pricing position for our customers. So it's part of helping out in terms of what dollars we would have to invest. But it's not specifically oriented just to that one item. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. Great. And then just a question on your labor negotiations. I just was wondering if you could kind of talk about kind of the tone of the negotiations, where the focus is. Are there particular concerns in particular markets about health care, pension? And some of the contracts you mentioned that you're still negotiating, have any of those gone beyond their contract expiration? 
David Dillon: I'll let Rodney comment on any specifics he wants to add. But let me just tell you generally that our working relationship with the unions generally continues to be good, and it's something that we're committed to making sure that we have that good working relationship. And I think a lot of that is driven by the fact that as a company, our objective is to be balanced in what we end up with in our agreements. We're not out to just cut costs and cut expenses. Our objective is to make sure our employees, our associates, end up with a really good compensation package and we end up with a cost structure that makes us competitive. And that continues to be true. Now in individual contracts, of course, those end up being negotiations with the local presidents. And often those will end up individually being different than maybe that overall trend. And it's really up to whatever those local situations are. Sometimes there are particular issues in the contract that are problematic. Now overall, if you look at pension and health care, those have, for many years and continue for many more years, to be a focus of attention because that's where a lot of the growth of expense is. And in some of those parts, it's where some of our uncompetitive expenses are. So we've paid a lot of attention in the negotiations. So Rodney, you want to add any color to that? 
W. McMullen: Just a couple of small comments. Many of the contracts are passed expiration. The thing that all of us have been very pleased with is our associates, the union and us just trying to make sure that we work through the issues on a constructive basis. And the dialogue and discussion has been very constructive. Obviously, with health care and the changes going on there, a lot of discussion in terms of how to do it right. One other point that I would just remind everyone, if you remember the pension for most of the east part of the U.S. has been already negotiated because of the agreement that we did last year, where 4 of the major plans came in and we are now managing those plans. And as part of that change, there was a 10-year agreement on the pension part of those plans. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Of the 6 contracts that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 4 of those, Columbus, Indianapolis, Memphis and Nashville, those 4 locations have the pension benefits solved for the next 10 years. 
Meredith Adler: Well, that's great. That's very helpful. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: Could I just start off with the gross margin. The FIFO gross margin x fuel this quarter, down 43 basis points, is probably a bit more than I expected it would be because your comparison is easier. Could you maybe just talk about how that line item played out throughout the quarter and what influence, for instance, the cost savings you got this quarter, went into that or promotional environment or just initiatives that drive tonnage and how we should be thinking about that in the second half? 
David Dillon: Well, I wouldn't suggest in the numbers that there is anything particularly unusual or erratic in terms of the merchandising plans or anything. Maybe one thing that does stand out is that we had less success and strength than we have had in the previous year. And that will tend to hurt the gross margin and make it look like there was a greater investment than there actually was. That was -- and that was true in the quarter, something we're focused on. So that may be important to call out. Rodney or Mike, anything else you want to add? 
J. Schlotman: The other thing to keep in mind at, as you know, we try to manage the company on what operating profit margin is, not just gross. And while you're right, the FIFO gross margin without fuel was down 43 basis points, the operating costs were down 59 basis points. So we actually had a nice expansion in operating profit during the quarter, which are the dollars that we actually have to take to the bottom line. 
David Dillon: Yes. That is something we look at a lot more closely than just in isolation what the gross margin was. 
Edward Kelly: Yes. I understand. And then just maybe related to SG&A then. And John, I think, kind of asked this question a little but your SG&A growth this quarter in dollars was only 1.3%. And if I go back and average the last 5 years or so, right, that number is more like 4%. So the question is, is there anything unusual on this quarter, number one? And then second, as we think about that line item going forward, should we be thinking about a lower run rate than what you've had historically? 
David Dillon: Well, I'll let Mike talk if there's any specifics that he had to call out. But before he does, well, I like the way in which you characterized it, as look at the growth of the dollars in our OG&A and we look at really OG&A and rent and depreciation together. But as you look at those dollars growing -- but the only basis that, that metric, that percentage has any value at all is to look at it in the context of how much did the sales grow and how much did the gross profit dollars grow. Because if you don't do that, if you had a high sales growth period of time, we have a lot of variable expenses. And so that will tend to create a higher growth in expenses and make it look like we have expense issues when, in fact, all we had was really good sales. Well, our sales growth these last several years, we've had some higher quarters in sales growth than what we had just these last couple of quarters. And that will drive some of it. Mike, you want to add any color to the specifics? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. There's always lots of things going on in the SG&A line. And obviously, inside any 12-week quarter, lots of things can drive it. I will keep in -- I want to remind everybody to keep in mind going back to the pension benefit we talked about a second ago, when we consolidated those 4 plans, we took that charge in the fourth quarter of last year for over $900 million, and we increased our guidance this year because of the benefit of the reduction on an annual basis that, that was going to give us during this year. Now as we start to lap future years, that comparison goes away. So we are benefiting this year from lower pension expense for those 14 contracts and 4 different plans that were consolidated into one. But that was baked into our guidance. And if you go back and see what we talked about on guidance, we actually promised more than our normal growth rate because of that benefit because we made you eat the charge last year, so we have to give you the benefit back this year. Otherwise, it wasn't a smart thing to do for shareholders. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And then just last question for you. With the resolution of the Walgreens and Express Scripts dispute, can you maybe talk about the benefit that you saw there this year and what plans you have in order to try to retain or keep that business? 
David Dillon: I'll let Rodney comment on the plans we have there because obviously, that's been an important trend for our pharmacy business. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Yes. Obviously, I won't go into the specifics because starting September 15, it will start playing out, and we won't want to share what our plans are before September 15 and the customers see it. The one thing that you should know is that we have done a lot of research to make sure that we understand those customers, what they like about Kroger, what they liked about Walgreens. And we've aggressively worked on trying to make sure the things that those customers liked better about Walgreens, we've changed that. The thing that they incredibly overwhelmingly told us they liked was the one-stop, the value, the pricing that we offer and those things, customers are really satisfied with where we are there, which we think will really help on the stickiness for those customers. But we're working really hard. Our pharmacy teams from the store to the folks in the divisions and general office are working really hard to make sure they have a good plan to retain that customer. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital. 
Karen Short: Just going back to generics for a second. I know you've given us directional comments on the third and fourth quarter in terms of how generics will impact your ID. I guess, I just was wondering, it sounds like that there will be a greater impact in the fourth quarter than there will be in the third. So can you just talk about that? And then was there actually an impact this quarter? And can you quantify it? 
J. Schlotman: Well, as we've said all along with our guidance, we expect the effect of the generics to grow over time. And a lot of it was going to be back end-weighted. We talked when we gave guidance that it could be as much as a 40 to 50 basis point effect on idents for the year. And again, that could be back end-weighted. So clearly, it could be higher in the year. I will tell you that the annual -- or the weekly effect of the generics on top line sales is a little over double, almost triple on a weekly basis in terms of dollar sales now as it was earlier in the year. So it is growing just as we expect it. But again, as Meredith's question, we continue to see strong gross margin out of those. And that 0.5% is on total identicals for the company, not just pharmacy identicals. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then actually, following on that then in terms of generics, can you maybe quantify how much the benefit of the generic shift will be on gross margins, how much it was this quarter and how much it might be in the back half? 
J. Schlotman: I don't think we want to get that granular on the pharmacy business. We believe we've baked into our guidance and expectations for the year both the drag on the top line and what that will do to the leverage in the income statement as well as the better gross profit rate from those as we go throughout the year. To get that specific on any one department gets really, really difficult because there's all kinds of things that go on inside of a quarter in a particular department. 
David Dillon: I would add that don't overestimate that effect. It certainly is positive, clearly positive for the pharmacy. But the dollars themselves are not significant enough to move the total company numbers much. Not like what happens with the sales. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then on your square footage growth, I know you commented earlier this summer at a conference that you might look to accelerate unit growth. And you have kind of raised your guidance just a little bit this year. What kind of unit growth might we think of for next year? Or how do you think about that? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. It's a little too early to get into what I think we may have as far as unit growth this year. The new relocated and expanded stores we're doing, it is a little more than last year. The remodels are about the same. One of the things that's driving that is it looks like we may have a few fewer operational closings this year. And our mid-year look at our store count, it would project us to be up slightly at year end on store count. And if you look at the square footage, our guidance in the 8-K, we said we expect square footage, excluding operational closings and any acquisitions, to be up about 1.5%. So we continue to invest those dollars to grow our core business, while on the other hand spending some time cleaning up things that aren't producing a satisfactory return. We've done that, we haven't had any one-time charges for those. As we've closed those stores, they've just flown through normal operations. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company. 
Brian Cullinane: Cullinane in for Scott. Some of this has been touched on, but kind of wanted to look at uses of cash as a whole and how you think it's best to maintain or build your business in your core or adjacent markets. You've been buying back a lot of shares, and maybe -- clearly if confidence is high in the business you could increase the dividend or also use the cash to solidify market positions in places like Southern California or add new stores into adjacent markets. Can you give us some flavor on your thoughts on current uses for cash and your priorities, given the current climate? 
J. Schlotman: Well, I think right now we're fairly balanced in how we plan to use our free cash flow. And keep in mind, it's not necessarily just free cash flow. I'll remind you that our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at 1.96 now, it was 1.71 last year. So we've actually increased our debt level as well to the debt level we feel comfortable at maintaining. And I think we've done a very balanced approach between paying a dividend, which we've increased every year since we've had one. We've been very active in repurchasing shares when we think there's significant weakness in the stock, which we've demonstrated so far this year. And we continue to expect to spend $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion on capital this year. So I think we've had a very disciplined and very balanced approach to how we spend our capital and try to reward all constituents, whether it's building new stores to create new jobs, paying a dividend and buying in shares to reward shareholders, but also making sure that our debt and leverage ratios are appropriate for our bondholders. 
Brian Cullinane: Okay. Appreciate it. And then just wanted to touch on some competitive openings. Walmart has stated they're going to open a number of new stores over the next few quarters and hinted at the possibility of kind of accelerating their small-box openings. How do you view if there's a lot more small-box openings to come online next year? And secondly, you've obviously operated for a long time very well with Walmart in your backyard. Any change in approach if there were to be a significant acceleration in any small-box openings? 
David Dillon: I think I feel like you answered the question for us by saying we've operated quite well when Walmart has been a significant factor in our markets. I see it exactly that way. And sure, there's some change in what their strategy is. But it's the same issue is making sure that we stay attentive to what our customers want in those markets and respond appropriately. Rodney, you want to add anything? 
W. McMullen: No. I mean, just your comment on really focusing on the customer. And our customers tell us there's a lot of things that we do a lot better than Walmart and we have to make sure that we keep doing that and delivering against that. 
David Dillon: Yes. In fact, I would add one other element maybe is that in this last quarter, in the second quarter, some of the things that you just described about Walmart planning to do, they actually have already done some of that in several of our markets. And that's reflected and contained in the overall results that we achieved in the second quarter. So think about it in that context. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: Just a few quick follow-ups. One question I had was just on your fuel business and the CPG assumption that you're using in your guidance for the back half of the year. It looks like that this was a really good CPG quarter. And I'm assuming also if you could tell us was it above-planned CPG quarter for you against such a strong result last year. And then also related to your gas business, how does the competitive environment look? Walmart's brought back the Murphy's deal. I think they just announced that this week. And I think some others, like Safeway, are going to be aggressive again with using fuel as an offering. And any color on that would be great. 
J. Schlotman: Well, on the fuel business relative to the CPG, the cents per gallon were obviously down a little bit compared to last year, as we said in the prepared remarks, almost $0.01 or actually right at a $0.01. 
Robert Ohmes: Yes. But I'm assuming you were -- that was a great CPG last year. I'm assuming that you might have been planning it down even more than what you saw. 
J. Schlotman: Well, I mean, actually it's not dramatically different than what our expectation was for this time of the year looking at the dollars of EBITDA that the fuel centers generated during the quarter. And earnings per share were exactly flat. And that was really driven by the ID gallon growth as well as unit growth, multiplied by the lower cents per gallon. So it's not just that cents per gallon, it's also our expectation of how we can grow identical gallons and the fact we continue to build more units. 
David Dillon: And then your additional question related to the promotions of fuel rewards at Walmart and Safeway are the 2 that you called out. And I would just put that in the same terms of what we talked about the competitive environment. There are always things happening with your competitors and with you. One of the advantages we have is over 1,000 fuel stations that are at our stores or just right down the block from our stores that are ours. And we also have a partnership, of course, with Shell, as you are probably aware. And then I don't want to lose track of the fact that we've got hundreds of convenience stores around the country, too, many of -- most of which have gasoline. 
Robert Ohmes: And just one quick follow-up on the last question. So with the Walmart Market Basket Challenge ad campaign, so are you sort of saying you have seen an impact in the markets that they've run against you with those ads? 
David Dillon: Actually, that's not quite what I meant to say, if that's what I said. What I meant to say was Walmart has done those activities that were being described, adding new stores, growing their neighborhood stores, and now you'd add to the mix the advertising program on pricing, and that those were out there last quarter. And that our results as a company for the last quarter include the fact that, that has happened in those markets. I wasn't trying to describe that it had an impact, I'm just trying to describe that it was included within the overall results that we achieved. We, of course, have seen the same ads that you've seen. And Walmart has, as they've described, been more aggressive in their advertising on those themes. 
J. Schlotman: And keep in mind all of our geographies had, all of our divisions had positive idents. 
David Dillon: Yes. I think that's important for us to call out is how broad-based our results were. It was all divisions, all departments. And we even called out that every division grew loyal households as well, which is quite important when you think about the competitive environment. 
Robert Ohmes: And the 55 neighborhood markets that they're opening over the next 6 months here, so pretty good acceleration for them. Do you have a sense if a lot of those are going to be targeting your markets or not? They won't tell us, so I was just curious if you guys are expecting... 
David Dillon: And so you think we'll tell you? Sorry. But we, of course, watch that very closely and we know in markets what's being built and what's being planned. We pay close attention to that. But that's not something we're going to talk about on this call. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth: I wanted to ask about the inflation outlook. You mentioned that inflation cooling had helped your volumes in the quarter. Given the drought, where do you think inflation is going in 2013? And maybe just give us a little color on the current quarter on the branded inflation versus the perishables. 
David Dillon: I'll let Mike comment in a second about our forecast on inflation. But I would just add a little bit of color. Last quarter, when we talked about this, we commented that we did expect -- continued to expect inflation to decline during this year. Our LIFO estimate certainly suggests that. And we did see that in the quarter. We also described that we expected last quarter, we described that as inflation came down, we expected some tonnage to improve because there would be less resistance by customers to buy the product. But we acknowledged that it wasn't deflation, that prices weren't going down. It's just that they weren't going up at the same clip. And I think that's proving out is that the inflation was down this quarter. Our tonnage has gradually begun to improve a bit. And that's all good news and in the direction that we had expected it to be. Mike can give a little bit of color to what we expect going forward. And you may want to add to his question about perishables and national brands if you want to add any color to that. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. It's a little early to start giving guidance for 2013. But just relative to the drought, I don't think the drought is going to have a huge effect on our inflation expectations for this year. And if it does, it would be very late in the year. I think a lot of the things like proteins and that will probably go down before they start to go up next year. I do think that the current situation will have some effect on inflation next year. I would look for things like proteins to get higher, mill prices will probably get higher, the cost of raw milk will probably get higher as the cost of feed goes up. But you also have to keep that in mind and balance it that the whole inflation picture isn't driven just by corn and wheat and soybeans. You have coffee out there, you have sugar out there, you have orange juice out there. You have other commodities out there, all of which go into a lot of food products that are in the mix of what inflation does that have gone the other way. So when you balance it all out, and we called out the produce and seafood, for example, this quarter had deflation. So when you balance it all out, I don't -- I want to have a little bit more time to see what the crop actually comes in at. But I'm not overly concerned about it at this point, but it's certainly something that as we start thinking about 2013, what effect it could have in certain areas of the store and the effect on the consumer. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And how about any of the growing regions where your perishables are coming from and maybe color on the current quarter on perishables versus branded items? 
J. Schlotman: If you look at the perishables, particularly in the produce department, it continued to be a fairly good growing season for those products, and the products were plentiful. I'm just trying to remember what produce inflation -- actually produce continued to be deflationary in the second quarter. So when you talk about perishables singularly in the produce category, it was deflationary. Meat was less inflation and seafood was deflation. Milk costs today are down from where they were last year and actually below the 5-year moving average. But as we get later this year and into next year, most forecasts would have milk prices going back up above the 5-year average and probably back up above where they were last year. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And the center store inflation is cooling? Or what's going on there in center store? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Grocery continued to decline. Keep in mind, grocery does include milk on a trend basis. It's not deflation, it's less inflation. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: If we could look at the second half of the year, what are you thinking about the impact of rising fuel prices on 2 things, the effectiveness of Fuel Rewards programs and a tolerance among consumers for shelf price inflation? 
David Dillon: Well, as we've talked about before, while I always worry about what happens with fuel pricing because of its impact on the psyche of the customer and the actual cash that they have in their wallet, we actually think it's probably a net-net slight positive in our direction. Fuel Rewards, of course, helps us. And having those over 1,000 fuel stations at our stores helps us. Our street prices on gas are quite competitive. And as a result, we are a place that customers find some reprieve really, to the extent they can get any reprieve as the cost goes up. So I think that's how we see that. I don't think from the grocery store point of view, it's pure and simple, to what extent does the customer have money to spend in the grocery store. And if it were to go up substantially, a big sharp increase, I think the customers would see less money in their pockets. And I think you'd see some reaction overall in retail. But I think we would be less affected if that were to occur. 
W. McMullen: The only other thing I would add is any time when fuel prices hit new highs, that's when customer reactions change. So if whatever the last cycle was, the last cycle, a lot of people had the $4 mark in their mind. Well, if fuel goes up to $4.25 or $4.50, the reaction will probably be different than just the price difference. And then the other thing in terms of Dave mentioned overall, we think it would be -- it's slightly beneficial to us that just the absolute convenience of our stores, when fuel prices are high, our stores are so close to most of our customers, most of our customers only have to drive 1 mile, 1.5 miles to get to our stores. So it's incredibly convenient, and it's a one-stop shop. So that is also another thing that we think helps. 
Charles Cerankosky: Switching subjects a little bit. The tax rate versus a year ago was quite a bit higher. Mike, what kind of guidance can you give us for the full year or the second half on Kroger's tax rate? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Well, what we said in the 8-K this morning is we expect it to be around 36% for the third and fourth quarter. 
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: I just had a quick follow-up on some of the questions earlier. First, on the pharmacy side, last quarter, you had provided some good detail on the comp rate and what was attributable to Express Scripts. I think you had referenced double-digits and about half. Is there any way you can give us an update on that in the second quarter? 
W. McMullen: If you look in the second quarter, it would be right at half again, maybe just slightly higher than half. And then I'd just remind everybody, Mike's comment, if you look at -- the generics obviously had a big impact, and Mike mentioned that's negatively affected by 0.5% on our total identicals from the generics. 
Stephen Grambling: And so that was -- okay. And then second follow-up, I guess, would be on the cost side. Could you maybe quantify the percentage of your cost basis that is variable versus fixed? And is that variable on tonnage? Or is that on total sales growth? 
David Dillon: Well, I remember when I took a cost accounting class that it seemed pretty simple that costs were either fixed or variable. But in fact, in our business, most costs have elements of each. And so it's really hard to describe it. So take labor as an example. One of our biggest cash expenses, but it's also one of our most important investments. You look at labor, and there's a high variability component to it, but there's also a certain fixed component to it, too. So we have to have a certain amount of staff there to open a pharmacy. But as volume grows, you don't have to add quite as much staff as it goes. So I can't really help you with your modeling in that sense, but you can almost do it just by looking over a course of years what our expenses have done. 
J. Schlotman: One of the things to keep in mind -- and we've obviously been very focused on driving our sales, which results in higher sales per square footage over the last several years. Stores at a certain sales level, almost all of the costs are fixed because you have to have that certain amount of labor. Once you get sales above a certain weekly amount or a certain sales per square foot, everything becomes variable. And that's where you really start to leverage all those fixed costs just to run a store regardless of what the sales are. And that's one of the reasons that as we continue to have more and more consecutive quarters of ID sales growth, why that's been so important in being a big lever in helping us leverage those costs because a big piece of them are fixed, just to turn the lights on every day. 
David Dillon: Before we wrap up, I do have a couple of closing comments. I often like to share additional thoughts with associates because we encourage our associates to listen in. So let me close with these thoughts. 
 Later this month, we will begin our annual Giving Hope a Hand campaign to support the fight against breast cancer. This year, 48 of our associates shared their personal stories of survival and hope. And that will be featured on specially marked packages of national and corporate brand products. These items will be sold exclusively in our stores across the country from September 23 to October 10. Since this campaign began in 2006, 249 brave women have shared their experiences, inspiring many others to fight breast cancer and survive. And I'm always grateful to their courage to do so. And in that same time, we've also raised more than $20 million for breast cancer treatment, research and education. And all of the donations go to local organizations fighting breast cancer and the communities that we call home. 
 In 2012, with the help of key vendor partners, we will raise $3 million more. Our associates and their stories will also be featured on sharingcourage.com later this month, a special website that includes a Wall of Hope, where visitors can post messages of support and share their own experiences. I encourage you each to read our coworkers' inspiring stories. They are truly remarkable. That completes the call today. Thank you for joining us. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2012-06-14 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Kroger Co. First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Fab, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Fab. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 We're very pleased with Kroger's excellent first quarter results. We achieved strong overall sales and solid operating performance. Our core business is growing, and we are rewarding shareholders through earnings growth, increasing dividends over time and stock buybacks.
 Identical supermarket sales were up for the 34th consecutive quarter, growing by 4.2%. We are able to deliver this kind of consistent performance quarter-after-quarter, thanks to our associates' commitment to our Customer 1st strategy.
 Here are a few highlights. Every supermarket department had positive identical sales, led by significant growth in natural food, pharmacy, bakery and deli. Every supermarket division had positive identical sales. Kroger's FIFO operating profit dollars grew, both with and without fuel, and it is our expectation to slightly increase our FIFO operating margin rate excluding fuel for the year.
 As a result of these strong results, we exceeded our expectations and, as a result, raised our earnings per share guidance for the year. Mike will provide detail on our full year guidance, as well as some other items that factored into earnings growth for the quarter shortly.
 So before I turn it to Rodney and Mike, I'd like to spend a little time discussing a question that came up during last earnings call. The essence of the question was how is Kroger growing market share and performing well, especially compared to traditional competitors? How are we different?
 Several years ago, we took a hard look at who we were really competing against, and that helped us realize we're competing against more than just traditional grocery retailers. Also, based on our research and our identical sales, we were not connecting with customers as well as we needed. In fact, customers told us we weren't doing a very good job. Their needs were changing, but we had not changed with them.
 These realities led us to develop our Customer 1st strategy and the 4 keys: people, products, shopping experience and price. We've pushed hard to save money in places not important to customers and to reinvest -- invest it in places that are important to them. This is the essence of the Kroger difference: solving needs for our customers, sometimes in massive ways and sometimes in a very targeted, personal way.
 Customers tell us they notice the difference. I believe this difference is why -- that we've had 34 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales. Identical sales are the most visible indicator available of a retailer's relevancy to its customers. I want to repeat that, it's very important. Identical sales are the most visible indicator available of a retailer's relevancy to its customers. That's why we pay such close attention to the identical sales trend.
 As we've grown our market share, some of you have also asked who is Kroger gaining from? But since we're targeting customers and not other retailers, there isn't always a clear answer. One thing that is clear, as we've grown market share, our customers come from a much broader base than just supermarkets. It is also clear that we compete very well with a broader array of food retailers, and this includes restaurants.
 We thought this background would be helpful to put in context our strong results and to project that at Kroger, we have and will continue to separate ourselves from our traditional competitors. In fact, we are creating a new industry.
 Rodney will now share some additional insight into Kroger's positive business trends in the first quarter. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave talked about how we have differentiated ourselves. One example of this is the joint venture we formed to create the consumer insight giant dunnhumbyUSA. Years of experience with dunnhumby have made us exponentially better at personalization and individual rewards. By deepening our focus on our customers, we have redefined our business model. It is more sustainable today than it was 5, 10 or 15 years ago.
 We also leverage our partnership with dunnhumby to better understand shopper behavior over time. In the first quarter, Kroger increased the total number of loyal households. Those households are making more visits. And while they are buying fewer items per trip, the total units we sell to our loyal customers have increased.
 We regularly seek customer feedback on how well we are executing in each of the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st strategy. Our customers tell us we've improved performance in each key. This improvement is consistent across all the keys, and we are 60% of the way towards the goals we originally set.
 We are happy with where we are, and we are a different retailer as a result. But there is offside to this. We still have more work to do, which is also very exciting.
 Product cost inflation continued in the first quarter. However, the rate of inflation is decreasing faster than what we expected at the beginning of this year. Identical store sales growth exceeded the rate of inflation, which we estimate was 3.9% excluding fuel. Deflation in the produce department offset somewhat the inflation in all other departments, including grocery, meat and bakery.
 Total tonnage change was slightly better than the fourth quarter. However, it was still essentially flat. Looking at one department with deflation, produce, we saw a significant growth in tonnage for the quarter.
 Kroger's corporate brand share and sales grew more than national brands in the first quarter. Corporate brands represented approximately 26% of grocery department sales dollars. Grocery department units sold are up 60 basis points to 33.6% compared to the same quarter last year.
 Our corporate brands team continues to create fresh and compelling products that fill unmet customer needs. We recently launched Private Selection's Snack Chips in 13 new flavors, including sea salt, cinnamon sugar and a new gluten-free rice and bean chip made from rice and azuki beans. And by the way, they're all very good.
 Finally, an update on labor relations. Our associates at King Soopers ratified a 2-year extension to the labor contract. We also secured a new labor agreement covering associates at our Smith's and Food 4 Less stores in Las Vegas. We have many contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, Memphis, Nashville and Portland. Our objective at every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages; a quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates.
 Next, Mike will share additional detail on Kroger's first quarter financial results and guidance for 2012. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our identical supermarket sales increased 4.2% in the first quarter, which contributed to net earnings totaling $439.4 million compared to $432.3 million in the same period last year.
 Net earnings per diluted share showed strong growth to $0.78 from $0.70 per diluted share last year. Our earnings per share growth was driven by EBITDA being higher than our expectations. Additionally, a tax reserve adjustment helped by about $0.015. FIFO gross margin was 20.7% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 53 basis points from the same period last year.
 We are pleased with this performance, which was consistent with our plan for the quarter. Last year, we saw a very strong gross margin in the first quarter. Kroger recorded a $46 million LIFO charge during the first quarters of both 2012 and 2011. 
 Operating, general and administrative costs were 15.36% of sales. Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A declined 27 basis points from the same period last year. Including rent depreciation, it was a 40-basis-point reduction. The benefits of leverage from productivity improvements, outstanding cost control and positive sales more than offset rising health care costs and credit card fees. Additionally, the consolidation of 4 UFCW pension plans in the prior year benefited operating expenses in the first quarter as we anticipated.
 Identifying and delivering sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest at all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy consistently over time. The company's FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, on a rolling 4-quarters basis decreased 11 basis points. This was a little better than we expected due to the higher EBITDA versus our original expectation that I mentioned a moment ago. We still expect FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, to slightly increase for the full year of 2012. Additionally, we generated more operating margin profit dollars this year compared to last year.
 Turning now to Kroger's retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers and convenience stores produced positive identical gallon growth. These outlets earned approximately $0.121 per gallon compared to $0.124 in the same quarter last year. The benefit to earnings per share was the same as last year.
 Now I'll update you on our financial strategy. During fiscal 2012, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain its current debt rating. Kroger repurchased 14.6 million common shares for a total investment of $345.3 million in the first quarter. The Board of Directors have authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaces the prior authorization which was exhausted on June 12, 2012, just a couple of days ago. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used its strong free cash flow to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
 Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $539.1 million for the first quarter compared with $573.1 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range.
 Net total debt was $7.8 billion, an increase of $662.1 million from a year ago. This is primarily the result of debt issued to fund our UFCW pension plan consolidation. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.91 compared with 1.79 during the same period last year.
 In March, we told you that we expect the external environment to be a little better in 2011. Generally speaking, this has been our experience through the first quarter. We continue to monitor changes in gas prices and inflation. And as the headlines continually remind us, macroeconomic issues will continue to affect consumer sentiment throughout the year. We are confident in our ability to make tactical adjustments as needed to successfully navigate these factors while continuing to deliver on our Customer 1st strategy.
 Kroger's long-term business model is to generate earnings -- annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2% for its shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. We expect this total return to compare favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon.
 We continue to expect fiscal 2012 earnings per share growth to be higher than our long-term business model, and our strong first quarter positions Kroger's for an even more robust 2012 than originally expected. Therefore, we've increased our earnings guidance for the first year to -- for the fiscal year to $2.33 to $2.40 per diluted share. The original guidance was $2.28 to $2.38 per share. The increase reflects the strength of the company's first quarter results.
 I'd like to share a little bit more about pharmacy's better-than-expected performance, which helped sales as well as earnings in the first quarter. Pharmacy achieved double-digit identical sales, about half due to new Express Scripts business and half from exceptional overall pharmacy performance. Even without Express Scripts, it was an excellent quarter for our pharmacies.
 Our ability to project pharmacy performance over the course of the year remains difficult when factoring in the benefit of Express Scripts and prescription drugs coming off patent. This quarter was good, and we were -- and we think we are satisfying new customers who transferred because of Express Scripts.
 We continue to expect identical sales to trend down throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as prescription drugs come off patents. For these reasons, we continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3% to 3.5%.
 As we said at year end, we expect second -- the second quarter growth rate to be in line with our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8%, and the third and fourth quarters will be higher than that. The fourth quarter will also benefit from the 53rd week.
 Now I will turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. This was another great quarter. We exceeded our expectations and, as a result, raised our earnings per share guidance for the year. Kroger's performance this quarter, like the 33 quarters of positive identical sales that preceded it, was the result of our focus on our customers. We're building relevant and personal connections with each customer, and that requires fresh new ways of thinking about our markets and our competition. That customers tell us we have significantly improved in the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st strategy, lets us know that we are not the same company today that we were even 7 years ago. We have differentiated ourselves from traditional food retailers and expect to drive loyalty, cash flow and earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.
 We now look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. 
John Heinbockel: So a couple of things, guys. When you look at your expectation for comps through the remainder of the year, what do you think happens to tonnage from where we are right now? Do you think we see any improvement? And it looks, by the work we've done, that competitive rationality continues to prevail. People aren't doing anything dumb at this point. Do you see the same thing? And would you expect that to continue? 
David Dillon: On the tonnage for the year, we've said, I think all along, that as inflation comes down, which is what we expect to have happen, that, that -- while that's not negative, that doesn't mean prices are going to go down. It just means the rate of growth would slow. But we do think that, that will, in the long run, be positive for tonnage. However, tonnage will be slower to recover than the rate of inflation will come down, I believe. That's a personal opinion. We don't have any way to prove that till we actually go through it. And the reason I think that is because the economy, from a shopper's point of view, is not in all that great a shape. So it's not going to cause customers to jump back on the wagon unless they've got more money to spend. But we do expect it to positively affect tonnage, just at a slower rate, that's all. As for competition, we would agree with you. It's been a rational market. I think everyone realizes it's a tough market out there for customers, and I don't see a lot of overreacting going on. Rodney, you want to add any color to that? 
W. McMullen: No. No. 
John Heinbockel: All right. Secondly then, if you think about deployment of your cash flow, arguably, you're in the best position you've been in, in a very long time competitively. Stock is as cheap as it's been in 10 years. So how do you think about 2 things: one, being more aggressive with your buyback effort to the point of possibly levering up a little bit to do that? And secondly, how do you think about the dividend payout ratio? I know you have a target in terms of yield, but where do you think you ought to be in terms of payout? 
David Dillon: I'll have Mike answer both of those in detail here in a second, but I will tell you that part of the answer you can find in the fact that our board authorized stock repurchase to start back up again as we finished that earlier this week. And that was intentional because, we agree with you, our stock prices is cheap. So Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Relative to the buyback, we finished the quarter at 1.91x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We think being in the 2 to 2.2x range is something that the rating agencies would be comfortable with and allow us to continue to be a BBB flat credit which is important to us. It's not saying I want to be a 2.2x because you do like to have a little cushion, operating cushion and not live life on the edge necessarily. And over the last 4 quarters, we've returned $1.6 billion between buybacks and dividends. I think that's a pretty healthy return back to our shareholders. And relative to the dividend payout ratio, this will be our seventh year of paying a dividend since we've reinstituted it, and we've increased it every year. And we said at the outset and we continue to say, our plan would be to: once you start a dividend, you want to maintain it and not have to stop it and continue to grow it over time. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. 
Deborah Weinswig: In terms of categories, I thought it was very interesting. You talked about every supermarket had positive identical sales led by growth in natural foods, pharmacy, bakery and deli. I was wondering if you could provide some more color around those particular categories. 
W. McMullen: Well, obviously, the pharmacy department, as Mike mentioned, was benefited from Express Scripts. But even without Express Scripts, pharmacy had a very strong identical sales growth. And the team, when they put together a plan on addressing -- getting the identical -- the additional Express Scripts business, really did a nice job of making it broader than just trying to get that business. And they've done a very nice job. Obviously, in natural foods, it's a trend change or a continued trend of people eating more organic and natural foods. And as we do a better and better job in that area, we're able to -- for a customer to eliminate one extra shop, and they can get those items from us at a price point that's very reasonable. On produce -- well, in deli, bakery, we've had strong results there for a while. Produce is kind of interesting. They had fabulous tonnage growth. The identical sales weren't so -- it was positive, but not so much, but the tonnage was just outstanding. 
Deborah Weinswig: And then, Dave, you had talked about this idea of kind of creating a new industry, and I know that when your peers talk about your performance -- I mean, they really do stand in awe. I mean, as you look into the future, and I know that Kroger is always on the cutting-edge of technology, what do you think continues to differentiate Kroger from the pack? 
David Dillon: Well, I really think it's the way in which we've looked at the business, and that was the point of the opening comments that I had, is that in the past, if you go back 15 years ago, we kept thinking like a traditional grocer. And we kept thinking that our competitors were traditional grocers, and we kept thinking about where you get customers is by competing with traditional grocers. The difference for us has been by focusing on customers, we're defining the industry we're in by how the customers think of it, not how we previously thought about it. So as an example, we used to think about it as people who buy food in supermarkets. But today, they buy food everywhere. They go to the club stores, the dollar stores, the mass retailers. They go to lots of places that are not supermarkets. And in fact, if you were to list our top competitors based on market share of the markets we operate in, the top 2 or 3 would not be traditional supermarkets, aside from us. And as a result, we don't really see that to be the universe that we're operating in. We see it as totally different, and we've had to approach it differently. And I think that, that's the reason we've had better results, because we're swimming in a pool that's bigger -- we were thinking about it as bigger -- than simply what the market was for traditional retailers. It's almost a classic business school case study, to show how you define your market and how you think of yourself will often determine who you become. And I think that's very true for us. 
W. McMullen: Dave, the only other thing I would add, Deborah, to your question, one of the things that we've really been working on hard, and this has really been over the last several years, is not having a strategy that's only dependent on one competitive advantage. And if you look behind the strategy, there's really 10 or 12 different critical pieces. We often obviously talk about dunnhumby, and that would be one of the piece. But that isn't the only piece. And we believe over time that creates a bigger and bigger competitive advantage because the competitor can try to get as good on one particular part, but to do all the pieces is a lot harder. And that's really -- when Dave talks about creating a new industry, that's one of the things that -- we don't know quite what words to use other than we know it's a new industry, because there's really not anybody else competing on such a broad level of experiences. Obviously, technology is one piece of that, too. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank. 
Charles Grom: Just wondering if you -- a 16-week quarter, just wondered if you could shed some light on how your ID trended throughout the period? And if you could, how things are going in the first few weeks here of the second quarter? 
David Dillon: Well, let me answer the second part first and then I'll let Mike give you a little color on the trend and how we see it. Currently, for the quarter that we're in now -- and we're only, what, 3.5 weeks, I guess, into it -- we're down slightly from where we ran in the first quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into that because we have seen in the last -- well, even in the last year really, higher volatility between weeks than what we had been -- customers experiencing maybe years back. And as a result, it would be real easy to over-read a number like that. But after just 3.5 weeks, that's really not enough to read. But it is slightly down. In addition to that, we're seeing clearly the effect of the generics that we talked about in pharmacy. That is some of the brand name prescription items that are going to generic, which brings the price down very quickly. And you can see it literally by week. In fact, I'm looking right now at a graph that shows by week the way in which these are coming off of patent and how it changes our sales. So that makes a really big difference. And I probably ought to add, someone in here reminded me to make sure I emphasize the point, is that when I say we're down slightly, I'm saying down from the 4.2%. We're not negative at all. We're still quite positive. We're still quite positive and quite pleased with where we are in sales. I wanted to make sure that got clarified. Thank you. 
Charles Grom: Okay. And then the trend during the quarter? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, it's kind of hard to answer the trend during the quarter, to break it down into distinct 4-week periods, primarily because holidays shifted between some of those periods this year. But when you kind of lap over those kinds of issues, it was relatively consistent. Obviously, when we've reported March, we said we were close to the fourth quarter numbers. So it trended down a little bit throughout the quarter, but that's kind of consistent with what Dave talked about. As prescription drugs come off generics, that's kind of the trend we expected. So relatively stable, a little bit of noise. Clearly first of the month, end of the month kind of phenomenas. But overall, fairly consistent throughout the quarter. 
Charles Grom: Okay, great. And then just my follow-up, Mike, for you, is your core FIFO gross profit margin compares get real easy here over the next few quarters. Can you hold our hand on how we should think about that line item over the next 3 periods? I know you're saying total EBIT core, you expect to be slightly up. But how should we think about the components of FIFO, GPM and SG&A? 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I won't give guidance on the specific lines. Obviously, the rolling 4 quarters is down 11 basis points at the end of the first quarter, and our guidance is for that to be slightly better at the operating profit line. So that means we need to make up the 11, plus a little bit throughout the rest of the year. And to your point, the first quarter was our toughest compare quarter. A significant amount of the EBITDA we generated last year over 2010 was generated in the first quarter last year. And that's why we're comfortable that we can continue to slightly expand that by the end of the year. And the 11 basis points down did not alarm us. In fact, it was better than we had expected because of the stronger EBITDA in the first quarter. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ed Kelly with Crédit Suisse. 
Edward Kelly: My question for you is on the ID guidance. You had mentioned on the call that inflation is decreasing or decelerating at a faster rate than you thought. So what have you embedded in the guidance, the ID guidance for the rest of the year on that? And since it's unchanged but there's less inflation, does that mean that you changed your outlook for the way that you think tonnage is going to play out the rest of the year? 
J. Schlotman: I don't know that we would change the way we think tonnage is going to play out. We ended the first quarter at just under 4% inflation. If you look inside the grocery category, which is half of our sales, it actually got lower every 4-week period, the way we measure it internally. So clearly, there's a decline going on at a pretty ratable measure throughout the year. If you look at where we think it might be at the end of the year, we're guessing under 3%, 2% to 3%. And when I talk about lower, I mean lower inflation, not lower tonnage. We would actually expect some tonnage increase as we go throughout the year. And Rodney's illustration in commodities like produce that are very price-sensitive, and lower prices means a great crop that eats very well, we saw extraordinary tonnage growth in produce in the first quarter. So we would expect tonnage to get a little better throughout the year and inflation continue to trend down a little bit. 
Edward Kelly: Just say we talk about an environment where maybe inflation in the back half of the year is -- let's just say it's not 2% to 3%. Let's say it's something lower than that. And for you guys, it's fine that your ID goes from 5% to 3% or 2.5% or whatever it might be, provided it's still a good number and that's not really in your control. But you've got this pretty big gap with your competitors. And under that environment, it means that their sales maybe turn negative. And what does that mean from a promotional standpoint, I guess, number one? And then if inflation's a little bit lighter, how do you manage your business if that ID, let's just say, ends the year at less than 3%? 
J. Schlotman: I think at the end of the day, it depends how you wind up getting to the 3%. I can't speak to how a competitor may manage their business. We spend enough time trying to figure out how to manage our own, let alone worrying about how others are going to manage theirs. Obviously we think about things, would they get promotional or do something hotter if there's negative ID sales. But at the end of the day, the important component is the tonnage. And when you look at some of the things that are elastic, that have elasticity of demand inside the grocery department, things like milk, milk prices continue to trend down. And the reported ID sales, to the extent that the generics coming off of patent affect that, that actually has a higher gross profit rate. So I think if -- stepping back and looking at your business overall, is tonnage moving in the right direction? What are your ID sales trends doing, unaffected by prescriptions coming off patent? And understanding all that, I think it's manageable for us. We don't foresee deflation by the end of the year. We foresee a little bit less inflation. That doesn't mean -- which doesn't mean lower prices. It probably means stable shelf prices or slightly up shelf prices. 
Edward Kelly: Okay. And just lastly for you, can you maybe give us an update on the state of the consumer as you see it now? I mean, obviously, volumes across the industry have been fairly weak. Are customers just kind of getting by with buying less? Is there differences in income brackets? Just your sense as to really what you're seeing at the customer level. 
David Dillon: Well, what's going on with the customers today is much like what we described in March. We're seeing those whose life and economic status is strong. Feeling and acting a little bit like they're -- that the recession is over or, certainly, that the economy has improved. We're seeing those who are on tight budgets and those who are more price-sensitive. Their behavior is being affected more by the economy. And I think overriding all of that is the fact that if you look at just generally the geopolitical world right now, people are a little bit nervous. And so there's a little bit of anxiety out there on the whole that kind of dampens their enthusiasm, even for those that are on the high end. That's how I would read it. Rodney, you want to add any more? 
W. McMullen: I mean, I think overall, it would be pretty similar to what we said at the first year end. We continue to see it getting a little better but boy, it is very slow and bumpy from week to week. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: It's our understanding that the price investments you made in California recently were successful. So 2 questions. First, is that the correct assessment, that you got the tonnage response you wanted? And second, if so, based on that success, to what extent might we expect maybe an accelerated investment in other banners down the road? 
David Dillon: Well, I'll let Rodney answer the particulars, but let me just remind you that what we've said about price investments for actually many years now is that it's a long fuse. It's not the kind of thing that you invest one day and the next day you declare victory. You invest one day, and the next year, you decide whether or not it was a really good move or not, and you make adjustments maybe week-to-week and month-to-month. But it's not something that you can read that quickly. So Rodney, you want to give any color to this? 
W. McMullen: Just a couple of comments. Our team at Ralphs and our -- have really done a very nice job of explaining to the customer the changes we made and the total value that we're offering versus before. So we really think it's our associates that have done a nice job of communicating the value to the customer, is the reason the customers are reacting in a positive way. Some of the things that we did at Ralphs were things that we'd already done in other parts of the country earlier. So it's really just from -- some of it was just from a timing standpoint that we now had the resources to do it at Ralphs. So overall, pleased with where we are. Probably be about all the comments I'd make. 
Kenneth Goldman: Okay. And just to follow up on a point you made earlier, you talked about one of the reasons not to raise the payout ratio is that you wouldn't want to have to cut it once you raised it. I'm curious, one, why you'd ever have to cut it. And two, if you're buying back stock, you're rewarding investors for selling your stock. And if you're paying a dividend, you're rewarding investors for keeping it. Wouldn't you want to reward the latter more than the former? And I guess, just as a lower growth company versus the S&P, not your peers, and you do throw off a lot of cash, a higher payout ratio might seem somewhat befitting, and you might attract more income-oriented investors. So just curious how you do think about that, if we can get any more color. 
W. McMullen: Sure. I don't think I said I was worried about having to cut it. I said, from an overall dividend strategy, a company, once you start a dividend, you go down that path wanting to make sure you can maintain it and grow it over time. That's more of a textbook dividend philosophy, not a Kroger worry that we're worried about cutting it. We have grown it every year since we've instituted our dividend. We would expect to continue to grow our yield and payout ratio over time. We think our stock, where it's been trading particularly of late, is a very inexpensive buy, and we think the potential return for us on buying the stock and at this point in time really rewards that share -- I think it does reward that shareholder who continues to own our stock and not sell the stock. I'm not really rewarding the shareholder who sells the stock to me at $22 a share. I'm rewarding the shareholder who continues to hold that and is going to enjoy the ride up from $22 with us as we continue to generate great results. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Robert Ohmes: It's Robbie Ohmes. Just a couple of quick questions. The first was if you could comment on -- is the percentage of your customer base on EBT, has that continued to totally flatten out? Or is that still increasing? I was just curious. And then the second question was just on the strength of your natural foods business and how you're approaching that. I was just curious if you could maybe shed some light going forward, how you see that area of your business linking in with dunnhumby. Is it linked in with the dunnhumby JV already and being used to continue to drive loyal customers? Or is it an area that you merchandise that is just gaining momentum on its own? And maybe just give us some color on how you foresee that part of your business playing out over the next year or 2. 
David Dillon: I'll comment on the EBT and then I'll ask Rodney to comment on the natural food trend and the rest of your question. We are not seeing an increase in the EBT percent of our business. What we are seeing though, of course there's been some variations from week-to-week and even month-to-month in various markets, and a lot of that has to do with the way states are paying out those benefits; often, they're spreading it out now rather than all at the first of the month, which is what they used to do. And so it's a little bit hard to read, but it's definitely not rising. If anything, it's settling down just a bit. But it's just a bit, so I wouldn't read a lot into that either. Rodney, you want to comment about natural food? 
W. McMullen: Yes. On the question on dunnhumby, natural foods has always been tied into dunnhumby. Now -- it would be true for natural foods and other parts of the store, too. We continue to get better at target marketing personalization for all customers to make sure that they understand what we offer in natural foods. The biggest growth in natural foods is really regular customers that aren't just diehard natural foods or organic shoppers are finding some of the products taste better, some of the items -- they just like the item, it's more creative. So you'll see customers that aren't necessarily just natural foods shoppers but shoppers that find something they like and they'll buy in that category. And certainly, my wife and I would be one that would fall into that category. 
David Dillon: Rodney keeps bringing examples of new stuff in for us to try, so he speaks from experience. 
Robert Ohmes: Great. And just one last follow-up question. I was curious, I know Wal-Mart has launched a sort of a different TV advertising campaign in a bunch of markets and, I think, in some cases, or at least in one, they've included polling someone who's shopped your store and tried to show a more competitive average basket. And I was curious if you could comment on whether you've felt any significant impact from that approach. 
David Dillon: Well, we won't talk about any specific competitive issues, I don't think. But generally speaking, I think you can see, with our sales and the trends that we've identified, that's probably the best way to describe where we are. And remember that what we've said is our whole program is more than price. We've invested a lot in price certainly, but what we've tried to do is neutralize price from being the main issue, to where the main issue for us is our people and our products and our shopping experience. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. 
Meredith Adler: I want to talk a little bit about gross profit dollars. It seemed -- and people kind of obsessed with comps when they look at slowing inflation, but I think gross profit dollars are more important. What happens when -- with the deflation in produce and you saw a big increase in volume, would you also say that gross profit dollars were up? 
David Dillon: Mike, you want to comment? Or -- we're actually going to look that up and see if we can give a more specific answer. 
J. Schlotman: I don't have that at the tip of my fingers [indiscernible]... 
David Dillon: I would agree with you though on the theme of gross profit dollars. We think about our business in terms of dollars and not in terms of percents. 
Meredith Adler: And certainly, we know gross profit dollars per script are higher with generics. 
David Dillon: Yes, yes. In fact, in pharmacy, it's crystal clear that while we're -- our sales change, because of the generics, is actually pretty radical on those items. But the gross profit dollars is similarly radical in the other direction. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the produce department, our gross profit rate would have been down because of the deflation. But because of the tonnage, we generated a pretty good amount of incremental gross profit dollars. 
David Dillon: Yes. Just exactly what you were thinking, Meredith. 
Meredith Adler: Yes. And I guess you had talked about moderating inflation in some other categories, not outright deflation, and that inflation could come down faster than tonnage would go up. But do you think that still the net impact of all of that would be the gross profit dollars, at worst, would be flat? 
W. McMullen: I would think -- I mean, if you look at specific guidance, you'll always have exceptions. But when you look at it overall, we're still expect and focused on having improving gross profit dollars when you look at it overall. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. So I can tell people who are worried about the moderating inflation to cool it, just calm down. 
David Dillon: Yes, we think so. 
W. McMullen: Yes. 
David Dillon: I would completely agree with that view. 
W. McMullen: And remember, part of the change in our expected identical sales is because of the -- all the prescriptions coming off patent, as Dave and Mike mentioned. And that improves gross profit, and that's something that's -- this year, the number of drugs, as you know, coming off patent, is significantly higher than any year, certainly since we've been involved in this business. 
David Dillon: Yes. And we've overemphasized that point for a reason, because we're really kind of nervous that when you see what we've forecasted for the identical sales for the year, you'll -- someone will read that and conclude that things are getting worse. But in fact, the pharmacy affects most or all of that. 
Meredith Adler: Just talking about pharmacy quickly, first, do you still think you're getting more than your fair share of Express Scripts customers, the ones who are leaving Walgreen? And then also, how sticky do you think they would be if there was a resolution between Express Scripts and Walgreen? 
W. McMullen: To me, that's a great question. It's always tough to answer because it's one of those where I'll answer it both ways. You never get -- unless you have 100% of something, it's never your fair share. So -- but if you look at the share that we think we're getting of the Express Scripts, it's certainly higher than our market share is of pharmacy in the markets that we operate in. So we certainly feel like we're getting more than our fair share based on that. On the stickiness, the real key for us is making sure that we're delivering great service to those customers that come to us. Because when they come to us, that's one less shop they have to go to, and we should be able to save them time. As long as we have good -- great service and the prices are right, that should be the stickiness. And we're doing an awful lot of work making sure that the customers tell us how we're doing, specifically those customers, and making sure any things that we can do better, we're focused on doing better. So if that did change, there would be more stickiness to that customer. 
Meredith Adler: And do you have tie-ins with your frequent shopper program and deals to create loyalty? I mean, one of Walgreen's weaknesses, in my opinion, is that they don't have a frequent shopper program. Is that something that you think helps you keep the customers? 
W. McMullen: We certainly do. And you should assume that anything that you can imagine, we're trying to do those things to help improve that stickiness. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company. 
Mike Otway: This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Just kind of in terms of a follow-up from a question earlier. With fuel having come down pretty decently and going below that $3.50, an important $3.50 mark in some markets, have you noticed a change in the consumer or in consumer spending in the last few weeks specifically? 
David Dillon: Not that I can discern. Rodney, anything you could... 
W. McMullen: No, I would agree with that. 
David Dillon: And I don't remember exactly where it was the same week last year, but -- the real issue on fuel, at least in the quarter, was that it did not rise as much as had widely been anticipated. It was still generally up. 
W. McMullen: The other thing I think from a consumer standpoint, they're still nervous about is it a permanent decline? Or it just happens to be 2 or 3 weeks? And I think that really have behavior change, customers have got to get comfortable with more than just 2 or 3 weeks. 
Mike Otway: Understood. And then I guess just switching over to SG&A quickly. You guys had some nice leverage there. As inflation continues to decelerate and comps come in further, at what point do you start to delever? Maybe perhaps some color around there would be great. 
J. Schlotman: Yes, I think we'll be fine on our ability to do that with the productivity processes we have and getting better execution on the productivity. Also keep in mind, as the sales, ID sales in the back half of the year get more affected by the generics, those do generate a higher gross profit. So when you look underneath the dollars we have to spend on that OG&A, we should be able to get sufficient coverage of that, which is the cornerstone of us guiding to a slightly improving operating profit for the year. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital. 
Karen Short: Just quickly again on Express Scripts. I just was wondering, were you guys actually -- did you gain more share on Express Scripts than you expected to? Or can you maybe just give a little color on that? 
W. McMullen: I'd say we're -- so far, it's been a little bit better than we expected, and we continue to stay focused on that. So yes. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then looking at operating expenses, I guess, if I remember correctly, in the first quarter of last year, you seem to have a similar pattern where you got the expense savings ahead of spending, which is just kind of what you plan on -- you indicated you planned on doing going forward. So is it fair to say that, that's kind of what happened this quarter? You definitely saw some expense savings ahead of the investment in price, and we may see investment in price accelerate throughout the rest of the year? 
W. McMullen: I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean, it's one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we raised the guidance, so that you could see that some of the extra improvement in the first quarter, we actually think it will flow through for the whole year. If you look at our expense savings versus what we expected, we're pretty in line with what we expected. And we did a nice job of balancing between gross and OG&A improvements. And we're really focused on trying to make sure the 2 tie together. I don't know, Mike or Dave. 
J. Schlotman: We have to balance it for the rest of the year because at the end of the first quarter, with the operating profit margin down 11 basis points and guidance to slightly grow that by the end of the year, we have to remain in balance. Otherwise, that won't be the result. 
Karen Short: Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at your cash flow, I was just curious, accrued expenses definitely was a benefit for you guys. Is there anything to talk to there? 
J. Schlotman: Nothing specific. We can talk offline on that. Taxes are in there, but nothing outlandish that I can think of. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets. 
Jonathan Feeney: I wanted to follow up a little bit, because you -- an earlier caller mentioned lower gasoline prices' effect on the consumer. But what I'm interested in is when you -- first of all, when you go '08 into '09, you saw some significant dis-inflation and then deflation, and the tonnage went through the roof at that time. And are there -- I guess what I'd ask is are there areas outside of produce where you believe a significant -- I know you're not calling for that this year, but let's just say relief and perhaps decline in some of your costs and some of the prices you're able to offer consumers would stimulate more demand and actually drive tonnage? Because I've been hearing from some of the food manufacturers for a long time, about this consumer whose got $100 to spend at the grocery store and has been having to stretch it further and further. Do you get more discretionary buying if that $100 actually winds up going further at some point over the next 6 to 12 months? 
David Dillon: Well, when I think about inflation, I always separate the perishable departments from the packaged products in the center of the store. That's important because the behavior is actually quite a little bit different. So I would expect some inflation and deflation happening over any course of the year in both produce and meat as examples. And we just manage that in the course of business. And you have behavior that happens like what happened in produce last quarter, which we've described. But the essence of your question really goes to the center of the store and the packaged goods. And normally, when I'm talking about food inflation, I'm usually talking about that because it behaves a little less erratic. The deflationary times that you talked about before was where the CPG operators needed more tonnage. Their costs were such that they needed to reinvest back in their products. They'd let their prices get too high. As commodity costs went up, they went up, and they went up a little higher plus some, and then they had to overcorrect actually in the other direction. So tonnage then did pick up. You were right about that particular case. I don't think we've seen quite the same overreaction so far on the upside this time, although I could be wrong. Some individual operators could have a different view of that. And so it remains to be seen how they'll behave. I don't know, Rodney, if you have any additional color. 
W. McMullen: No. 
David Dillon: So I don't think -- we're not really thinking that there's going to be some erratic change here. 
Jonathan Feeney: So you think a decline and -- a significant decline, let's say down 1% or 2% versus, let's say low-single digit we're thinking about, by the end of this year now would drive additional tonnage in the center store? 
David Dillon: Well, I think that's -- first, it's hypothetical, and I just as soon not get into all the possible scenarios that could happen. But second is that it would be highly dependent upon individual companies. So if a company invested in their products and sold them to us at a lower price and had them retailed as a result at a lower price, it sees tonnage in those items. But whether or not you'll see that or not is really going to be up to those individual companies. 
W. McMullen: The other thing that was going on back in '08, '09, as Dave mentioned, some of the CPGs were making way too much in margin. And part of the huge tonnage growth we experienced and saw was in our own brands. And it's one of the values that we have because we have such a strong corporate brand program across so many categories. When the economics of the product is different than what the CPGs are charging, we can't -- we will give that benefit to the customer, and we always get rewarded in huge tonnage increases. And if you remember, we had tremendous improvement in market share on our corporate brands at that point, too. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Mike, it's not that often that we hear you talking about pharmacy during the call, so I wanted to ask if that was a meaningful swing in year-over-year EPS contribution for pharmacy this quarter. 
J. Schlotman: Well, it certainly helped the EBITDA growth in the first quarter, but there were plenty of other items inside the other departments that contributed to the EBITDA growth being stronger than we expected for the quarter. As Dave and Rodney have both said, every department inside the store had positive ID sales. So it was a pretty good broad-based improvement across the whole complex. There's always rough spots anytime you have to do as many things as we do. There's always things that could be better. But we were pretty happy with the overall balance inside the quarter. 
Mark Wiltamuth: As you look at the year, how big do you think the overall ID drag could be from pharmacy because of the generic effects? And do you think it makes sense to maybe call out the ID without the pharmacy in some of these future quarters? 
J. Schlotman: We've made a commitment to talk about the pharmacy as we go throughout the year and try to describe the effect of that. I don't want to commit right now what I will give or not give, and we'll look at that throughout the year. There's just so many moving parts with some moderating inflation, some higher gross profit rates from generics, the addition of Express Scripts. It's kind of early in the game, if you will, to make a decision on exactly how we'll break that out. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And just -- can you -- any way you can give us a magnitude on how big the overall drag effect could be for the whole year? 
J. Schlotman: We think, for the whole year, it could be as much as 50 basis points drag on IDs. But it will be increasing as we go throughout the year, to Dave's earlier comment. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. 
Alton Stump: Just to follow up on a couple of questions earlier. The talk with the CPG companies moving into the back half of the year and how they got huge margins looking back to '08, '09, if that happens again, how much leverage does Kroger have to push back on CPG companies to bring down their pricing? 
David Dillon: Well, first, let me comment that since it's 11:00, this will be our last question. 
W. McMullen: [Indiscernible] 
David Dillon: Oh, we'll have time for one more. Okay. Before we get to that, I wanted to make sure you had a time reference here. But in thinking about CPG companies, one of the reasons Rodney pointed out about our Kroger brands and its success, and we had continuous success in the first quarter, was to illustrate that we do have leverage, particularly when the underlying commodity economics don't match what's happening in the market. We, of course, would experience some of the same costs that other manufacturers would experience. But when they stray from those basic economics, we have pretty good leverage. Do you want to add anything on that? 
W. McMullen: No, no. 
David Dillon: I think that's how we see that, and so we feel actually pretty good about it. The other thing I actually would add, and I've said this several quarters, is at Kroger, we have had really good success and we have partnered with a number of national brand vendors in very successful ways. And so we have a number of places where our tonnage is up with particular vendors because of plans that we've laid. So that actually is some leverage, too, on the other direction, because we have the capacity to produce really good results for individual companies out there. 
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. 
Andrew Wolf: Just wanted to ask you 2 questions on your sales trends. First, Dave, I think you said the volatility was pretty high in weekly ID sales. 
David Dillon: Yes. 
Andrew Wolf: Now is that a change in trend? Is that new? Or has that been sort of the way it's been for past few quarters or so? 
David Dillon: Well, it's certainly been true in the last few quarters. It's different than it was several years back. And the reason I called it out is it makes it hard to read individual weeks. And when you only have 3.5 weeks in a quarter and any of that included an end of the month or first of the month which are the hardest to read, and especially when you have a 2-day shift because of the leap day that is now in our numbers, so the first of the year in any future month this year is 2 days removed from where it was last year, you see even more erratic swings in those weeks. So I just think it's hard to read such short periods of time, and you have to take a little longer to look at it. That's really what I meant. 
Andrew Wolf: Got you. And the other question is on the slowing in ID sales you're describing kind of incrementally. Should we think of that as basically all due to inflation and volume trends are kind of sticking around flat? Is that what you're trying to tell us? 
David Dillon: I think that's fairly close. I mean, a little more positive than that, actually. Because as you know, it's hard -- it's really hard to read tonnage. It may sound like it shouldn't be, but it actually is because of the mix changes and all these other things. And we're really trying hard to give you a fair picture of what we think is happening. And it sounds contradictory, but we don't think it is to say, first, as we clearly saw, that tonnage is mildly in the positive direction from where it was last quarter. But it's not so great that we're trying to call that up. We're still calling that basically flat. 
Andrew Wolf: Got you. Okay, great. 
David Dillon: So it's a positive message, not really a neutral message.
 Before we end the call, though, I would like to share a few additional thoughts with our associates who listened in today. We encourage them to listen, and so I'll take just a minute or 2 of your time still. I want to thank all of our associates for your tireless efforts to keep food safe for our customers and their families. The International Association for Food Protection recently named Kroger the recipient of its Black Pearl Award for 2012, which recognizes excellence in food safety and advocacy. Rodney and I are especially proud of you for this recognition. Only 4 other retailers have been so recognized by this association. I'm certain that what the association saw in Kroger is our success in continually raising the bar on food safety. Keeping food safe for millions of our customers every day is a tremendous responsibility, one that reflects our deepest commitment to putting customers first. Food safety is everyone's fight every day. Our latest program, FAST, which stands for food at safe temperatures, reminds us to keep products below the low limits in cases, minimize stocking time on refrigerated products and keeping cooler and freezer doors closed. These simple steps help us serve safe and delicious food every day. Thank you for this gift to our customers. This completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q4  (2012-03-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 The Kroger Company Earnings Conference Call. My name is Fab, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Fab. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.
 Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. 
 I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2011 results are Rodney McMullen, our company President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
 We are very pleased with Kroger's outstanding performance in fiscal year 2011 and strong fourth quarter financial results. That we were able to raise earnings per share and identical sales guidance through the year and achieve those higher results demonstrates the strength of our business strategy and momentum for a strong 2012. 
 Kroger's strong performance rewarded shareholders in 2011. We delivered adjusted earnings of $2 per diluted share, a 15% increase in earnings over 2010. We hit the high end of guidance despite a much higher LIFO charge. We increased our quarterly dividend payment by almost 10%, and we implemented an aggressive stock buyback program using Kroger's strong free cash flow to repurchase 67 million shares. Later, Rodney and Mike will provide more details on our full year performance. I'd like to highlight several of the commitments that our teams successfully delivered on in 2011. 
 Kroger increased identical supermarket sales. We grew market share. We effectively used free cash flow to reward shareholders and invested wisely to continue to win customer loyalty. Importantly, we also balanced cost reductions with investments in our Customer 1st strategy to increase FIFO operating margin for the year. Kroger is off to a healthy start for the year ahead, and we expect earnings per share growth in 2012 to exceed our business model. 
 Kroger had strong performance in the fourth quarter. Identical supermarket sales for the quarter increased 4.9%, excluding fuel. More loyal and total households are shopping with us, and identical sales are up among both groups. This consistent sales performance contributed to Kroger's market share gains in fiscal 2011. And we achieved the high end of growth estimates for both earnings per share and identical sales growth. 
 Our operating performance was broad-based and consistent across the company. Every operating division achieved positive identical sales for the quarter, and every supermarket department achieved positive identical sales. Our natural food, pharmacy, produce and deli departments posted the strongest results. I'm very proud of our associates for bringing customer -- the Customer 1st strategy to life for our customers. Our relentless focus on our 4 keys, our people, prices, products and shopping experience, is why Kroger has achieved an industry-leading 33 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales results. Our associates work to please and delight our shoppers inspires customer loyalty, which grows our business and generates shareholder returns. Simply put, we put our Customer 1st -- when we put our customers first, shareholders win. 
 Well, as we look to 2012, we expect the external environment to be a little better than 2011. All of the data we're seeing suggests the overall economy and customer sentiment are improving. Both give us reason to be optimistic about the year ahead. We're also mindful that consumer sentiment is fragile. And as we've seen over the last few years, it can be affected by external factors such as rising gas prices and geopolitical issues. So we will continue to carefully monitor the pace of economic recovery, higher gas prices and the slowing of the rate of inflation. And while these factors will influence all retailers, our success will come from making tactical adjustments as needed throughout the year, just as we did throughout 2011. 
 Rodney will now offer insight into Kroger's strong business trends in the fourth quarter and 2011 market share statistics. Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on building loyal customer base continues to increase sales and reward shareholders. Today, close to 50% of all U.S. households carry one of our loyalty cards. That percentage obviously is much higher in the markets where we operate. 
 One of the ways we create value for our customers is by leveraging scale and position as a share leader in most of the markets in which we operate. Even with Kroger's deep market penetration, we have a tremendous opportunity to increase incremental spending among our loyal customers, who on average spend about $0.50 of every food dollar with Kroger.  Kroger's partnership with dunnhumby is another powerful way we build our loyal household base. The unique customer insights gained from our loyalty data help us reward our most loyal customers with highly relevant, personalized offers for the products they like and buy regularly. 
 In the fourth quarter, the number of loyal households shopping with us increased, as did the total number of households. Loyal household unit purchases and price per unit sold were both up in the fourth quarter compared to the same time last year as well. While our loyal customers are buying fewer items each trip, they are buying more on a monthly basis. A key indicator that our loyal customer strategy is working is that our identical sales growth among loyal households outpaced the growth for total households. For the full year, our number of loyal households continued to increase as did the number of their visits. Total household shopping at our stores also increased year-over-year. 
 We still anticipate inflation in 2012, but we expect to end the year with a rate of inflation lower than at the beginning of the year. The increase in food costs moderated slightly in the fourth quarter, with year-over-year product cost inflation of approximately 5.4%, excluding retail fuel. Higher prices have taken a toll on all customers, but our very price-sensitive customers continue to suffer disproportionately.  Most departments experienced inflation during the quarter. The produce department ran counter to this trend in the fourth quarter, experiencing deflation. We are passing along product cost increases from national brand suppliers and plan to continue to do so. At the same time, we slightly increased our penny profit per item in the grocery category in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. As always, our popular corporate brand products continue to offer customers thousands of quality, affordable choices to fit into any budget. 
 Looking at unit sales. Similar to the third quarter, tonnage was essentially flat and slightly improving as we ended this year. We expect to see improving trends in tonnage growth as the economic conditions improve and inflation moderates. While the industry as a whole experienced the effects of consumer caution and higher food prices, Kroger performed exceptionally well by staying relevant and providing value when and where customers needed it most. 
 For example, when we saw customers under pressure in the second quarter, we accelerated investments to alleviate some of that pressure. Even as inflation forced shoppers to be more budget-conscious, our customers continued to experience Kroger's unique value proposition, a convenient and superior shopping experience, low prices and with hot weekly promotions, personalized rewards developed through our dunnhumby partnership and our popular Fuel Points savings program. That collection of benefits, teamed with our high-quality, competitively priced corporate brand offering, positions Kroger to win in the marketplace today while investing for the future. 
 Kroger's strong corporate brands continued to gain share in the fourth quarter. Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of the grocery department sales dollars and 35% of the grocery department units sold. Corporate brand sales dollars were up more than national brand sales dollars for the quarter as well. As Dave said, one of our fastest growing departments is natural foods. Our customers told us they want organic and natural products that are easily identified and affordable. So we launched our new Simple Truth Natural and Simple Truth Organic brands in November, focusing first on milk and eggs, with plans to expand into other categories throughout 2012. Another successful growth category for corporate brands is yogurt. We've leveraged our manufacturing competitive advantage to accelerate the growth of our corporate brand Greek yogurts. Greek yogurt sales have doubled in each of the last 3 years, with Kroger's offering outpacing the category in unit and dollar growth. 
 Now turning to market share for 2011. We look at market share the way customers look at it, where they spend their money. According to Nielsen Homescan data, Kroger's overall share of products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during fiscal 2011. This data also indicates that our share increased in 13 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report and declined in 6 areas.  Walmart Supercenters are our primary competitor in 17 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report. Kroger's overall product sales in those 17 markets grew approximately 40 basis points during fiscal 2011. This Nielsen Homescan data is generated by customers who self-report their grocery purchases to Nielsen. This includes all retail outlets that sell the same products that we do. 
 Next, I'd like to give you an update on labor relations. As you realized, our associates play a big part in building customer loyalty. Kroger's commitment to our associates include our dedication to safety, significant investments in training, solid wages and good-quality, affordable health care. We have to deliver this in ways that allow us to operate competitively with the nonunion retailers in each of the markets that we serve. Kroger financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs. Cooperation between Kroger and the local unions that represent many of our associates is essential. We have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business, and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities for all of our associates. 
 We are pleased that our associates ratified a master agreement with the Teamsters covering 3 distribution centers and 2 dairies. Currently, negotiations are under way with the UFCW for store associates in Memphis and Las Vegas. In 2012, we had labor contracts expiring in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Louisville; Nashville; Phoenix and Portland. 
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's 2011 financial results and our 2012 guidance. Mike? 
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Including the effect of the UFCW pension plan consolidation, Kroger reported a net loss for the fourth quarter that totaled $306.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of the pension consolidation, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $283.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share. It is important to keep in mind LIFO was $31 million or $0.03 per diluted share, higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. 
 Net earnings in the same period last year were $278.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin as reported was 21.13% of sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal -- of the year. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 47 basis points from the same period last year. As I said earlier, our LIFO charge was higher than expected, totaling $73.4 million. This compares to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
 Excluding retail fuel operations and the pension consolidation, our OG&A, including rent and depreciation, declined 21 basis points. OG&A declined 8 basis points, rent declined 3 basis points and depreciation declined 10 basis points. Identifying and executing sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest in all 4 elements of our Customer 1st strategy: our great people, our product offering, our customer shopping experience and lower prices for our customers. 
 Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2011 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. In the fourth quarter, Kroger's retail fuel operation has generated identical gallon growth. These outlets earned approximately $0.124 per gallon compared to $0.102 in the final quarter of fiscal 2010. This part of our business benefited Kroger's year-over-year net earnings per share increase for the fourth quarter by $0.02. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.139 in 2011 compared with $0.122 in 2010. 
 Turning now to Kroger's full year fiscal results for 2011 and excluding the effect of the pension consolidation, earnings for 2011 were $1.2 billion or $2 per diluted share. Including the effect of the pension consolidation, fiscal year 2011 earnings were $602.1 million or $1.01 per diluted share. Full year net earnings in the prior year were $1.74 per diluted share. Our original earnings guidance -- or our original earnings per diluted share guidance for the year was $1.80 to $1.92. This contemplated a LIFO charge of $50 million to $75 million. As the year progressed, we ultimately revised our EPS expectations to $1.95 to $2, even with the LIFO charge at the time that was expected to be $185.5 -- $185 million. That we hit the high end of our increased earning expectations with a full year LIFO charge of $216 million speaks loudly to Kroger's strong underlying performance. Excluding fuel and the pension consolidation, FIFO operating margin increased by 5 basis points. This is the fourth consecutive rolling 4-quarter period with an expanded operating margin. 
 Now I'll provide a little color on the effect of the pension consolidation. The charge totaled $590.7 million after tax. This affected the fourth quarter by $1.04 per diluted share and the full year by $0.99 per diluted share. The difference is due to having fewer shares outstanding in the quarter versus the year. The charge is higher than the $0.73 per diluted share we discussed in December. Our commitment under the agreement is to fund the full December 31, 2011, underfunded balance. The amount we discussed in December only addressed the cash contribution we made. For multi-employer pension plans, cash contributions and expense are usually the same. However, since we have a contractual obligation to fund a specific amount, we need to expense that incremental commitment.  We have committed to fund the remaining obligation by the end of 2018. At the time it is funded, no additional expense will be incurred. We met our additional -- we made our initial funding of $650 million on January 20, 2012, $50 million of which was attributed to 2012 plan year contributions. 
 Under Kroger's share repurchase program during fiscal 2011, we invested $1.5 billion to repurchase 66.5 million shares of Kroger stock at an average price of $23.24 per share. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has $379 million remaining under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in September of 2011. 
 We focus on identical sales growth, excluding fuel, because it is the best measure of performance to let us know that we are delivering for both our customers and shareholders. 33 quarters of consistent identical sales growth tells us that our Customer 1st strategy continues to connect meaningfully with our customers. That connection enhances customer loyalty and grows market share, which increases earnings and generates free cash flow that reward our shareholders. Customer 1st drives shareholder returns. 
 Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2%, for a total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. We expect this total shareholder return to compare favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon. Annual earnings per share growth for fiscal 2012 will be higher than this due to a combination of the benefit of the 53rd week, a lower expected LIFO charge, our ability to aggressively repurchase stock during 2011 and benefits from the pension consolidation. 
 Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2012. For the full year, we anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. This guidance contemplates the effect of several prescription drugs coming off patent during the year, which will reduce sales. As Rodney said, we expect units to increase if inflation moderates, so this should offset any effect of lower inflation. Full year net earnings are expected to range from $2.28 to $2.38 per diluted share. This guidance assumes the benefit of the extra week, lower LIFO, the benefit of our stock buyback program during 2011, the benefit of our pension plan consolidation and some benefit from  Express Script transfers. Kroger's quarterly dividend enhances total shareholder return by approximately 1.5% to 2%. 
 I'd like to provide some additional insight on our identical sales and earnings per share expectations on a quarterly basis as well. For earnings per share, we expect the first quarter to pose the biggest challenge. Last year's first quarter presents a tough comparison, and the expected lower LIFO charge will not affect year-over-year comparisons until later in the fiscal year. Conversely, we expect identical sales to start the year stronger and trend down as prescription drugs come off patent. The generic prescriptions, which generate higher gross profit rates, along with the benefit of expected lower LIFO as the year progresses, will cause stronger earnings per share growth in the third and fourth quarter. The fourth quarter will also benefit from the 53rd week. As a result, we expect earnings per share growth in the first quarter to be flat to slightly positive, a growth rate in quarter 2 that is in line with our business model and a strong performance in the third and fourth quarters. 
 We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2012, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to fiscal 2011 results. We expect to expand Kroger's nonfuel operating margin rate over time, and it remains our goal to do so. We expect our full year LIFO charge to range between $140 million and $190 million. During fiscal 2012, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain its current debt rating. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range for the year. 
 This morning, we filed an 8-K summarizing the guidance and financial strategy that I just discussed, along with some additional items, including pension contributions and expense and our tax rate. 
 Now I will turn it back to Dave. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. I am very proud of our associates for delivering such outstanding results in 2011. Our consistent performance is one of the reasons that Kroger has created more than 29,000 jobs in the past 5 years. Kroger is rewarding shareholders, and we are looking forward to another year of consistent industry-leading performance and growth. We now look forward to your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. 
John Heinbockel: A couple of things interrelated. If you look at, Mike, the details you gave quarter-to-quarter, to what degree does that bake in anything specific with regard to moving around programs, promotions, et cetera? And I'm wondering because you talked about the second quarter last year and some of that pressure that consumers were under was fuel-related, how do you guys look at the current run-up in gas and where we might be in the spring? And is there a need to do something more this year to offset that new pressure on the consumer? So have you built that in explicitly, do you think that's something that may have to happen? 
J. Schlotman: Well, as we've begun the year, we certainly have a plan laid out of how we expect to invest in the elements of our Customer 1st strategy, and it does contemplate what we see out there. But as we said in the prepared comments, we did make tactical adjustments throughout 2011 to react to the world around us, and we would expect to continue to do that in 2012 as well. And I think it proved out beneficial for everybody in 2011, given our results. 
W. McMullen: And those tactical changes -- John, this is Rodney, won't necessarily be the same every year. And so there wouldn't necessarily -- just because of what we did last year doesn't mean we'll do the same thing this year. And it really depends on what our insights tell us that is important to our customers. 
John Heinbockel: Do you think the customer will be under less pressure for whatever reason? Let's say, gas is $4, $4.25, Memorial Day, less pressure this year than last year because the macro's better? Or same pressure, more pressure, what do you think? 
David Dillon: Well, John, those are, of course, all the right factors. And how they weigh out is going to be hard to judge. Certainly, on the plus side, the economy is clearly improving. And except for the very price-sensitive customers, which Rodney mentioned are still suffering disproportionately, otherwise, it's holding up quite well and we're very pleased with that. And customer sentiment, which is also important in how people feel about things, is also improving. Those are both good signs. So even with higher gas prices, it's possible that those factors end up overweighing that. And as you know, there are some pluses of higher gas prices for us, one is our gas promotion has a good effect. And the other is that a lot of our stores are located within a couple of miles of where customers live, and that becomes a very convenient place for them to shop when prices get high. So it's not like it's all bad news. There are certainly some bad news with it because it's less money in their pocket. But on the whole, we remain optimistic. 
John Heinbockel: All right. And then just as a follow-up to that is I don't know what inflation number -- it sounds like it might be like a mid-3s number or something like that, that's baked into your LIFO charge. But is that right? And then secondly, obviously, if it comes down in the back half of the year, you'll end up with some significant adjustments in the second half. Just talk about just tactically, if LIFO ends up being $50 million, $70 million, some large number lower than you think, can that be effectively reinvested in the business or it's hard to do that effective -- productively? 
J. Schlotman: Well, a couple of things on LIFO. I think I've proved my inability to project LIFO throughout the year this year. And it's a very difficult thing to do. The other thing, John, to keep in mind is LIFO is a noncash charge, and it doesn't use cash or create cash when I book that charge. So if it goes up or down, it really doesn't affect my ability to have money to invest to reward our customers. Does it affect earnings per share? Absolutely, but it really doesn't give me any incremental dollars to invest somewhere else. 
John Heinbockel: Okay. And then just one last thing. The 6 markets where you lost share or didn't gain share, I guess, I assume that was not a material loss of share. And was that because you didn't comp well or because some competitors may have comped particularly well for whatever reason? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. Well, when you look at those 6 markets, it's extremely modest. But a 0.1 is a 0.1 because we do take it literal in terms of what the report says. So it's not necessarily a reflection because it could actually be rounding -- but the numbers are what they are. In every market, we're very pleased with our identicals. And as Dave said, our identicals for the quarter were very broad-based across the whole country and very broad-based across all departments. And we felt very good about where we are overall. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. 
Kenneth Goldman: In the last couple of months, Nielsen data, food manufacturers, some of your competitors, they've pointed to an accelerated channel shift out of traditional into some alternatives. And your numbers seem to be bucking this trend. I know you touched on how you did this, and I do appreciate that color. Just one follow-up. In your mind, are you avoiding the loss of customers that some other supermarkets have seen across-the-board? Or maybe are you losing some customers in the bottom end? As they go to some limited assortment channels, maybe you're making that up on the top end, as you gain from some consumers finding your value proposition more attractive? I'm just hoping you can sort of add a little bit more color as to how you were able impressively, frankly, to do this when some of your competitors have not. 
David Dillon: Well, let me ask the question slightly differently. We think of market share -- and we've thought about this for years now, I'd say 15 years at least, maybe 20. Instead of looking at our traditional supermarkets, we look at the pie as being a lot bigger than that. We were looking, as Rodney said, where our customers spend their money. And because we look at it that way, our battle has been for a market share of that bigger pie. And that attitude, that viewpoint, has caused us to address it, I think, differently than some of the other traditional supermarket operators. There are some out there who have done it maybe similar in their thinking, but our objective is to solve what the customer needs solved and not to solve maybe what is a traditional supermarket equation. And that line of thinking actually has led us down this path of Customer 1st. We've talked a lot about it, and it sounds more like marketing words, but actually, we genuinely mean it. We look at the 4 elements of Customer 1st. We invest in those in the ways that we believe are meaningful to our customers. We save money in places that don't matter to the customer and reinvest it in the places that do. And I think it's that approach that has created the results that you described. I would agree with your viewpoint, we think we have not suffered the same channel changes that others have, but we've had to live in the same channel changes that others have had to live with. And we just had to address it in a different way. 
W. McMullen: The only thing, Ken, that I would add -- and I agree with everything that Dave said. And I think increasingly it's probably one of the things that people look at Kroger probably incorrectly because they try to put people into channels. And if you look at what a traditional supermarket would be, and you go into our stores today, it's nothing like what that traditional supermarket used to be. And it really -- there really is a new category that we're in that we're satisfying the needs based on what customers are telling us they want that Dave outlined. And I really do think it's one of the things where, we, along with our investors, probably try to stick things into channels, and it really is what we're trying to create with our customers, a channel that's completely different than anything out there. And I think our customers are showing it and our associates are executing against it for our customers that show that, that's actually happening. 
David Dillon: We've actually described internally what you're talking about in saying that the grocery industry as we all grew up in it really doesn't exist anymore. And we'll occasionally use the term traditional grocery because it helps relate to things that you all will describe and that you're describing now. But we don't think of that as our industry. We don't have a real good name from it other than food, but it is a broader industry than just that traditional food industry. 
Kenneth Goldman: And sorry, just one follow-up. That's all very helpful. But how would you describe the major differences between you and a traditional grocer at this point? Because to me, and maybe I'm seeing this incorrectly, you clearly have differences but you're still selling mostly food. I mean, the prices are cheaper and you have other offerings and you have fuel and so forth, but it's more close than not. So perhaps help me understand where I'm maybe not seeing the differences. 
David Dillon: Well, your list was right and the so forth is a longer list, too. Just contrast us with ourselves instead of looking at what you're comparing to. Look at ourselves in the 1990s to now. And even though we had good earnings growth during that time, our sales were not strong. We were losing our relevancy with customers. And we were really more focused on just producing earnings. When we moved to a point of view that says we've got to solve issues for customers, putting our customers first, that in effect, indirectly gave us a stronger result for our shareholders. And we felt it would and it has proven to be true. And sometimes in life, and I think it's definitely true in business, if you go after something directly, you may get it for a while but you won't get it forever. But if you go at it indirectly by serving the broader goal, the broader goal for us is our customer relevancy, then you end up serving the shareholders as well. And I think that's what we've seen happen. So I would prefer to contrast us with ourselves. And all of the things you described are true. Each of the 4 keys has specific things about them that we have done. We've talked about many of those over the last several years. But we've worked hard on each of the 4. It's not any one of them, it's all of them. So I don't know if that's help you anymore, but... 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital. 
Karen Short: I'm just wondering -- a couple of questions here. I don't know if you commented on this, but what are -- I'm assuming comps are, I think, kind of trending in line with the fourth quarter results and the quarter-to-date. Is that fair? 
David Dillon: Let me just give you a summary on it. We had, through last week, which is 4 weeks, our identical sales without fuel would be comparable to where we where in the fourth quarter. We did not update it to this week because this week frankly is not comparable because with the leap year day that we added, we now have a bigger shift in first of the month than normal. So it's not a comparable week. And we are still seeing this year and last year high variability from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and so that enters into it, too. But through the 4 weeks anyway, I'd say the identical sales were comparable. 
Karen Short: Okay, great. And then I guess, just looking at -- I know you've veered away from talking about thi,s, but just directionally, looking at selling gross margin. Earlier in fiscal 2011 when you were still kind of talking about it, you were discussing the cadence on a 2-year basis because there was a lot of volatility. I guess, maybe can you just give me your directional thoughts on selling gross trends into fiscal '12, same kind of level of investment in '11, a little lower, any color? 
David Dillon: Well, first, we're not going to put it in terms of selling gross margin. While it's still an important concept for us to think of in running our business, we think it adds too much confusion to the discussion. But directionally, you've heard us say we work backwards. We said that we expect our FIFO operating margin rate to slightly improve in 2012, so that we put it in the K and described that already -- or in the 8-K we filed today. So you start with that, and everything else works back from that. You should expect, as we've said before, some additional investment in our gross margin -- FIFO gross margin. And as we do that, though, you should also expect over the course of the year, that we'll have savings that will offset that so that we end up with a slight gain in operating profit margin. I don't know if that helps, but we do expect some investment certainly. 
Karen Short: Similar to last year, is it fair to say that you will find the savings at the early part of the year to then spend it slightly more towards latter? 
David Dillon: I think the only comment I'd make on that is just refer back to what Mike said about the flow of the quarters through the year. That contains -- that guidance on as you think about the quarters gives you the best feel we have for the way we currently expect it to flow. But as we've pointed out, we also make tactical adjustments as the year go on. And if we've done that, we'll try to identify that if it's meaningful. 
Karen Short: Okay. And then just the last question. Looking at your share repurchases in fiscal '12, I guess, obviously, this is a high year. But in '12, what do you consider kind of a more normalized cadence on the share repurchases or maybe in terms of free cash flow allocation? 
J. Schlotman: Yes. If you look at it over time in years where we haven't done an aggressive buyback like '11, it's typically been in the $400 million to $600 million range. We like to do enough to offset dilution, and it's relatively steady throughout the year. Don't have a particular target in mind as I sit here today because some of it is driven by all of the forces around us and what other opportunities we have to invest in cash. I'm happy with my debt rating, my guidance on -- our guidance on CapEx is a little bit higher because we continue to see some phenomenal store sites come our way and some technology projects that we think will be attractive returns for the long haul. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Wanted to dig in a little bit here on the OG&A line. Are there any health care and pension increases kind of embedded in that number that you're going to have to overcome throughout the year? 
J. Schlotman: Throughout next year? 
Mark Wiltamuth: Yes. 
J. Schlotman: Well, I mean, the pension -- if you look at the pension overall, if you set the contracts aside where we consolidated the pension plans, the remaining plans would have some increases in them, and all OG&A would certainly have increases in them. If you look at UFCW pension plan expense overall, because of what we did in December, that contribution and expense should decline overall in 2012. And we talked about that benefit back in December when we announced the consolidation. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And moving over to your gasoline business. Are we still seeing that effect when rising gasoline prices are occurring that you get a margin drag? Because you seemed to have a pretty good margin performance this quarter and for the year. 
W. McMullen: Mark, yes, that would typically be the case. 
Mark Wiltamuth: Okay. And so far in the first quarter, do you feel like there's dramatic weather difference versus last year which might be helping? Or how does that stack up? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the weather so far, weather definitely was a bigger help last year than this year. We've had very few snowstorms this year. And obviously, when there's snowstorms, kids stay home and they eat at home versus at school. So we really haven't -- we didn't have those -- very limited benefits in the fourth quarter. We've had very little of those benefits in the first quarter also. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company. 
Scott Mushkin: First, just a curiosity. I know you guys have a huge pharmacy. Are you seeing any benefits from the Express, Walgreen dispute? And do you think it's going to be additive to your first quarter EPS? 
W. McMullen: If you look at the guidance that Mike outlined for the year, we included some benefit for Express Script transfers to Kroger. If you look at where we're trending right now, our increases are a little bit more than what we were expecting. So to the extent that it's better than what we had built in, yes, it would be a positive. Obviously, if they settled tomorrow, that would also affect the number. The other thing that we will plan to do is at the end of each quarter, give you some insight in terms of what the Express business helped us by, so you could have some insight and get a feel for that, but we did include some. But right now, we're actually doing better than what we included. 
Scott Mushkin: And did you guys quantify -- and maybe, Mike, I missed this. Did you quantify for the first quarter what you thought it would add to your EPS? 
J. Schlotman: We did not. 
Scott Mushkin: Did not. Is it going to be -- is it meaningful or no? 
J. Schlotman: We did not quantify it. 
Scott Mushkin: Okay. Switching gears a little bit because we've covered a lot on this call. I'm just kind of curious with the acquisition strategy. I know we talk about it every once in a while. It seems like maybe you could do some maybe larger accretive transactions. And I was just wondering, is it time to get a little bit more aggressive? And would you ever think of deploying your capital? I know you talked about the dividends and the share repurchases more aggressively in M&A. 
David Dillon: If I had the script from the last time we answered that question, I would just replay the tape for you because it's the same answer. We're always interested, always looking, highly selective... 
J. Schlotman: And don't need them to make the numbers... 
David Dillon: Yes, we don't need them to make our numbers. Lots of companies that give forecasts for the year assuming they'll make acquisitions. We never do that. 
Scott Mushkin: But no consideration right now of getting a little bit more aggressive, given you guys are doing well, the channel seems to be suffering? 
J. Schlotman: We're not opposed to them, like Dave said, but we're not going to change the metrics we look at and stretch to do something because of the current environment. If it meets our metrics, we would certainly look at it. And if it doesn't, we won't. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital. 
Meredith Adler: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about competition. I think everybody is saying that it's been quite rational. And I think having positive comps for many people because of inflation helps the psychology for retailers. But maybe you could talk a little bit about any thoughts you might have, if we end up with really modest inflation at the end of the year, do you think there's some risk that there's going to be a pickup in competition? 
David Dillon: Well, first, I would agree with you, Meredith, that the competition has been rational. It doesn't mean it's not significant. It's been quite significant. And last year was just like we've seen in previous years, lots to address, and we fully expect that going forward. I do think there's a psychological effect when identical sales are positive that cause people to be a little bit more rational than they might have otherwise been. But actually, when we saw a deflation a couple of years ago, behavior was -- for the most part, there were some moments, but for the most part, it was more rational. We called out a few times in the quarter calls where we saw some blips and differences, but generally, it wasn't too bad. And that was with deflation. But what you described and what we certainly are forecasting is not a deflationary environment but one that's just a little less inflationary than it is currently. And so I would not expect to see an environment that was much different than what we've been seeing, fiercely competitive but certainly rational. 
W. McMullen: The only other thing I would add to that, Meredith, is we also expect the economy to improve a little bit, and we do think the improvement in the economy would help everybody's volume go up a little bit and spend on an item, a little more expensive items and those kind of things. So I think that is also in the background. 
Meredith Adler: Okay. And then I have a question. You clearly are doing a very good job of managing expenses. The FIFO gross margin was up, which it hasn't been for a while. Is there any particular area of expense, shrink transportation, that stands out as a positive for you guys in 2011? 
David Dillon: Yes, you want to comment on it, Rodney? 
W. McMullen: Yes. One of the things we're really pleased about is it's really broad-based. And there isn't just one place where you can go and say half the savings is being created by this one item. It really is all across -- all the departments. Shrink results were very solid, our warehouse and transportation group did a nice job. And when you adjust for fuel, it's even better. If you look at our store teams, they did a very nice job of, and Dave mentioned it earlier, really identifying things to make work more efficiently, where the customer is not -- it doesn't benefit the customer, and then we reinvest some of that to help the customer, other places we help to invest in lower pricing. So it's really very broad-based, which is one of the things we're very pleased about. 
Meredith Adler: And that's great. And my final question would be about the labor negotiations. I looked at the 8-K, and there was actually commentary that said there's a bunch of markets you're going to be renegotiating, and the negotiations are going to be challenging. I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened in 2011. And in general, because obviously, every market is different, how did the course of those conversations go between wages and health care and pension? 
David Dillon: I'll let Rodney maybe comment in a second. But the language we used in the 8-K and that we use today is actually pretty consistent with how we've seen the world for a long time, that there's lots of pressures that need to be addressed. And on one hand, as an employer, we genuinely want to provide positive wages, good wages that are viewed in the market as good wages and good solid benefits. I mean, those things actually matter to us that we can provide that. At the same time, we recognize we have to be cost-competitive, and so we work hard on that. But that's not a new phenomenon. And the challenge of the negotiations is also not new because there are some structural legacy issues in contracts generally that need to be generally addressed. So as to the specifics, though, I'll let Rodney comment on that. 
W. McMullen: Yes. The only other thing, when you look at '11, I don't think there's anything specific. One of the things I've been very pleased with, the union and our labor negotiators is just sticking with it. Because the things that you've outlined, obviously, it's a great deal of difficulty. Dave outlined we want to make sure that we have a very solid wage benefit and health care benefit package that's extremely competitive in the marketplace. And I've really been impressed with everybody's commitment and persistence in just trying to keep talking about it, working through it, engaging our associates, trying to understand what really works and allows us to stay competitively. So that piece, I would give both parties high marks on sticking with it. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything unusual to talk about on '11. Obviously, as you look forward, you have the new health care laws that start changing a lot in 2013. And how that affects and what uncertainties that creates will be a lot of the discussion, I think, in '12, too. 
David Dillon: Meredith, the pension agreement we reached last year is a really good example of what Rodney was describing, of people sticking with it, working through it, trying to find a way to make that all work. I think that took us, I don't know, 1.5 years... 
J. Schlotman: 18 months. 
David Dillon: To work through. Yes. So it just illustrates that point. That was a good question, though. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. 
Charles Cerankosky: If we looked at Fred Meyer and your jewelry store business separately in the quarter, fourth quarter, can you talk about how those businesses performed? And I'm thinking about what kind of seasonal kick they had versus management's expectations? 
W. McMullen: If you look on the, I would say the grocery side, but it's broader than just grocery at Fred Meyer, it was phenomenal. When you look at the nonfood side and jewelry, I would say it was a solid year. If you look at our performance versus the publicly reported companies, we've outperformed most of those companies, so it was solid but it wasn't something that was spectacular. So overall, we felt really good about it. But it wasn't something that was just blow-away-good that it really drove the numbers in a different level. 
Charles Cerankosky: Now when you say jewelry was solid or the nonfood side of Fred Meyer was solid, I think you described both as solid, was that upsales and earnings versus a year ago? 
W. McMullen: Up on sales. If you look at the 2 combined, up on earnings -- not necessarily up on earning, jewelry would've been not up on earnings. 
Charles Cerankosky: All right. And then if you -- I want to go back to comps and look at it a different way. If you sort of took your households and divide it in 3 economic or demographic tranches, how were comps between high, low and middle groups? 
David Dillon: Well, if you did it based upon their sensitivity to price, which is one of the ways we look at it, the tier that is most sensitive to price was challenged, and it's suffered disproportionately. And we think it's a direct result of retail prices on food being higher and them not having any more money in their wallet to spend. So the units went down and those numbers were not very pretty. All of the other segments were -- would've been good and strong and up and positive. We ought to also comment that corporate brands had a terrific quarter and a terrific year. We noted the 35% of grocery units, that's back up to the peak that we've ever achieved, and that's where we're just about 1.5 years or 2 ago. 
J. Schlotman: And that does sort of detemper the identical sales number, because it can be the same number of units, but it's a lower retail price. And that strong offering can actually show up in that way, and it may look like the ID number in a certain category is worse than it really is and you have to factor that in. 
David Dillon: I agree with that. And let me add one other thing. This might give you a little bit of color. We've often identified a few categories or products or brands and so forth that have done well. And let me just highlight those and maybe a few others. We've, obviously, in several quarters past, talked about natural foods and organic produce, sushi, Boar's Head, Starbucks, prepared foods, all of those had really good results. But we would add to that list, floral -- and we had, by the way, a good Valentine's Day, a strong Valentine's Day. Greeting cards are actually up, cosmetics are up. Those are areas that we've seen some improvements in. And that would give you a little sense of the optimism that we have is that we're seeing a little broader customer recovery than what we'd seen before. But still that bottom group that is most price-sensitive is definitely a challenge right now. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank. 
Charles Grom: If I take your comments there, Dave, just on the broader customer recovery and the quarter-to-date comp trends that are up, say, 5% and with the Express Scripts benefit coming in a little bit stronger so far, can you kind of help me triangulate back to that 3% to 3.5% comp guidance as we think about the full year? 
David Dillon: Sure, I'd be happy to and Mike and Rodney may have some additional thoughts, too. But first, when you think about 3% to 3.5%, it could initially give you a feeling that we're not very optimistic about the year. But don't think that at all. In fact, it's just the opposite. Those numbers reflect a surprisingly high impact of moving some drugs off of patent and into the generic prescription world. And it is, quite frankly, impactful on our total company numbers. And that's the primary thing that's driving that. And so I want to make sure you see that we feel pretty optimistic about what this future looks like. It certainly includes our view that the economy is going to improve. It also includes our view that the customers' world is improving. And it includes our view that inflation will moderate a bit as we get later into the year. You want to add anything more to that, Mike? 
J. Schlotman: The other thing is, is that the 3% to 3.5% won't be smooth throughout the year. We expect higher numbers in the first part of the year, and it will decline as the year goes on as a result of what Dave said with those generics going off-patent. And there's a couple of reasons for that. I don't want this to be a pharmacy call, although Lincoln Lutz may like that, but the first 6 months that we have -- that those drugs go on off-patent, there is an exclusive generic provider, so that's a step down in sales a little bit. And then after 6 months, it steps down again. I don't mind sharing that specifically that impact that Dave talked about. Our estimate of the effect of the drugs coming off-patent and going to generic on our total book of business is 50 basis points. That's not 50 basis points on pharmacy sales, that's the overall reduction in business for the company. That doesn't really -- but they come at little bit of higher gross profit rate. And that's one of the reasons I went into the detail I did on explaining how the year is. So that's going to have a disproportionate effect in the back half of the year. But we don't believe our profits will suffer because the gross profit rate on those is higher. And it will stand a little counterintuitive to the model we've espoused for so long, but we're just trying to give some transparency into how we see the year shaking out. 
Charles Grom: Okay. No, that's actually very helpful. And then just if I could follow up on the first quarter guidance, say, a little bit better than $0.70, $0.71 for EPS. If we think about, say, a high 4% comp and SG&A leverage consistent with what you did -- can you just help me out on the LIFO charge for 1Q? It would really appear that there's going to be another step-down on the core FIFO in 1Q. I just want to make sure if my view is correct. 
J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't think that's necessarily the case. That's potentially possible. But keep in mind, last year's first quarter was just a phenomenal quarter. Everything that could possibly go right went right. And my comment on the LIFO, when you look at where we were on LIFO early in the year last year, it's that kind of in the range or close to the range that we're expecting for the full year this year. So we had to increase our LIFO throughout the year in 2011. And so we won't get any benefit on earnings per share from a significantly lower -- or from a potentially lower LIFO charge until later in the year when we had to catch up the full year. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Kelly Bania: This is Kelly Bania actually in for Robby Ohmes. I was wondering if you kind of broadly look back at the year how you would characterize the level of price investments. Was it maybe above normal or normal? And as you think about next year, you talked about the external environment improving. What would you be planning in terms of price investments? And how could the benefit of the shift to generics possibly help fund some of that gross margin investment next year? 
David Dillon: Well, let me first comment on last year. I feel like some of our investment in gross margin certainly was on price programs. But some of it was with a high rate of inflation. A higher rate of inflation tends to bring the gross profit rate down just a little bit, unless you try to chase the percentage, which we typically have not done. And that's a little part of it, too. So I wouldn't try to subscribe that all of the gross investment last year was purely based on our price programs and things we were trying to invest in like that. And as for this year looking forward, I think it would be very similar to that kind of thinking. I don't see it as a big difference, although I do think that the inflation's going to change a little, it will moderate a little bit. And so the impact from the inflation might be a little less pronounced during the year. Rodney, you want to add more color to it than that? 
W. McMullen: Yes. The only other thing I would add is I always think that you have to separate the grocery and drug/GM departments away from the fresh departments in terms of meat, produce. And those departments are heavily influenced by commodity prices. And if you look at 2011, certainly from a commodity price inflation standpoint, it was significantly more than normal, which caused more-than-normal to get passed to the customer. But at the same time, there were times when we paid our fair share of that cost. So I really think you have to separate it into 2 buckets. And when you look at just the grocery departments in those, it was a pretty normal year. We would expect '12 to be pretty much staying along the same lines. On the fresh part of the business, that's much more commodity-driven. 
Kelly Bania: Great. And then just another question on market share. Thanks for all the color there. I was wondering if you could elaborate on fourth quarter market share trends versus Walmart. I think you mentioned you were up 40 basis points for the year. Wondering if that's changed at all in the fourth quarter? It sounds like Walmart's getting a little more price-aggressive. I'm wondering if you saw that or if there was any change. 
W. McMullen: We really don't talk about by quarter-by-quarter because when you look at it within quarters, and this has been true for the last, I don't know, 5 or 10 years or however long we've tracked it, a lot more variability across quarter-to-quarter just because how the quality of how people report the data and all that. So there's a lot more volatility from quarter-to-quarter, so we really don't talk about it. We felt very good about where we were across the year and by quarter. And that's really the only thing that I would talk about. 
Operator: Your last question will come from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi. 
Deborah Weinswig: So Rodney, I think you said something really interesting with regards to -- the third quarter tonnage was essentially flat and slightly improving as you ended the year. Was there anything unique that you did at the end of 2011 to improve the tonnage, in your opinion? 
W. McMullen: Nothing more than normal things that you would do. I mean, it really is trying to understand what's connecting and what's not and you modify along the way. But I wouldn't say it was one big, one item that caused it. I really think it's just you continue to learn and just getting a little bit better about on the things you're doing. 
Deborah Weinswig: And then also in the prepared remarks, there was a comment, loyal customers spend about 50% of their food dollars with Kroger and that there was opportunity to grow that. Are there any current initiatives focused specifically on growing that dollar with the loyal customers? 
David Dillon: All of them. Rodney, do you want to add to that? 
W. McMullen: Yes, I mean, I'm not going to be able to be any more insightful than what Dave is. There are a lot of things that we're doing. It really is -- if you think about a football analogy, it's one play at a time. And it's fascinating, those customers would tell us they spend more than what they actually spend with us. And it really is trying to understand each customer segment and what's important to them and delivering better against that. 
Deborah Weinswig: Okay. And then lastly, there was mention with regards to answering one of the questions that there's several technology projects that you're looking at that should be attractive for the long haul. Can you elaborate on what those might be? 
J. Schlotman: Probably wouldn't go into the list of them. But as you know, whenever you get into any kind of technology projects, they typically consume a bit of capital. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate amount allocated and budgeted for that, and it does affect where CapEx winds up coming in. 
David Dillon: Thank you very much. And so before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. Because of your hard work in 2011, it was a big success. We made solid progress in connecting more with our customers, especially by offering better and faster service, and making sure that we have the products our customers want in stock. We worked hard to keep costs under control in ways that are meaningful to the business but not distracting to our customers. And we have successfully reinvested the costs that you saved. Our customers say that they can feel the difference. Thank you and keep up that great work. 
 This week, we invited 38 Kroger associates from across the entire company to join us in Cincinnati for a special celebration. These associates live our values and leadership model in their daily work. Together, this talented group has shown remarkable leadership, innovation and courage, each in his or her own special way. Our honorees this year include managers who lead strong and engaged store teams, associates whose new ideas have made a big difference, community service award winners, the associates who have joined the I Can Do That fitness challenge and made a healthy lifestyle change. We are inspired by their efforts to make our company better. Please help us congratulate and thank these associates. You can learn more about them by watching our quarterly broadcast tomorrow or reading on Great People.me in the coming weeks. That completes the call today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you all for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stacy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2011 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Kroger associates delivered on our Customer 1st strategy in the third quarter. We had strong sales and earnings per share growth. This is exactly the positive momentum we strive for as we enter the holiday season, our most exciting time of the year, and we are very pleased. Keep in mind that a year ago, third quarter earnings were helped by a $0.02 tax benefit and a $50 million lower LIFO charge. In that context, this was an outstanding quarter. Based on the consistency of our results over the course of this year, we have the confidence to raise our earnings and sales guidance for the year. Identical supermarket sales increased 5% without fuel for the quarter. This continues Kroger's industry-leading trend of positive identical sales growth for 32 consecutive quarters. Consistent identical sales growth lets us know that our Customer 1st strategy is connecting with customers in a meaningful way. Our focus on 4 keys, our people, products, prices and shopping experience is how we grow customer loyalty each shopping trip. Positive identical store sales also drive earnings growth as illustrated by our results so far this year. Our third quarter performance was broad-based across the company. Each of our 18 retail divisions had positive identical sales, excluding fuel. Every department achieved positive identical sales as well, led by growth in natural foods, deli and produce. I would like to especially recognize our associates for their excellent work to control costs this quarter. Kroger's financial results are solid, dependable and predictable, especially on a rolling 4-quarter basis. They reflect the balance that we seek between cost savings and investments to consistently grow our business and deliver a value both for our customers and our shareholders. In a few minutes, Rodney will share some additional customer insights with you, including loyal household and tonnage trends, along with the performance of Kroger's exclusive corporate brands. First, I'd like to touch on the 2 themes that we told you at the beginning of the year would influence Kroger's fiscal 2011 financial results. The first is our commitment to the Customer 1st strategy that we just discussed. We want to reduce the overall cost of running our business in ways that do not negatively affect our customers, and then reinvest those savings in our customers to drive higher sales. Higher sales, in turn, produce higher earnings. The second theme includes the external factors that are influencing Kroger's business this year. The pace of the economic recovery, the impact of food and fuel prices on customer spending, the competitive environment, higher pension and healthcare costs and retail fuel margins. Inflation and the economy have had a more negative effect on the overall operating environment than we had originally expected. We have successfully navigated these influences by following our business strategy and making tactical adjustments as needed over the course of the year. Rodney will now offer some more insight into the business for the third quarter. Rodney?
W. Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with the results our Kroger team has achieved in the third quarter. As Dave mentioned, our associates have done an incredible job serving our customers by controlling expenses and cutting costs. We are investing those savings in ways that enhance the shopping experience and help our customers save even as in food inflation persists at high levels. Executing our Customer 1st strategy enables us to deliver value today while continuing to invest for the future. I would like to begin by discussing how our customers are navigating this challenging consumer environment and how that is impacting our business. Despite the consumer caution and rising food prices, Kroger continued to add both loyal and total households in the third quarter, adding loyal households at a faster rate. The combination of growing loyal households and an increase in shopping trips resulted in more units sold to those customers. We are seeing increasing stress on certain customers, both in terms of what they tell us is happening to them and how they are behaving. Smaller baskets are the norm across all customer segments, in line with trends we began detecting in June. Customers are shifting what and how they are buying groceries and consumables. For example, we saw significant growth in sales in our corporate brand items. Some customers are buying smaller pack sizes for items in certain categories.  These changes are a result of customer reaction to the combination of food inflation and a poor economy. When you consider that household income has remained stagnant for the past year, in fact, for the last several number of years, some shifting in purchasing behavior is understandable. This is one of the reasons we embarked upon the strategy we did several years ago. Even though our estimated product cost inflation excluding fuel was approximately 6% for the quarter, we were able to increase our penny profit per item in the grocery category. Mike will say more about how food inflation impacted our gross margins for the quarter. I do want to note that not every single retailer calculates product cost inflation in the same way. Kroger's calculation is weighted to take product movement into account so we can get a better measure of what the true effect on the consumer is over time. We believe 6% accurately reflects what the consumer is in fact, experiencing. Using a calculation that measures inflation at a particular point in time would result in an inflation estimate different than the one we actually calculate. In looking at unit sales, we have seen a continued slowing of the rate of growth of unit movement throughout the year. When considering different promotional activity and changes in pack sizes some customers are buying, we believe our tonnage is essentially flat. We will continue to pass along product cost increases from suppliers. At the same time, we will confidently invest for the future in pricing, people, products and the customer shopping experience. We estimate that we have lowered our customer shopping bill by $2.2 billion per year, and our weekly promotions and personalized rewards to loyal households continue to grow customer loyalty in a difficult economic environment. In the third quarter, more customers chose our exclusive items, which grew Kroger's corporate brand share and sales more than national brands. Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of grocery department sales dollars and 35% of the grocery department units sold. These figures compare with 26% and 34%, respectively, for the third quarter of last year. Considering the consistent share growth of Kroger's corporate brand products for several years, it is obvious that once after customers try them for the first time, they continue to choose them for their great value, both in terms of quality and low price points. Our corporate brand team continues to develop innovative product lines to address unmet customer needs. During the quarter, we launched some great new products for customers looking to change their eating habits, including a 99% natural, zero-calorie baking sweetener that measures cup for cup like sugar. In our bakery department, Kroger's new no sugar added pies, available in apple, cherry, pumpkin and other delicious flavors, are a great option for those on low or no-sugar diet. We also have good progress to report in labor relations. Several previously unsettled labor negotiations have resulted in contracts that have been ratified, including those in Southern California, southeastern Ohio and Charleston West Virginia, along with the Teamsters at one of our distribution centers in Washington State. I'd like to thank our associates and division leadership for their work to reach mutually acceptable agreements.  We are in discussions with the UFCW for Memphis area stores and with the Teamsters for some distribution centers and dairies in the Midwest. These contracts are in extension while negotiations continue. As you know, our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide good wages, high-quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefits for our associates. Now Mike will discuss our third quarter results and Kroger's financial strategy in detail. Mike?
J. Michael Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As we reported earlier today, net earnings for the third quarter totaled $195.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $202 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 34 basis points. Food inflation accounted for most of this decrease. The FIFO gross margin decline was more than offset by a 29-basis point improvement in our OG&A rate excluding fuel, and improvements in rent and depreciation of 19 basis points also excluding fuel. We look at operating margin on a rolling 4 quarters basis because tactical adjustments to the strategy can have a positive or negative impact from one quarter to the next. On this basis, excluding fuel, the operating margin expanded by 5 basis points. This is the third consecutive rolling 4-quarter period with an expanded operating margin. This calculation of operating profit is on a LIFO basis, meaning that the calculation includes the LIFO charge. During the quarter, our estimate of this year's LIFO charge increased $35 million, from $150 million to $185 million. To get LIFO caught up year-to-date, we had an incremental $27 million charge over what we had budgeted in the third quarter. Excluding the LIFO charge from the calculation, our rolling 4 quarters operating profit increased 21 basis points. Due to the increase in our LIFO estimate, we expect the operating profit margin on a LIFO basis to show a slight decline for the year. But on a FIFO basis, it will show a slight increase. The reduction of 29 basis points in OG&A without fuel demonstrates the leverage of our strong identical food store sales and cost control efforts in the face of rising debit and credit card fees, pension and healthcare expenses. Also as a result of current expected operating performance for the year, our incentive plans are estimated to pay off at a higher rate than last year. Collectively, debit and credit card fees, pension, healthcare and incentive plans have increased 45 basis points, with incentive plans being the largest of these. Kroger's retail fuel operations in the third quarter earned approximately $0.137 per gallon compared to $0.127 per gallon in the same quarter last year. For the last quarter of the year, we expect margins of approximately $0.115 per gallon. Given the trend in higher credit and debit card fees, earnings from fuel were essentially flat compared to last year. And the cents per gallon margin after debit and credit card fees was also essentially flat. I'll now update you on our long-term financial strategy. We are very focused on allocating the substantial cash flow of Kroger's business to reward our shareholders, both today and in the future. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. During 2011, Kroger is using cash flow from operations and cash-on-hand to repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders, fund capital expenditures and maintain our current debt rating. During the quarter, we leveraged Kroger's strong cash flow to invest $471.2 million to repurchase 21 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.39. At the end of the third quarter, approximately $721 million -- $721.6 million remain under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in September of 2011. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $497 million for the third quarter compared with $484 million in the same period last year. We expect capital investment for the year to be slightly above $1.9 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We also saw a strong improvement in the EBITDA return on net operating assets, or ERONOA, of 19.68%, an increase of 108 basis points from a year ago. Net total debt was $7.7 billion, an increase of $476.6 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio adjusted for the impairment charges in 2010 was 1.89 compared with 1.93 during the same period last year. As we reported earlier this morning, Kroger's increased its fiscal 2011 guidance. We now expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 4.5% to 5% for the year. Previously identical supermarket sales were expected to range from 4% to 5%. We are also increasing the range of our net earnings guidance to $1.95 to $2 per share -- diluted share for the year. Previously, we expected net earnings in the $1.85 to $1.95 range.  We are in the middle of our business planning process. Based on what we're seeing today, we expect to reach 8% to 10% annual earnings per share growth in 2012, plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2%. This does not factor in the 53rd week in fiscal 2012. As you know, our long-term growth model was to generate 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will provide full guidance in March but thought it would be helpful for you to know how we currently see 2012 shaping up.  Now I'll turn it back to Dave.
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Mike. I'd like to conclude by reflecting that when we began our Customer 1st strategy, we had to make investments in price and other areas of the shopping experience. Those choices were an imperative. And while we still see opportunity to continue these investments, today we have the flexibility to pick and choose how and when to do so. I mentioned at the start of the call that our financial results are solid, dependable and predictable, especially on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Looking at Kroger's operating margin on that longer time horizon demonstrates this powerful positioning. A rolling 4-quarter view is important because we are constantly making tactical decisions about these investments. Our margin in any one quarter may fluctuate depending on our decision to accelerate or decelerate investments. But if you look under the hood at our operating margin over the course of a year, you'll see that the results reflect the strategic balance we seek between cost savings and investment that we believe are necessary to consistently deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. I'm very proud of this year. I'm personally proud of what our associates have achieved. Kroger is winning in the marketplace and delivering value for our customers, associates and shareholders. We have a great strategy that has worked well in a variety of economic environments. That gives us the confidence to be bullish on the rest of this year and 2012. Now we look forward to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Kroger (sic) [Citigroup].
Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Actually with Citigroup. So David, you talked about the inflation the economy have had a more negative impact than expected and that you've made tactical adjustments. I don't know if you could maybe enlighten us and expand on those?
David B. Dillon: Well, the point really is to look at what's happening with our customers. And we knew all along in the year that the real issue would be how does the world -- the operating world that our customers find themselves in, the macroenvironment that affects everyone, how will that affect us. And what has happened is that the intersection of inflation, which means higher prices for the customer, and a poor economy, which means the customer doesn't have as much money in their pocket. Those 2 factors together have caused at Kroger and I think elsewhere and many of the CPG companies, as retail prices have gone up, tonnage, the growth in tonnage, has declined a bit to where, as we've said now, as our tonnage last quarter was essentially flat. And we think that's essentially a sign of our times. And it's because when customers have to spend more money to get the groceries they need, they don't have money to buy more groceries than they were buying before. So it's hard to keep the business growing in tonnage in that kind of environment. So if I look at any issue in the quarter, to me that's the macro issue that all of us are trying to deal with. The really good news and the thing I'm most pleased about is that even in the face of that, we ended up growing households, we ended up growing our business, we ended up growing our earnings per share. And so we're thrilled by that outcome, and we're thrilled in that environment that our strategy has produced such solid results.
Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And as we look down the road, what are you hearing from suppliers in terms of cost inflation? How do you think about 2012?
David B. Dillon: I'm going to let Mike comment a little bit on that, but we've seen, as you know, there's a lag between what we see in the commodity markets and what we see in the actual pricing that we receive and then what gets passed on at retail. And because for several quarters, we predicted higher inflation but it didn't happen. And then when it did happen, of course, it's been pretty strong inflation for the last several quarters. So looking forward, Mike, do you have some comments?
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes. I -- Deb, I think in the first half, we would expect inflation to continue close to where it is today. Keep in mind that we didn't really start to see a huge uptick in inflation until late in the second quarter and it's obviously continued in the third quarter. It kind of grew throughout the first half of the year. So we'll be lapping that when we get into 2012. If you look at basic commodities, corn and wheat are down a little bit but still well above the 5-year moving average. And I don't think there's been enough movement in those to actually think about having price declines. But I think there could price stabilization when we get to the back half of 2012.
Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then last question just in terms of tonnage growth. Obviously, you guys have done an incredible job. Just when do you think we'll start to see that pickup, if you have -- if you can take out your crystal ball out of your pocket?
David B. Dillon: Well, I don't think I have a crystal ball on that. We do expect, given how our performance has been earlier this year, that even in this environment, we expect to do well. But the concern I have, of course, is as customers are pressed, and we talked about inflation. But the other factor that I think is the -- maybe the most important factor is what the economic environment going to look like to our customers. And that can put a dampening or an accelerating effect on how customers view their future and their own behavior. So we try to measure behavior. We try to react to that. You asked earlier about what kind of adjustments do we make. Well, we look at what consumer behavior looks like, and we try to focus on what can we do on behalf of the consumers at this point in time given what they're trying to live with. I think that's the biggest unknown is what that economy is going to look like. And so far, it's going to stay soft for quite a while.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: David, if you could talk a little bit about maybe expand, as you look out to 2012, how you see the economic environment particularly since there may be a possibility here that unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut does not get extended come January 1. Do you think it's a -- is it possibly a tougher macro in 2012 or about -- maybe it's the same? And then kind of what goes along with that when you think about the 8% to 10% comp earnings growth, will the comp be lower next year than this year or do you think that would be close or the same?
David B. Dillon: Well, I'll answer the last question first. I don't think we're going to try to give full guidance today so we're not going to answer that question. But I will talk a little bit about how we see the environment going forward. The bottom line in my mind is, is that we expect next year, at least the foreseeable part of next year, to be much like what we've seen this year from an economic point of view. There are 2 kinds of big factors that I think about in my own thinking on this question. First, what do the facts mean, and factually, how does the economy behave? And I think everything I've seen suggests that, that's going to be slow. I don't see it as crashing and burning, but on the other hand, I also don't see it as robust and climbing. So we see that as relatively flat. But the other factor that we don't talk a lot about usually gets played out is consumer confidence. And I think it really is more specifically looked at and what are the events that occur during the year that cause people to feel either good or bad about the world that they operate in which affect their behavior? And consumer behavior and confidence can have a lot to do with whether or not an economy can pick up or not. And it has a lot to do with how our business does. So we're very interested in how our consumers are feeling. They get affected by lots of things. We talked last quarter about how they had been affected by the debt crisis discussion in Congress and how that got played out in such a wild way in the media. Well, we're expecting a replay of something like that soon. And that could have a similar kind of effect. On the other hand, there's lots of positive optimistic things out there today, and if those get played up in a way that the customers see them and feel good about the world, then that part of the economic action actually is an improvement. Having said all of that, that's how I think about it. I think ultimately, we think it's going to be about the same as this year with high variability just like we experienced this year.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: As a follow-up to that, I mean, we've had I think you'd agree, this year has been remarkably stable in terms of competitive rationality. People have done the right things, not made many stupid mistakes. I guess in your forecast, do you see that continuing or is there a risk that as the macro stays soft, that we see some reversion back to more intense promotions and dumb decisions?
David B. Dillon: I can't speak, obviously, for competitors and wouldn't pretend to. But my answer from our point of view is yes. I think it's been a more rational marketplace. I think it's gradually been a more rational marketplace over the last 10 or 15 years based on what the economic forces are rather than based on emotion. And I think that everyone seems to be taking steps that make more economic sense. And certainly, we strive to do that at Kroger. Our whole point of view is to make rational choices that make sense for the long-term success of our business. And that's why I think you've seen our rational behavior, and I think that's probably why you've seen it elsewhere, too. So yes, I expect that to continue.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division: And just one final thing. If you think about the ongoing need to make price investments, where do you see the best opportunities to take cost out going forward? And I assume it's in the store. Is it, what -- you may not be specific, but as you look at processes, is that sort of the biggest opportunity to take stuff out of receiving front end, those kind of areas or is it something else?
David B. Dillon: I'll let Rodney specifically comment, but let me generally comment by saying that we're interested in taking cost out of places that either don't matter to the customer or perhaps actually improve things for the customer. And we're also interested in things that can be high dollars, so those are often things that are in the stores because you multiply that times 2,500 or it can be in our distribution processes because you multiply that times all the items that go through the system. Having said that, Rodney, you might want to add a little more specificity.
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, yes. Obviously, we're not -- we won't be able to give specifics. But one of the things that we worked awfully hard is to try to get ideas across from the whole organization because we have awful lot of fabulous associates across the whole company. And then making sure that we could facilitate our process where we execute against those across the company. And what we've found over time is when you think you've got all the savings you can, that you know about, smart people come up with other ideas on how to make processes chain improve, as you mentioned. So we feel very confident that we've got a whole litany of lists of ideas to continue to improve the customers' experience and take costs out of our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I want to get back to this issue on tonnage. Your tonnage is relatively flat, but it's down almost everywhere else out there, and I guess that's because of elasticity and a lot of your competition is showing fairly sizable declines. Are they okay in this situation where they're seeing negative tonnage? Do they just look at the top line and say, "Okay, my top line is getting a little bit better so I won't be more promotional?" What's the mindset as tonnage goes to negative at your competition?
David B. Dillon: I don't know about their mindset. My mindset is that I see the economy has changed. Customers only have so much money. And when you take 6% more of their money from higher prices, they have 6% less to spend on other things. And that's not to mention that fuel is a little bit higher this year, too, which if you haven't filled up the car lately, you haven't experienced it. But you'll find that it takes more money out of your available spending. And when that happens, there's only so much to give. And when that happens, you shouldn't chase. We can't. We don't try to chase the customer in that environment. You can't get them to spend money they don't have. So we're -- I think we're rational about that and I think that the market is rational about that, too. It does help that the sales are positive for nearly every retailer, and even those that aren't, they're close to positive. And that helps because that helps make ends meet. It helps you pay the bills. And as long as you can pay the bills, then you can continue to work down the path of rational operating behavior, which is what I think we have.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: As we think about next year as inflation, let's say, it begins to ease in the back of the year, tonnage at some point probably starts to come back but my guess is there is some delay in that. So I guess, one, do you agree with that? And then two, that would mean that IDs, just mathematically, probably has -- have to at least slow a little bit. Does that make sense?
David B. Dillon: I'm not going to speculate on how that will end up playing out. I think that actually will be played out. In fact, we'll know the answer to that when we see the facts. And partially because if I were to answer that, it's starting to try to lock in on guidance for sales next year, which I don't plan to do today.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Actually I don't mean to ask you like that. I guess, my real question is that we're in a situation where back half of next year, let's say, your IDs are up, I mean, I don't know 3.5% because you've got less inflation rolling through about maybe modestly better tonnage. As an organization, how do you manage your business differently at all based on that decelerating ID?
David B. Dillon: Oh, we probably would manage the business a little bit differently, but I'd be pleased with a picture that was a growing tonnage like that because it would spell a healthier picture. But even in this environment where our tonnage is flat, we feel we're growing our market share a little, not as fast as maybe we were before, but that's the environment we're in. So you can grow. What we're mostly interested in is winning with households, and whether that is winning with households at flat tonnage or winning with households at positive tonnage, I probably would prefer positive tonnage. But on the whole, it's still winning. And we end up having a really bright future if we win in market share. As you know, that's more our formula, than not everybody requires market share to be successful. But our market share really is helpful to us.
Edward J. Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And just last question for you, there's been a lot of talk about Walmart recently because, I guess, they've quantified what they're going to do from a pricing standpoint at their analyst meeting. You seeing anything different there at all?
David B. Dillon: I don't think I'll comment specifically on what we're seeing at Walmart or really any other competitor. We watch them all very closely as they watch us very closely. I'll leave that up to you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have a couple of questions. I'd like to talk -- you've mentioned that penny profit was up in the dry grocery category, which is really good to hear. I was wondering if you could talk about whether you see differences in the nature of the categories where you see the penny profit up? Is it that there are some categories that customers will accept the price increase and others they won't? Or is it more across the board?
W. Rodney McMullen: That's a great question, Meredith. The -- as you know, if you look at the perishable departments or the fresh departments, that is as much driven by what's going on in the competitive environment and how long do you think the inflation is there. So that, you'll see a lot more increase in -- or decline in pennies profit per item that may or may not align with the inflation. In grocery, we see much more predictability and we're seeing predictability so far this year, and Drug GM also. So I would really kind of separate the 2, and we actually -- you see a little bit different behavior in both areas. But one is really affected as much by the competition.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I think there was a little bit of a question about CPG, but just maybe if you could elaborate a little bit. You have said all along that you would pass along the increases and they would have to make a decision how they felt about their volume being down or managing their gross margins. Are you seeing any change at this point? Are they increasing their promotional funding? Are they holding back do you think on any of the increases they're passing through to you?
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, the thing that we don't really know about what the CPG is how they've hedged their raw materials. As a general rule, we would see them holding back in terms of what the cost come through versus the inflation of the raw materials. But in a lot of cases, we would assume that they've hedged that so they probably haven't had the cost increase the same as what you would read in the marketplace. So as a general rule, we would see lagging there. Not necessarily a lot on promotion, no different than a year ago. You'll constantly see somebody feel like they're losing share a little bit and they'll come and be more aggressive with promotion dollars. They like a specific promotion, those kinds of things, but nothing really not huge change there.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I'd just like to ask you about your labor negotiations. I just wondered if there are any themes that you can draw from all of the negotiations you've done, say, in the last 12 months. Healthcare clearly is an issue. Pension is an issue. But sort of how is it working out? And are there concessions being made on the wages to get keep healthcare and pension benefits?
W. Rodney McMullen: In terms of -- if you look broadly the 2 that you raised, obviously, every negotiation, healthcare and pension is a very critical part of that negotiation. If you look at wages, wage increases are not as much as what a lot of the increase ends up going in pension and healthcare where some -- where our associates receive versus the cash wage. But as a general rule, our cash wage increase also goes up when you look at in the basket. Now our associates are working together with us on changes in work rules. As we've talked about before, constantly changing processes, everything else, so that you try to balance all those things out. And so far, we feel pretty good that we've been able to have negotiations where we have competitive costs, but at the same time, we have an excellent benefit package and solid wages versus the market. So far, we feel good about where we've ended up. Now that road of getting there isn't always so smooth, as what I just outlined.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: If you could just touch on the produce topic in a bit more detail. I think we all know the dry food prices are probably going up next year. But on the perishable side of things, is there any cost release coming there in your view over the next 3 to 6 months period?
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes. I mean, if you look at the perishables, if you look at like produce, it's really hard to predict because it really depends on what kind of growing seasons do you have, both in Mexico and California and Florida. So today, we don't see anything unusual, but you can have a freeze tomorrow that changes that comment. So it's really hard to say there. On meat, we would expect to continue to see inflation because of the things that Mike talked about. If you look at like corn, especially the -- it's lower than what it was, but still, when you look at year-on-year, it's a tremendous increase. So we would expect in meat to just continue to see some of those cost pressures there. Dairy, probably not quite as inflationary as it was, but that's also highly volatile based on how the weather is and how much the supply of milk is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.
Mike Otway - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Just, I guess, stepping back a little bit. Last quarter -- I know you've touched upon this probably a little bit, but last quarter, you seemed a bit more cautious in pulling forward some of the price investment. Now with the raised guidance, it appears there's some more optimism. And just kind of want to get a sense for what may have changed between the third quarter and the second quarter and what may be causing that optimism?
David B. Dillon: I think if anything changed, I don't really think a lot changed. But if anything changed in my mind, it's we've seen more of the environment. What we saw looking down the road last quarter was an environment that was increasingly looking difficult for the consumer. And the question was how well would we be able to get through that with higher prices and would the customers stay with us? And the fact that we have grown households in that environment, loyal households have grown at a good clip compared to total. But total is up as well, but loyals are the ones we're most interested in. The fact that we've been able to do that and to make ends meet really well suggests to us that in this environment, we can be successful. And so we're very pleased and proud with what we accomplished, and it helps to be able to look back now and say, "Okay, we made it through that pretty well. We can work in an environment like this and make it successful." So I think if there's anything about attitude, that's how my attitude shifted. We went from the unknown to the known.
J. Michael Schlotman: I'd just add a couple of comments to David's comments. Part of the optimism, I would say, is more -- is driven by some of the things we did in the second quarter and how the customers reacted to that. The other thing is our strong free cash flow we've been able to buy back more shares than what we had originally planned to do. And that obviously helps earnings going forward too. So it's really both of those things together.
Mike Otway - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess, just a small housekeeping item on the tax rate. It was a little lower than I think the kind of 36.5% guidance in the back half, and I know there's always moving parts, but any color there?
J. Michael Schlotman: I would say there is nothing -- no one big item would have caused it to be slightly different. And we gave guidance for what to expect for the year in the 8-K, as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Todd Duvick - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I want to ask about your financial policy and balance sheet, if I may. You may have heard that one of your competitors started down the path of a mini leveraged recap yesterday, and as a result, its credit rating was downgraded. That company's leverage is going up on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis while yours is flat to down. And Mike, I think early on the call, you mentioned an objective of maintaining your debt rating. So with that backdrop. I wanted to know, can you provide updated thoughts on how you plan to allocate capital in the near term and really what governs your share buyback appetite?
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes, good question, Todd. As I've said in the prepared remarks, we do expect to continue to use our free cash flow and balance the use of that between buying in shares, paying the dividend, strong capital expenditure program and maintaining our current BBB flat credit rating. We like to have the access to the A2/P2 commercial paper market. It's very deep and very liquid and very attractive rates to allow us to finance our needs on an overnight basis when we have those needs. And we will continue to expect to manage our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to stay under 2x, which we think is a good proxy for the way the rating agencies calculate our leverage. We think if we use that target, it transfers into the leverage ratio that the rating agencies will be comfortable giving us a BBB flat.
Todd Duvick - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, also, you have an $850 million in debt maturing in the first half of 2012. Can we expect you to refinance most or all of that closer to the time of maturity?
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes, about half of that comes due in April and the other half in June. And we would expect to, at this point, to refinance that sometime early next year. We've already, as you may have seen in our second quarter 10-Q, entered into a series of interest rate, of forward-starting swaps to lock in some of the interest rates as some of the 10-year and -- 10- and 30-year treasury. Those days where they have taken a dip, we've been active on locking in some of those in a forward-starting swap basis to take some of our exposure to rates between now and then off the table.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.
Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You talked a little bit about customers buying smaller pack sizes, seeing that across categories. But Heinz talked a couple of weeks ago they wanted to introduce a greater number of these packages but they were a little bit late versus their own expectations in doing so. Is this something you're experiencing that you want to fill your shelves with more of these reduced size items, maybe can't get them yet from manufacturers? Or are you happy with what you're receiving? And I guess along this line, can you help us understand a bit better in which categories consumers are looking for these smaller sizes, whether or not maybe where the strategy is effective or it's less so? Just hoping to get some color because it is a little bit of a sea change in how consumers are shopping.
David B. Dillon: Well, actually, what we're seeing is actually people shifting pack sizes, not just to smaller but also to larger depending on the item and the situation. So it's really customer-specific and customer-need specific. Rodney, you may have some comments to the rest of the question, though.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes. Well, in terms of specifics, every category is different. So literally, you'd have to go through a hundred different categories for the answer. Whether we pick up an item or not, as you know, is really based on our belief in what customers tell us is important to them. So if they come up with something that we think the customer would want, we'll add it. If they don't, we won't. If you look in our own corporate brand categories, you'll find some items we've moved to smaller packs. Other items, we've actually moved to bigger packs. And it really -- it is category-specific.
Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then you've had the lead in consumer insights for years in grocery, and obviously, you do a great job with that. Some of your competitors, though, have spoken lately about getting better at this. So I'm just curious if you're seeing anything interesting in the marketplace in terms of other supermarkets benefiting more from loyalty cards or personal e-mails than they previously did, anything like that? I know you don't have specific insights but maybe how it's affecting you, if at all, or maybe nothing's changed as for as you can tell?
David B. Dillon: Everybody wants to get better than they are at this as we do, and we expect to improve just as they're expecting to improve. I don't think I'll speculate on what their success has been.
W. Rodney McMullen: The only other thing, Dave, I would add is that we're working really hard to make sure that we have that next generation of what's being done. We started doing some personalized offers and pricing 4 or 5 years ago. There's all kinds of things we're doing that's really the next version of that and in making it even better for our customers. So we're not standing still either, and we've always assumed our competitors will keep getting better.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: I'd like to ask a little bit about your pharmacy operations, how that's been tracking and are you happy with it? And are you doing anything there to tie it into the customer loyalty strategies?
David B. Dillon: If you look at pharmacy, we're just delighted with our trend and where we are. Obviously, there's a lot of things going on in the marketplace at the moment. In terms of using loyalty, that's something that, yes, we are working hard on improving, how to use loyalty data for the benefit of our customers. They are just like we are in every department. One other thing that I'm sure you know, if you look at -- as you look out to 2012, there's a lot of major drugs that will be moving to generics that will affect sales in that department. But gross profit rate will be helpful. But there's a lot of change going on right now in pharmacy as you know. We're very pleased with the quarter that we had and the trend that we're on.
Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: You do any gas rewards tied to the pharmacy? I don't recall, but I think you do.
David B. Dillon: That would be correct. We do. Get your prescription refilled at Kroger and you can see how it works.
Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Open some stores here, Dave. How about gasoline profitability, just looking at that compared to a year ago and the most recent quarter?
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes, if you look at gasoline profitability, it was the dollars were essentially exactly flat so it didn't help that it didn't hurt the quarter on a year-on-year basis. The reported cents per gallon margin that we talked about was up. But when you reduce that margin for the debit and credit card fees, because they go up as the retails go up, that margin was essentially flat.
Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And finally, what did Thanksgiving business tell you about the customer?
David B. Dillon: Well, let me give you sort of an update just through the quarter, the fourth quarter. We have, what, 3.5 weeks I think in this quarter behind us, and our identical sales have been consistent with where they were in the third quarter. And we would say Thanksgiving was at least that good. We were very pleased at the Thanksgiving holiday, because Thanksgiving is embedded in those numbers. But we're pleased. I don't think I can give you much more details than that but that will give you a sense that the quarter's starting out certainly in the right direction.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: First thing just on your next year's guidance. The 8% to 10% excluding the extra week, just curious what's driving the higher rate because you've obviously been fairly committed to the 6% to 8% rate for a while? And then, I guess, the second part of that is can you maybe just remind us what the impact on -- EPS impact was from the extra week last time you had a 53-week year?
J. Michael Schlotman: Part of the reason that we think next year will be a little bit higher, we think the base operations will perform in a similar fashion to this year. But it's really the benefit of the higher share buyback this year and the carryover effect of that next year. You don't only get the benefit that you can buy the shares, you get some next year, and it's recognition of that. Relative to the extra week, we will give you guidance on what we think the extra week is worth in March because I don't want to go back to what it was last time because every year is different. We have to look at which week the Super Bowl falls in and things like that before you really do it. And I frankly am not that far into the 53rd week yet.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's fair. And then I know you're trying to veer us away from this but can you talk -- can you give us the selling gross margin trends in the quarter?
David B. Dillon: Well, we're not going to give the specific number but it was gently improved from where we were last quarter is about all I guess we'd say at this point.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then looking at your sales trends, I guess, throughout the quarter and then now into the first few weeks of this quarter, you were kind of running -- I mean, you said you're kind of running in line with your second quarter results for the first few weeks of the third quarter so that was kind of a 5-3 type of number. Can you talk about this trend throughout the quarter? And then it would seem that at least when you look at the 2-year trend for the first 3.5 weeks of the fourth quarter, your ID has reaccelerated. So maybe just us a little color there?
David B. Dillon: Well, first, let me go back to the selling gross just for a second to make sure I said that in a way that's understood. When I said it's slightly improved from last quarter, what I meant was, as you would look at it, the amount of the investment we made last quarter and selling gross in the second quarter, it was a little less investment in the third quarter.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right, that is what I figured. Okay.
David B. Dillon: I just want to make sure I explained it right. As for sales trends for the quarter, it was -- the quarter itself was basically consistent. Of course, we have several ups and downs, but I don't -- I can't see a pattern that I think would be useful to describe here. And in what I said about Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving was at least as good as where the trends were but which meant it would have been a good week, a good solid week. But I wouldn't characterize it as noticeably higher than, say, the trend in the third quarter. So I'd say the fourth quarter started out pretty much like the third quarter's average was, is what I meant to say. I hope that's what I said.
Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that makes sense. And then on the operating expenses this quarter, they seemed fairly encouraging. Anything to point to there and what was driving that?
David B. Dillon: Yes, they were encouraging, and even more encouraging when you realize the -- what was it, 45 basis points that we had to overcome on the incentive plan, the healthcare, the pension and credit and debit card fees, that made it even a stronger result. Nothing like strong sales to help, that's really important. But perhaps the most important is the attitude of the whole organization. Our associates are really focused on how they can reduce cost because they recognize, and that's why we repeat so often what our business strategy is. They recognize that the objective of lower costs is to fund investments in things that matter to the customer, which goes to produce more jobs for our employees, increased hours we're running on average in our stores, more hours per week used in labor this year than we used last year for the same time period. And that's a really positive trend. And that's because we're finding places to save in order to invest. So I think that attitude, the empowerment of our associates has probably driven that more than almost anything else.  Rodney, anything to add to that? Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.
Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on an earlier question. I'm not asking here about Walmart or any other competitors, pricing or execution in the marketplace. I'm asking specifically here about expansion plans and total square footage dedicated to your food retailing coming into your territories. It seems like several alternate retailers, hard discounters, you name it, are expanding. It seems like consumer that's a little bit more constrained is getting more creative about the places where they shop, particularly at the low end, and others are expanding assortments. And just wondering if you did any thinking about that and if you could put a number on, over the past year or the past couple of years, how much more capacity, if you will, has come into your markets and whether that's accelerating or decelerating right now?
David B. Dillon: We won't be putting a number on it, but I'll just tell you these 2 background points that may be helpful for your thinking about this. First, one of the trends that we saw 10 years ago, and it's certainly clear today, is the fragmenting of where people buy food. It's no longer -- and it hasn't been for many years now, no longer just in supermarkets. And if you look at where food is purchased, you can see that is obvious. And so that trend continues and that plays into a little of what you're describing. And second is that we see in every market, and have seen this in every year, changes that are always happening. It's a dynamic kind of business. And we look at it on a local market basis and what's happening in each market and we try to react in those markets. And so certainly you can describe markets where what you're saying is happening. But you can also describe markets where that's not happening. And so I would have to say that every year is different, every market is different. Rodney, do you want to add to that?
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes, the only thing I would add is we're finding in some situations the competitors when they open up, our estimates would show they take a lot more volume from their own stores than what we would have necessarily seen in the past. And there is a point where there's a certain amount of customers like to shop a certain store or format. But it's not 100% of customers want to shop a certain type of store. So we are seeing that. The other thing we're also seeing is competitors continue to fall out too. It's just the profile of those is not high as the ones that people open up.
Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: What do you think -- just as a follow-up, what do you think needs to happen for that to slow down or stop? I mean, it seems like everybody in the industry is -- I don't think anyone in the industry is saying it's great out there. Even some of the faster-growing small and limited assortment players, so you've -- what do you think needs to happen to convince people or make them unable or unwilling to grow their commitment to compete with established players like yourself?
David B. Dillon: Well, I think we've said before it's a rational market place. And if you were to look at just at Kroger, for instance, what drives our thinking is what happens with the actual results. And so the question you're asking is if the results at the return on capital and assets doesn't end up paying the bill, in your experience, then you change your course. So I think what you see over -- if you'd go over a 10- or 20-year period of time, most retailers' behavior change is based on what they're actual experiences have been. Now they sometimes have to go learn that lesson the hard way by getting in the market and discovering that, hey, this doesn't work or that didn't work. But they, eventually all of us, learn those lessons and change our behavior when that happens. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Given the tonnage was up a little in Q2 and flat in this quarter and the gross margin got better, is it fair to take away from that, that the penny profit per item, not only was positive, but was -- the rate was better this quarter than last quarter? And if so, what's driving that? Is that pricing being passed through into the market? There's rationality and just sort of retail pricing market-wide catching up to the previously -- the inflation in product costs? Or is it just something Kroger rationing back because from -- in Q3 from Q2?
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes. Penny profit per item would be slightly higher in the third quarter than the second quarter. As Dave mentioned before, we certainly see the market being very rational out there. Tomorrow, that could change. But so far, what we're seeing is very rational. I wouldn't say it's so much of a Kroger change as -- it's the whole market needing to continue to make sure that the costs we get, we go ahead and pass that through.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. So then when I look at the guidance for the year, you bumped up the high end of earnings per share to $2 by $0.05, but you didn't take up the high end of same-store sales. So staying on the same theme, unless there's something going on in your cost structure or what have you, and you -- it would seem to me it's more about the marketplace rationality and given the consumer is not in great shape, nevertheless, is still accepting some further price increases and that it's fair to say retail pricing market-wide is, to some extent, still catch -- doing a better job of catching up to the inflation in product pricing.
David B. Dillon: I think it is. I think that's true really across the market that we see, generally speaking, prices are following the cost increases.
Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division: And am I right that -- and this is the last follow-up, that, that's essentially mainly what's embedded in the way the guidance increase shaped up?
J. Michael Schlotman: I think, Andy, it's just a matter of we now know what third quarter was. Our guidance for the third quarter was we've expected it to be one of our softer quarters of the year because of the tax benefit last year. We actually were able to post a very strong third quarter. And where you look -- you look at where we are year-to-date of $1.50 and what we think we can generate in the fourth quarter given how we performed so far this year, that's your -- just where the world shakes out. You're right, we didn't raise the high end of our ID sales guidance, but starting out at 5%, that's a pretty strong trend and it's delivered the $1.50 so far this year and we expect it to be able to continue to deliver for the balance of the year.
David B. Dillon: Thank you. And so before we end the call today, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. We encourage them to listen.  You may recall that in November, Kroger was named the most generous company in America by Forbes Magazine. This is a great honor for our company, and each of you is responsible for having made it happen. Thank you for caring so much about the communities that -- in which we live and work.  Wherever we operate, our associates seek out ways to support the local charities and organizations that matter most to them and to our customers. Looking at cash alone, for example, in 2010, Kroger donated $64 million to charitable initiatives. Nomination of corporate and retail division contributions, our community rewards program and funds from vendors in our "Bringing Hope to the Table" and "Giving Hope a Hand" campaigns. That figure is much higher when you add in the food and product we donate to local communities. It's closer to $200 million for 2010. On the whole, Kroger donates the equivalent of 125 meals a year to local food banks -- 125 million meals to the local food banks. Even more impressive is your personal commitment and donation of your time as volunteers to support our neighbors in need. Whether you organize a local fund raising event, volunteer at a food bank or help deliver holiday meals to families, you make a difference. So special thanks to all of you.  In today's environment, the role we are playing in our communities is more important than perhaps ever before. We just talked about the stress that so many Americans are under and that includes many of our associates. Now is the time of the year they need our help most.  Finally, we thank our associates who work so hard throughout the holidays to keep our stores open and stocked for our customers. I hope each of you also celebrate the season with your family and friends. As one of our associates added to the blog this week, as retailers especially at holiday time, many of us made Kroger a part of our family. It's true for many of you as it is for me. So it is personal for me to say to each of you individually, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.  That completes the call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: We thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude your presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Janita, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Cindy Holmes: Thank you, Janita. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one topic with one question and one follow-up question if necessary.  Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger second quarter 2011 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We are pleased with Kroger's strong performance this quarter, which we believe is the outcome of our consistent approach to managing the business and executing our Customer 1st strategy. Our ongoing investments in the 4 keys, or people, products, prices and shopping experience, continue to enhance our connection with customers and drive positive identical sales growth.  Identical supermarket sales for the second quarter increased 5.3%, excluding fuel. This is Kroger's 31st consecutive quarter of positive identical sales growth. These industry-leading results are due to the efforts of our associates to delight our customers while at the same time, delivering good savings on expenses.  Kroger's second quarter performance was broad based across the country and supermarket departments. Each of our 18 retail divisions produced positive identical sales growth, excluding fuel. Every supermarket department also experienced positive identical sales growth in the quarter with the strongest increases in natural foods, deli bakery, produce and meat.  Overall, the second quarter results reflect the balance we strive for in our business. We want to consistently deliver value to both our customers and shareholders. Despite the stagnant economy, our sales grew, tonnage remained positive and both total and loyal household counts are up. Fuel performed better and we maintained good cost control.  In keeping with those solid measures of our performance, we also delivered earnings and earnings per share growth right in line with our internal expectations. In March and again in June, we discussed 5 external factors that are shaping the overall operating environment this year. I'd like to briefly update you on how we're managing our business in the context of these 5 factors.  First, the sluggish economy continues to strain household budgets while increasing consumer anxiety. In fact, customers tell us their expectation for the economy are more pessimistic now than at any time this year. And for the first time, customers list instability of the financial markets as one of the top economic concerns. These examples illustrate how consumer sentiment changed during the quarter and are important because most discretionary spending is based on what people feel or perceive about the economy.  Second, food and fuel prices increased again this quarter. In June, Rodney noted that we were beginning to detect slight changes in consumer behavior due to the increased variability of the economy and food inflation. We read this shifting sentiment correctly, which played out this quarter. Our market share continues to grow as we benefit from the credit customers give us for the investments we've made and continue to make to lower the overall pricing of items in our stores. Rodney will have more to say about how food inflation is affecting shopping behavior shortly.  Third, the overall competitive retail environment is rational and our price check show that most competitors are passing higher costs onto consumers, particularly in the center of the store. There are some exceptions to this. One example is produce. During the quarter, retails did not rise at the same pace as costs because of the shortages in product due to the late growing season.  Fourth, in the last quarter, we told you we expected to see an increase in pension and healthcare costs for this year. The increase will be slightly less than originally projected, but remains a significant challenge.  And finally, during the second quarter, our retail fuel operations generated higher earnings per share compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our business and as you know, has a high level of variability.  We'll continue to follow our business strategy and make adjustments as needed to manage these factors which, along with our commitment to Customer 1st strategy, are having the most impact on our business over the course of this year. The goal of our Customer 1st strategy is to consistently reduce the overall cost of running our business, and do it in a way that does not negatively impact our customers. And then reinvest those savings in our customers to drive higher sales, which in turn will increase earnings. Our strategy generated positive momentum and financial results that met our goals in the second quarter.  Rodney will now offer some insight into Kroger's business trends this quarter. Rodney?
Unknown Executive: Thank you, Dave. And good morning, everyone. The customer is going through a lot of change right now, and we are doing everything we can to minimize the impact on them of higher food costs. Dave just discussed how we are working our strategy in the context of the broader operating environment. Associates are working hard to cut cost and we are finding ways to help customers save even as product cost increases are passed on. We estimate we have lowered our customer's shopping bill by $2.1 billion per year. Also in keeping with our strategy, as it became clear during the quarter that the $0.05 earnings per share tax benefit was coming, we accelerated several investments in our 4 keys.  Looking at quarter and year-to-date results, we have made many investments to deliver value today and invest for the future. One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. Loyal household growth is also a convincing indicator of the strength of our Customer 1st strategy because our best customers are the primary beneficiaries of the investments we are making in our 4 keys.  For the quarter, our loyal household count grew at a faster rate than total household growth, which is also up for the quarter. Similarly, we achieved positive identical sales for both total household and loyal households. Identical sales growth among loyal households was stronger than the total household result.  While customers visited our stores slightly more often this quarter, they are purchasing smaller baskets on each visit. Price per unit was higher in the second quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting the effect of price increases from our vendors. I'll talk a bit more about how we're managing through that in a few minutes.  Sequential improvement in identical sales was driven primarily by the combination of more households and higher price per unit. Kroger saw a slightly positive tonnage growth for the quarter compared to last year. This is significant in light of the factors Dave discussed earlier and the trend towards smaller baskets for the quarter. We continue to balance tonnage growth with the pass-through of higher product costs.  In the second quarter, corporate brands share grew more than national brands. Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of grocery department sales dollars and 34% of the grocery department units sold. These figures compare to 26% and 34%, respectively, for the second quarter last year. When you look at these trends compared to our first quarter results, corporate brand dollars and total units each increased by 100 basis points.  Our multibillion dollar corporate brand portfolio is a competitive advantage because it gives our customers more choices and variety and value to complement the broad assortment of national brand products we offer. This is particularly important today as many shoppers continue to watch expenses and look for quality items at affordable prices.  In addition to assisting customers on their quest for value, we also want our corporate brand products to appeal to a diverse customer base. We do this by providing the right products at the right price in our stores and also by communicating with our customers in the right way for them.  We launched our first bilingual website, comfortsforbaby.com, this quarter. The website provides parents a choice, a place to discover the high-quality products offered under the Comforts brand, and the Spanish language version of the site even includes content specifically tailored to Hispanic parents.  We are also expanding our selection of Big K brands soda flavors to appeal to diverse customer taste. We are launching several new flavors based on customer feedback including apple, pineapple, passion fruit, watermelon, kiwi, blackberry, citrus and mandarin.  As Dave said, rising food costs are affecting consumer behavior. While our estimated product cost inflation, excluding fuel, was approximately 5.2% for the quarter, we were able to slightly increase our $0.01 profit per item in the grocery category. Rising product costs continued to affect all departments. Inflation continues to be higher in our perishable department, including meat, produce and especially seafood.  Last quarter, we were beginning to read the shift in consumer sentiment, which translated into more obvious behavior changes this quarter. Customers are even more value conscious when they shop, are buying smaller baskets and are selecting some lower cost items, including our low -- our corporate brand products. This has made the value we offer our customers through lower every day prices, weekly promotions and personalized rewards to loyal households even more compelling. We will continue to pass along product cost increases from suppliers. At the same time, we will continue to invest for the future in pricing, people, products and customer shopping experience.  We continue to make good progress in our sustainability efforts. I am pleased to announce that 7 of our manufacturing facilities have achieved their goal of sending 0 waste to landfills. Zero waste means that every ounce of raw material that arrives in a plant is either used for product, turned into energy or recycled by our associates. we're all very proud of these plants.  Turning now to labor relations. We have a number of unsettled labor contracts currently past their original expiration dates, including negotiations in Southern California and Southeastern Ohio and with the Teamsters at our distribution center in Washington state. These negotiations are challenging because of our efforts to manage the increase of healthcare and other costs, a sluggish economy and our need to compete against non-union retailers with lower cost structures are contributing factors as well.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide good wages, high-quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefits for our associates. We are hopeful that both sides will continue their hard work to find mutually acceptable solutions. Contracts in Charleston, West Virginia area and the Memphis area are set to expire during the third quarter.  Now Mike will discuss our second quarter results and Kroger's financial strategy in detail. Mike?
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney. And good morning, everyone. As we reported earlier today, Kroger's second quarter net earnings totaled $280.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $261.6 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain tax adjustments. Without the benefit of these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.41 in the second quarter this year and $0.38 in the second quarter last year. This 7.9% increase is consistent with Kroger's expectations for the quarter, and long-term earnings growth expectations of 6% to 8%. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 53 basis points. This decline was mostly offset by improvements in our OG&A rate of 20 basis points, rent of 6 basis points and depreciation of 10 basis points. Our FIFO operating margin therefore declined 17 basis points. Our LIFO operating margin without fuel declined by 30 basis points due to the 13 basis point effect of our higher LIFO charge. The reduction of 20 basis points in OG&A demonstrates the leverage of our strong identical food store sales and cost control efforts in the face of rising credit card fees, pension and healthcare expenses.  Also, as a result of current expected operating performance for the year, our incentive plans are estimated to pay off at a higher rate than last year. Collectively, credit card fees, pension, healthcare and incentive plans have increased 30 basis points with incentive plans being the largest of these. Additionally, we increased our general liability reserves and incurred warehouse startup costs, which together, increased our OG&A rate by 10 basis points.  We continue to believe it is most beneficial to look at operating margin over an annualized timeframe. Excluding fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, the company's operating margin increased 10 basis points. For the full year, we expect the operating margin change to be less than this.  Kroger's retail fuel operations in the second quarter earned approximately $0.174 per gallon compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year. For the latter half of the year, we expect margins of approximately $0.115 per gallon.  I'll now update you on our long-term financial strategy. We're very focused on allocating the substantial cash flow of Kroger's business to reward our shareholders both today and in the future. During 2011, Kroger is using cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $428.5 million for the second quarter compared with $402.5 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investment for the year to be slightly above $1.9 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities.  Kroger saw a strong improvement in working capital during the quarter. We have implemented systematic improvements that will advance our progress in this area. In addition, higher fuel cost has helped us improve working capital by $152 million. We also saw a strong EBITDA return on net operating assets or ERONOA of 19.91%, which is an increase of 106 basis points from a year ago. This is the metric we use internally to measure our operating units. It represents rolling 4 quarters EBITDA divided by net operating assets, and we are very pleased with the increase in this important metric.  During the second quarter, we invested $258.6 million to repurchase 10.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $24.30 per share during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $403.4 million remain under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in March of 2011. Since the end of the quarter, Kroger has purchased 4.5 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.87 per share for a total of $103.5 million. We expect to use the full billion dollars during fiscal 2011.  Net total debt was $6.9 billion, a decrease of $49 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio adjusted for impairment charges in 2010 and 2009 was 1.71 compared with 1.87 during the same period last year. Based on the second quarter results, we are increasing our identical supermarket guidance for fiscal 2011. We now expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel of 4% to 5% per year. The previous guidance range was 3.5% to 4.5%.  Kroger maintained its full year earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share. Based on the current operating environment, the company expects to achieve results near the top end of this range. We continue to expect product cost inflation to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. Keep in mind the factors Dave mentioned that will continue to influence Kroger's sales and earnings performance throughout the year. The pace of the economic recovery, the impact of rising gasoline and food prices on consumer spending, the competitive environment, higher pension and healthcare costs and retail fuel margins.  Our long-term growth model is to generate 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon, including the dividend yield of 1.5% to 2% to total shareholder return rate into the 8% to 10% range. We aim to produce this with less volatility than the S&P 500 over that same timeframe. We are not opposed to a year occasionally exceeding this range, which is what we expect to deliver in 2011.  Now I'll return it back to Dave.
David Dillon: Thank you, Mike. Kroger had a solid quarter because our associates delivered strong results in line with our Customer 1st strategy and consistent with our expectations. The economy is sluggish, one of Kroger's strengths is our insight into our customers. As a result, we're able to adjust our offerings to meet the customers' changing needs. Whatever the environment, our Customer 1st strategy will maintain the right balance for our customers and shareholders, growing customer loyalty and delivering earnings and earnings per share growth consistently. We will continue to deliver value today and invest for the future.  Now we look forward to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: A couple of things. Can you shed a little more light on the accelerated investments? I know you're not going to say specifically, but generally speaking, where did those fall? And is that sort of an acceleration heavily weighted toward the quarter, or something that's going to be ongoing at that rate in the back half of the year?
David Dillon: John, these were investments that we often talk about in investments we make with the customers, things that we think will appeal to them. They are investments that we had planned to make at later times in the year that will be ongoing. We simply moved it up a little bit in time.
J. Schlotman: And the items that were selected based on the work that was done with dunnhumby as it always is in terms of identifying what's most important to the customer and the environment that we're in, and making sure those match against what the customer desires are.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: So that was all in FIFO gross, x fuel FIFO gross. And the -- so down 53 is not necessarily representative, some of that was pulled forward. Because I guess the other question is, are there any other issues with timing of pass-through? It doesn't sound like that's as much of a problem.
J. Schlotman: In the prepared comments, one of the things, it's one of the reasons we want to make sure, if you look in the grocery department, the profit per item actually improved slightly during the quarter. And we thought it was really important for everybody to understand that we were able to pass those cost increases through. And we actually, if you look at profit per item, it's slightly improve. It's not huge, but a little bit. Obviously in periods of inflation, the inflation itself will drive a little lower margin.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And then I guess as a follow-up to that, you talked about the sort of state of the consumer. Last time, you have talked about where the higher end consumer was thinking about eating out less, pulling in a little bit. Has that continued with that higher end customer getting more skittish?
David Dillon: Well, the customers obviously are segmented in this kind of the economy even more maybe than normal. And we're seeing that the higher end, more affluent customers, we're seeing their behavior actually continue pretty much what we've seen in the first quarter. So we're seeing good solid growth in areas that you might expect, same things we identified last time. Things like organic produce and sushi and Starbucks and Boar's Head meats and some of those areas are all performing solidly and continue to do so.
Rodney McMullen: And that customer is behaving as we would hope. But they continue to tell us they're more and more concerned about the economy, the stock market and eating out less. So what they're doing and what they're saying is a little inconsistent. But usually, eventually, it will catch up with what they say.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And then just one more final thing. How do you guys analytically get your arms around -- sentiment has nothing to do with the economy, it has to do with grid lock in Washington and stuff like that impacting the consumer and how long it lasts and how that alters their behavior. Is that possible to analytically get your arms around that or not really?
David Dillon: Well, first, don't get me started on that. This group's holding me back because I have some rather strong opinions on the subject. But the point you're really making is that we don't need to be economists to try to understand what's happening with the customers. We need to ask our customers, and we need to look at their actual behavior as it shows itself in the store. And by trying to do that, while there's not a way to quantify it with great precision, you can get a pretty good feel. And we've tried to give you some color to that, give you a sense of what we're seeing and I think we've done that. And I think, actually, I feel very comfortable that we have a good feel for what our customers go through. Part of it is driven really by our own associates who live every day in the communities that they serve. They themselves go through the same kinds of feeling, and then they of course live it through their own friends, neighbors, family and everyone else. And that gets reflected back in our thinking as well as the dunnhumby data, as well as the panel work that we do with our customers.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: So number one, can you remind us how you define a loyal household?
David Dillon: Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: It's a combination of number of visits and how much a customer spends. And some customers will come every day, other customers will come once every 2 weeks. Both can be loyal, and it really depends on their behavior and activity. And then we've done an awful lot of work of understanding where else they shop to understand how loyal they are to us versus other retailers.
David Dillon: Think of it as a grid that you have -- as opposed to metrics that go together to determine whether they're classified as loyal.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: And as you've obviously seen this change in shopping behavior, can you maybe provide some insights in terms of the more personalized reward program?
J. Schlotman: Well, if you look, it's something that we measure obviously every time we make a one-on-one marketing decision. Customers continue to react better and better in terms of as defined about their editorial feedback they give us and the actual usage of what we do on a targeted basis. Now we've been doing this for, I don't know, I guess 6 years now. And if you look at the trend over time, we've had tremendous improvement in terms of being able to engage with the customer in a way that they appreciate and need better and better. And it's something that every quarter we get better, but we're constantly working with dunnhumby and our merchandising teams to figure how to even get better from where we are.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then I just wanted to elaborate onto one of John's questions. But the 53 basis points in terms of the investment that we saw this quarter with regards to gross margin, we shouldn't think of that as being consistent over the next 2 quarters for this year, is that correct?
David Dillon: I would look at -- what we've tried to do is try to look at where we are in balancing investments in gross margin and money that we save in our overall expenses. And so it's that combination which produces the operating profit, is the way we think about it. And this quarter is a little unusual, frankly, and that's why we actually gave more color than usual. Because while the investment in gross was partly driven by when you have periods of high inflation, you're going to naturally have some of that, and then of course some of the things that we've done and chosen to invest. But the second thing is and we identified a lot more color on this was the various components of our OG&A and other expenses. We tried to show you that because there were several items that are unusual. And I won't call them onetime items, but I would call them things that aren't necessarily reoccurring. And examples of that is the incentive pay, is a good illustration, because it was a particularly low last year. And we're accruing based upon what we have given you as guidance for the year this year. So if we produced those results, then the expenses we've shown will be true. And if we don't produce those results, then we'll back some of those expenses out in later quarters. So if you take things like incentive pay, if you take some things like the additional accrual, general liability or the logistics expenses that we identified, you actually have much more savings in OG&A. The 20 basis points, in my mind, was the bigger issue and it was lower than it should have been. But if you take those other issues into account, it actually ended up being a higher number. So the difference between our gross investment and the expenses in the quarter was, in terms of our ongoing business, was much narrower than these numbers imply.
J. Schlotman: And the focus, as Dave has mentioned, the focus is really making sure we balance the OG&A reduction with the gross margin change. And if you look at the second quarter, as you look forward, we're working really hard to make sure that those stay completely in balance. There were a couple of unusual situations in the second quarter that made that difficult and that's what Mike highlighted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Can you guys tell us what you're selling gross margin was this quarter? I know that you omitted that from the press release this time around.
David Dillon: Yes, it was down 78 basis points. We had a really good solid expense control and some of the expenses that are embedded in the gross, in particular shrink really had a good performance. We didn't use it because we actually think it's -- we think it's more relevant for the way you all look at the business to look from the gross profit and the OG&A and the other expenses and then the operating profit. But you're certainly welcome to it.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And I'm just trying to understand what you're saying about the pulling forward of price investments. Because I look at your guidance, right, and your guidance hasn't changed, but the tax rate is obviously going to be lower because of what happened this quarter, which would imply that you're doing more than just pulling forward some price investments. I mean it would seem to me like that means that you're investing a bit more than what you would've thought last quarter. So what am I missing?
David Dillon: Well, if you look at what we would've had in our internal estimates or budgets, there may have only been 4 periods, or 5 months or 6 months of pricing investments. By moving them forward, we'll end up with 9 or 10 months of expense this year. And some of that will be additional expense in the dollars in 2011. Now the flip side, most of the things that we find, the lines would cross where the gross profit dollars actually improve over time. And those are the things that we would expect that would happen in 2012. So that would be one of the reasons for not the change in the adjustment. The other thing is, remember, a year ago we also had a tax credit over change in reserves that helped a couple of cents, too. And we had one in the third quarter as well.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And can I just ask about the decision to invest the tax savings into lower prices? And the reason I'm asking this question is because you look at this quarter and your IDs grew 5.3% yet EBITDA was up only 2.7. And last quarter it was 4.6 and EBITDA was up 11.6. And historically, you've had a lot of volatility, I should say, in these numbers, which is frustrating investors, I think, right, because you look at your stock today and what it's doing. And I guess the real question is, how do you balance the decision to pull forward investments and the near-term volatility that creates versus what it's going to get for the business as well as what you're looking to do for shareholders? And then also, how confident are you that you're going to get the return on this investment? The return in my mind would be that, going forward, the EBITDA growth would be better than ID growth maybe in the back half, and should we think about it that way?
David Dillon: Well, it may help you to know that our bonus plan, mine specifically but all of ours, is based upon, in part, based upon EBITDA. So you know that we pay close attention to that number. So that's the first thing I would tell you. Second is that we look at this over a longer time span. I don't think a quarter timeframe gives you a good enough feel generally. Sometimes it does, but generally doesn't give you enough feel for market. And one thing that we have tried to do, in fact I'd have to say -- I would want to say that we pride ourselves in doing, is try to give you an objective, as objective as an insider can give, an objective view of what we really think is happening inside our business. And that's the reason we tried to add some of this color about what was happening with the expenses because I actually feel the quarter was quite solid. I am very pleased with the way it balanced out. There were a couple of anomalies that were raised some concerns that you mostly addressed. For instance, we got the benefit of tax on one hand. We did choose to advance some spending on some items that was going to happen anyway, it's just a question of when we chose to put it in place. And we thought we'd get some benefits this year by going ahead, and we wanted to try to get those benefits in the second half so that's why we got started a little earlier. And then we had some expenses that were really the kind of that don't reoccur. The logistics expense, the general liability we've already mentioned. And then of course the incentive, if we had a decent year last year the comparison wouldn't have been as great. And then I haven't even mentioned the LIFO at all. But when you add up a sharp turn in inflation compared to where we were last year, if I can remember right, I think in the second quarter last year we had a deflation in grocery, I believe.
J. Schlotman: A little inflation. Very slight.
David Dillon: Slight inflation. And as a result, it was a totally different picture, so we had a big increase then in the LIFO charge this quarter, too, which as you know, just an accounting entry. So I feel better about it than what I think you're describing. And I would look at a longer-term horizon than just a single quarter and take the first quarter, second quarter and third and fourth and look at our guidance.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. So if in the back half we see some re-acceleration in EBITDA growth, that would suggest that the investment was worth it, and if we don't, then maybe not?
David Dillon: Well, I think the thing I would judge based on is what happens with our sales, what happens with our household growth and then what happens with earnings per share. If we hit the guidance that we've given you, and that's what we're saying we believe it will achieve, and we think that will be a quite solid year particularly. In any year, I think it'd be a quite solid year, but particularly given how sluggish the economy is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: I just wanted to check on my notes here. Did you say cost inflation ran 5.2 in the quarter, and it's going to decelerate to the 3 to 4 rate? Did I get that right?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, we said it was 5.2 in the quarter. We still expect for the year to be 3 to 4. And remember those numbers are year-on-year. And when you go back, we started seeing some inflation late last year.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So this goes to kind of the meat of my question. In the back half of the year, I guess, kind of inflation expectations cost. And also, if we could get some thought on just the cadence during the quarter and how the current sales run rates are. And it sounds like the consumer weakened up quite a bit maybe through your quarter, and maybe some current tonnage thoughts?
David Dillon: Well, I'll give you a few observations. First is the sales had some, I would say, modest growth through the quarter period to period to period. My personal opinion is that was driven more by the change of inflation and the change of retail pricing than it was driven by greater activity by the customer. So start with that. Second is if you look at the quarter so far and we're into this current quarter by what, 3 weeks?
J. Schlotman: And a few days.
David Dillon: Yes, 3 and a few days, and we are running in sales approximately the same as to what we did last quarter. So really, you'd have to say so far this is consistent with the trend we saw last quarter. As per tonnage, tonnage was positive. It was slightly positive. It wasn't strongly positive. And I think that's a clear result of higher pricing and people are buying fewer items as a result of higher pricing. And that's true not just with us, but I think that's a universal statement that would be true really with just about every retailer. In fact, my personal opinion is, is that the overall market in terms of if you can put your arms around items that are sold in the overall market, I think those items are down on the whole. And the fact that we are positive suggests, and I think it's absolutely true, is that we're growing market share and the market just seems to be contracting just a bit. So that's how I'd size that part up. We saw a slight shift more in the direction of Kroger brand products, not a big surprise. Sort of a reminder of maybe a year or so ago, maybe 2 years ago, as customers got more concerned about the economy, there was a little more shift towards our products. We're, of course, pleased with that because we think we have outstanding Kroger brand products. So I think that's a thumbnail sketch that I would leave you with.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And so you're still currently slightly positive on the tonnage, Dave?
David Dillon: Yes, it will be very similar to what we had in the third quarter.
J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't see it much different right now than what it was in the quarter.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And then one follow up. On the onetime expenses that you guys highlighted logistics and a couple of others, were those expected expenses even though they're onetime? Were they expected when you thought about the year or were they unexpected? And then I'll yield.
David Dillon: I'll talk about both of them. The logistics expense, we expected some expense. But we've actually run into some, just system operational issues that we've just got to work through that produced some higher costs. And sometimes logistics projects and other projects like that are really big infrastructure kinds of things and so the dollars can be quite large. But our confidence in terms of what it will ultimately produce is very strong. It's just that we ended up with some short-term costs that we hadn't planned on. General liability is an example. We review those, I think twice a year, actually, we look at them. But midyear every year, we look at where our reserves are and we just found that our reserves hadn't been high enough on some previous year expenses and so we've increased those. You want to add anything to that, Rod?
Rodney McMullen: I mean the general liability is primarily driven by our -- an increase in the cost per claim over what we had been trending and it caused us to raise our reserves for several prior years. So the short answer to your question is the 10 basis points we called out, neither one of those expenses would've been in our original expectations for the year, which is why we did call them out in the quarter. We don't want to make a bunch of excuses, but they are there.
David Dillon: Nor do I necessarily expect them next year.
Rodney McMullen: Right, exactly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I got a couple of questions. Maybe we can just start by talking about inflation in perishables. Everybody we talked to says that the highest inflation, and you said it, too, meat, produce, or the meat, dairy and seafood. And you talked about passing along higher inflation in dry grocery. But what's happening with perishables? I think you said in produce, it wasn't all being passed along? So I'm a little...
David Dillon: Well, I've generally made a big distinction on these calls in discussing inflation between center of the store and the perishable areas. And the reason really isn't so much competitive behavior, but it's because of customer behavior. In the grocery side of things, in the center of the store side of things, it actually is pretty clear-cut. We have been passing that along. I think all of our competitors have been passing that along. You see some tonnage change and the CPG companies, manufacturers and even retailers have to decide what's the right price for the tonnage. And so that's how grocery works out. But the perishables, customers shift what they buy in a nanosecond. I mean walk into produce, just as an example, and if bananas happen to be high this week, you start switching and say, I think I'll buy apples this week. So there are plenty of other things to shift to, so the rate of inflation and where the movement goes is really a totally interesting computer puzzle. And as a result, I would say that, generally, you wouldn't see a direct connection between what we're able to achieve in sales in a department and what happens with the rate of inflation in a department. And I think in produce, for instance, in that case it wasn't so much -- wasn't anything, really, other than the growing season changed. And as a result, product was short at certain points of the time, which meant the pricing was high at certain parts of the time, which meant customers didn't buy that product as much as they would have otherwise. So it ended up being a case where our gross profit in produce wasn't as strong as we thought it might have otherwise been, but for that spike in pricing.
Rodney McMullen: And the only thing I would add, if you expect something to go up in cost for 4 weeks or 6 weeks, many times you won't even -- you won't be able to pass that cost through because if it's going to come right back down in 6 weeks, it just doesn't make much sense to do that, especially if the market doesn't allow you to do that. So you really have to look at each category area specifically for that, and that would be one of the reasons in produce that you wouldn't see the same pass-through there as what you would see in grocery, because if Jiff raises the price of peanut butter, it's going to probably be that way for 6 months or a year or whatever.
David Dillon: Or even 5 years. It's very much more predictable in grocery. I think he's absolutely right.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. Now I want to go back to what I know is a dead horse, but I'm going to beat it anyway. I'm still confused about accelerating certain investments. I understand what you did, but I'm not sure I understand what it means for the rest of the year. You believe you'll get a benefit in the second half? And do you also mean that you're keeping the amount that you spend for the year fixed, so you moved it up in the second quarter but the full year will be the same?
J. Schlotman: If you look at the total dollars we would expect to spend in investments, we would expect them to increase because you'll end up with 9 or 10 months or 8 or 9 months of dollar investments, where before, we may have only had 4 or 5 months in the budget. So if you look at the dollars that we would expect to invest in pricing for the year, or services in some cases, you would end up with more dollars. In terms of the second half, the expectation, assuming that we picked the right things to accelerate the pricing on, is we would expect first the tonnage will improve nicely as a result of that. Then over time, the gross profit dollars will actually increase. But the gross profit dollars, in terms of them actually increasing, is different for different items, and that elasticity really is different for different categories. And that's the work with dunnhumby in terms of trying to make sure we understand that.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay, and just real quickly. In the past when you've had unusually high margin in fuel, you've seen that as the kind of windfall similar to the tax windfall. Did you look at it that way this quarter?
Rodney McMullen: I mean on the fuel margin, we wouldn't have looked at it any different. As you know, we're much more focused on fuel margin for the year because any particular month you'll have volatility both directions. The fuel margin happened, was better than we expected, a little faster than we expected. We would not expect that to continue going forward.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: You didn't invest that money?
Rodney McMullen: Not really, no.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Can you give us some idea on how gallons performed, fuel gallons performed?
David Dillon: I don't have that in front of me, but they were up.
J. Schlotman: The fuel gallons in total were up. On an identical basis, slightly up, but not as much as what they would have been in the past.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Does that suggest a reduced reaction to the rewards program? Any insight into that?
David Dillon: No, I think it's really more if you look overall everything that we can find, total gallon usage across the country continues to decline. And we continue to gain share. Also we would have some, we'd call it sister store impacts, but obviously impacts when you open a new fuel site on others. Some would also be as we expanded the Shell program, some customers that would've come for us before for a reward would go to Shell if the Shell location is more convenient.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right, I understand. Looking at your movement of some of these price promotion programs up in the year and higher overall spending, does that mean perhaps that something comes out of fiscal 2012 as a result of this?
David Dillon: We think that everything we do in any given year helps build for the next year, so the answer is yes. And we have -- we've given now, given you our long term kind of forecast of where we see the company. And that's one of the ways we produce continued growth in sales and continued growth in earnings by setting things up to cause the customer to keep coming next year.
Rodney McMullen: Chuck, I want to make sure we're answering the exact question you asked. It sounded to me like you asked the question, does this mean there was something we have planned in 2012 that we're not going to do now because we moved something into '11 so we have less investment in '12?
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: That's right.
David Dillon: Oh, okay. Well, that's not what I was answering, no.
Rodney McMullen: And I don't think that is what we would expect. We have a, as we've described regularly, we have 12 to 18 months visibility in how we want to invest dollars in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy. And as we move things around, if we have the ability like we did with the tax benefit to move something up to balance our earnings per share growth, we will look at what we want, how we want to balance overall spending in '12 as well.
J. Schlotman: But overall, we would be very focused on consistently delivering the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth plus the dividend of 1.5% to 2% for a total of 8% to 10%. And we would look at what we can do in '12 in the context of making sure that we can deliver that.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And looking at the tax rate as sort of funding, which you did in the most recent quarter, what were you reacting to? Was it a slowdown in the basket size, shrinkage in the basket size as you indicated? Was it something competitive out there that you needed to respond to?
David Dillon: Well, I think it's really 2 things. First is we look at tax like that as certainly not something that is replicable. It's not in our plan to have that every quarter. Love to have it every quarter, but not likely. And so it's a onetime thing, so we would not spend it in something that is new and ongoing. So I wouldn't incur some big new expense in the second quarter that's going to be a big new expense in the third quarter, if the way in which I thought of was going to pay for it was a onetime event. So all we really did was slide earlier some of the expenses that we were going to already be incurring. Second is, I think we read the economy as we've described it. It's sluggish and we thought any extra help that we could give to customers at this time would be appreciated. It was not in reaction to any competitive situation at all. In fact, I think the markets are quite rational right now.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And last question, Mike, you talked about the share repurchase. You plan to use the full $1 billion. Bump this over to you, Dave. Do you see it perhaps going above that this year with the increased board authorization perhaps occurring?
J. Schlotman: Chuck, at this point we have a little around $300 million remaining that we can spend. And we think that's comfortably going to keep us in the market for several months as we go forward here. And at this point, don't see any need to comment on whether or not we would increase the authorization with the $300 million remaining.
David Dillon: I do appreciate the question but that's a discussion actually for our board room, not for this call.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I guess just one quick follow-up on the pass-through discussion in perishables. Any outlook as you move into the back half of the year if that gets any better with the pass-through, or is that a concern to have for the next 2 quarters continuing?
J. Schlotman: Right now, we would expect probably, it wouldn't be so much the pass-through getting better but the inflation pressures would be a little less. Now if you look at dairy, we would expect a little less inflation there. If you look at produce, we would expect less inflation there. If you look at meat, we would not see much change in meat and seafood. So I don't think it's so much the pressure from pass-through as it's just the cost pressure, on the cost pressure side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: So Wal-Mart has made some comments that they'd like to widen the price gap with the grocers. Have you noticed them dragging their feet more on inflation, holding the line while others have raised, or any change in their behavior in the last quarter or so?
David Dillon: Well, Mark, I'm not going to comment on a competitor specifically. The comment we'll make is that we see the market as rational, and we see our competitors have followed a similar strategy to what we have. Generally, they pass through cost increases if they've gotten them.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And with your greater gross margin investment this quarter, did you notice others reacting to your move?
David Dillon: Again, I'd say the market was pretty rational and I would not characterize our gross profit investment as a promotional pricing that would generally cause the market to react. That wasn't our objective and I didn't see that happening.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then if you look at the overall inflation number of 5.2, what do you think the center of store inflation looks like right now?
David Dillon: Let see. Do you have that in front of you? We'll look that up, but...
Rodney McMullen: Total grocery that includes dairy would be slightly higher than that. With dairy, I think it's probably a little lower than that -- without dairy, I mean. It's probably right at or a little lower than the overall blended rate. It's about 5% without dairy. Now one of the things I want to -- and I'm not going too long into this, I'd be happy to talk about it later. But the inflation number we give out is a volume-weighted calculation based on how our product is sold and bought by our -- or how our customers buy our product. So we volume-weight the way in which a customer buys an item when we calculate the inflation number that we talk about. It's an entirely different inflation calculation than we use for LIFO, which is just purely the cost of product this year and how many items we have this year and last. And I don't know -- a lot of times people want to compare our inflation with other people's inflation, and all I know is how we calculate our inflation. We try to do it based on what our customers are seeing and feeling on how they shop, and I don't know how other people do their inflation calculation. So that's important to keep in mind.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Well, some of the other inflation numbers being called out are actual price inflation as opposed to the cost inflation you're calling out.
Rodney McMullen: Right.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. I think that's fairly clear. That's it for me.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital.
David Dillon: And I think we'll make this our last question, Karen.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So just housekeeping to clarify. Your guidance for the full year that was made to earnings guidance that was maintained, that reflects a $0.46 earnings quarter, not the $0.41, I assume?
David Dillon: That's correct.
J. Schlotman: Correct.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I guess, again, to the selling gross margin here. I mean I understand what you did and why you did it. And obviously, you're doing this for the benefit of the customer and the shareholder in the long term. But I guess the more cynical view would be you did have an opportunity to flow some of it to the shareholder and chose not to. And I guess along those lines, maybe help you understand why this may not be a situation that you ended up in, in '09. When you have invested in a category and your competitors reacted much more aggressively than you expected and that caused a 109 and 126 basis points deterioration in those 2 quarters. Can you kind of give a little color on that and why you feel comfortable that, that won't will happen again?
David Dillon: Sure. I think what we did not anticipate back then was the competitive environment that, really, had I been in a competitor shoes, I would've needed to become more aggressive. It wasn't so much back then that we did something that sparked a reaction. It was all of the operating environment was set up in such a way that you almost had to go after sales because we were all -- not we were all, we weren't, but many of our competitors were running negative identical sales and that generally produces a different kind of reaction. Well, in an inflationary environment like this, I'd be shocked if most of our competitors didn't have better sales than what they have had before, and we have better sales than what we had before. And it often is actually a little easier to manage. Now sometimes inflation gets a little too high. But it's a little easier to manage because you have inflation in your product cost, but you don't have it quite as much as you have in the expenses. So that's why I think that situation is different. I don't actually see them as parallel. And certainly not on our part any kind of a competitive move that we think is going to give us an upper hand or something. We think of the business longer term than quarter-to-quarter. We're looking at business over the course of a year and 2 years and 3 years, and we're trying to build. And so it shouldn't shock you ever that we reinvest in places that we think are meaningful to the customer. But at the same time, you should keep holding us accountable to find places to save to help fund that investment. And in this particular quarter, we did not do that and we've identified the reasons why. We think they are short duration. And as a result, felt like it was an acceptable and appropriate way for us to pursue a longer-term strategy.
J. Schlotman: I just would add one small point. If you look at earnings per share without the tax and other items, it's $0.41 versus $0.38, which is a 7.9% increase. If you look at the $1.95 on the top side of the range, that's an 11% increase in earnings per share for the year. And then obviously, add the dividend on top of that, which is close to 2% right now. So all 3 of those numbers are very, very strong looking out for the shareholder and delivering for the shareholder a return.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right. Okay, and then just a last question. What was traffic up in the quarter, same store?
David Dillon: Well, let's see. The traffic we have is total and it's not same store, right? And it was up about 1%. And the average sale was up about 4%.
J. Schlotman: Yes, but remember we had 39 fewer stores this year than a year ago. So our ID sales are actually higher than our non-ID sales because of that.
David Dillon: Thank you. And before we have everybody hang up, we do have a few comments we want to share particularly with our associates who we encourage to listen into the call. I want to remind you all that Sunday, this Sunday, is the 10th anniversary of the tragic attacks of September 11. We have asked that all of our supermarkets pause for a moment of silent reflection to remember the victims in honor of the heroes of 9/11. Kroger supermarkets in the Eastern time zone will pause for a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. this Sunday, marking the time when the American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Centers North Tower 10 years ago. Because of the time difference, stores operated by Kroger in other parts of the country will do the same thing later that morning.  We can do much more to honor the memory of those who perished and many of our associates will join in a special remembrances where they work. Our King Soopers Store Manager, Tim Dowdell, whose brother, Lt. Kevin Dowdell, was among the 343 firefighters who lost their lives in New York on 9/11. He displays the flag prominently at his store every day. And I love that.  I also encourage you to join in our local efforts throughout the month of September to recognize and thank our everyday heroes, whether it's a special celebration, a gift of a meal, a simple thank you. You can help show your deep appreciation to the men and women who help keep our families, communities and stores safe.  Thank you, all, for joining us today. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Kroger Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tanya, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to hand the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations.
Cindy Holmes: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David Dillon: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's First Quarter 2011 Results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We are very pleased with the exceptional overall results the Kroger team achieved in the first quarter. Our associates delivered on all facets of our Customer 1st strategy. We achieved strong sales, earnings and cash flow growth. Needless to say, Kroger continued to grow market share in the first quarter. In some, we successfully managed our strategy throughout the quarter, which drove solid performance in all of the areas that are important to our business.  Identical supermarket sales increased 4.6% without fuel during the quarter. This continues Kroger's industry-leading trend of positive identical sales growth for 30 consecutive quarters. I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work to produce such outstanding results.  Our first quarter performance was broad-based. Each of the 18 retail divisions had positive identical sales excluding fuel. We're particularly pleased with sales in our deli/bakery, grocery and natural foods departments. These overall results have given us confidence to increase the original guidance we issued in March, which Mike will outline for you in a few minutes.  Our guidance for the year reflects the balance we strived to achieve across our business, including strong identical sales growth and outstanding cost control, as well as increased earnings and earnings per share. Our Customer 1st strategy is clearly connecting with customers. We have shown that our focus on people, products, prices and shopping experience is meaningful to customers through both good and challenging times. Our strategy positioned us well to weather the recession, and will continue to differentiate Kroger from our competitors whatever the operating environment. I'd like to touch on 2 themes that will have the most impact on our business over the course of the year. The first is our commitment to Customer 1st strategy that we discussed. We want to reduce the overall cost of running our business, and doing it in a way that does not negatively impact our customers. We then reinvest those savings in our customers to drive higher sales, which in turn will increase earnings. The second theme is made up of several external factors that will influence Kroger's business this year. We discussed these 5 factors in March, and I'd like to briefly update you on where we are seeing each of these areas today.  First, as you know, the weak economy continues to present significant challenges for most households. The promising signs of the improvement we saw earlier this year seems to have stagnated. Unemployment remains high in most of our markets, and food stamp and other government program use continues at high levels. As predicted, rising prices for food and fuel are affecting customer spending behavior. Rodney will have more to say about food inflation shortly.  The overall retail environment is generally rational but strong competition for customer's limited dollars remains. Our price check show that most competitors are passing higher costs on to customers. We expect approximately $200 million of incremental expense from rising pension and healthcare costs for the year. Continued cost reduction in other areas is helping us offset these expenses, so we can invest in areas that matter most to our customers. And finally, during the quarter, our retail fuel operations generated the same earnings per share this year as last year. Because fuel is volatile, we should expect variability over the next few quarters. Even so, fuel remains a meaningful offering for our customers.  Of these factors, only one had a negative effect on our business this quarter, the rising price of fuel. This is because nearly $1 per gallon increase takes a big chunk of household budgets, perhaps as much as $100 a month, which forces families to make choices that change spending behavior. The other factors had a neutral to positive effect on our performance for the quarter. We expect these factors will have a dynamic effect on the overall operating environment this year. We will continue to follow our business strategy, and we'll make tactical adjustments as needed to weather these influences.  Rodney will now offer some insight into Kroger's strong business trends in the first quarter. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team did a great job during the quarter to set the stage for the rest of the year. Our associates' efforts to control expenses enabled us to maintain a compelling price position, relative to both discount and traditional grocery competitors, even as we continued to pass on cost increases. We are particularly pleased with our associates' dedication to connecting with our customers. This will truly differentiate Kroger from our competitors.  One measure of that connection is our total household growth which is up for the quarter. Our loyal household growth count grew at a faster rate than total household growth, indicating that our best customers are the primary beneficiary of the investments we are making in the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st strategy. We continue to reward our best customers for their increased loyalty. Customers visited our stores more frequently this quarter and purchased more total units compared to the same quarter last year. Price per unit was higher in the first quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting the effect of price increases from our vendors. The combination of more households, more visits per household, more total units purchased and higher retail prices drove sequential improvement in identical sales.  When we dive deeper into Kroger's results for the quarter, we see that identical sales were positive for both total household and loyal households. Identical sales growth among loyal households was stronger than the overall results. Kroger continued to see positive tonnage growth throughout the quarter, which comes on top of strong unit movement last year. Our promotional and pricing strategies are designed to deliver these sustainable results. The initiatives we implement focus on building long-term loyalty and expanding Kroger's competitive advantage.  Kroger's first quarter results reflect the power of offering our customers a choice of both corporate brands and national brands. Millions of loyal households shop with us, and 99.9% of them bought at least one corporate brand item per quarter. We're still working on that 0.1%. This is particularly important today as shoppers continue to watch their spending and look for quality items at good prices.  For the first quarter, corporate brands represent approximately 26% of grocery department sales dollars and 33% of grocery department units sold. These figures compare with 26% and 34%, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Growth in national brand categories where Kroger does not have a presence was the primary driver of this decline. Corporate brand share overall continues to be well in excess of the prerecession levels.  A highlight of the quarter was the launch of our new homes essentials brand, Kroger Home Sense, with 200 reformulated or rebranded products. The collection of smart simple solutions helps customers get great results everywhere in their home. You'll find our new brand in paper towels, facial tissue, paper housewares and more. We also introduced new artisan-inspired Private Selection, hearth-baked pizzas in the first quarter. And I can tell you at least the barbecue chicken one tastes delicious. My wife and I had it for dinner last night. These new offerings and others like them will help ensure our customers continued loyalty through our exclusive preferred brand. As Dave mentioned earlier, rising food costs are affecting consumer behavior. For the quarter, we estimated product cost inflation, excluding fuel, was approximately 3.5%. We saw inflation in all categories including grocery.  Grocery product cost inflation approached 2.1% excluding milk. Last quarter, we mentioned that rising costs for many agricultural commodities were driving higher retail prices for packaged goods in our grocery department. While that continues, inflation is disproportionately affecting our perishable departments especially seafood. We expect this trend to continue as well.  We are passing along product cost increases from suppliers and we plan to continue to do so. At the same time, we will continue to invest aggressively in our 4 keys, our pricing, people, products and customer shopping experience. Our customers continue to seek value in this economy. With inflation and rising gas prices, customers' budgets are stretched. The value we offer them through lower everyday prices, weekly features and personalized rewards to our loyal customers, continue to resonate with them.  We estimate we are currently saving our customers $2.1 billion per year. This demonstrates that while we are passing on inflation, we continue to provide significant value to our customers including price. We have done a lot of work over the last several years to integrate sustainable business practices in our everyday business operation.  Next week, we will publish our fifth Sustainability Report. As a preview, I'd like to highlight some of our most successful initiatives. Five of our manufacturing plants have achieved the impressive goal of sending 0 waste to landfills. That means that every ounce of raw material that arrives in our plant is either used for product, turned into energy or recycled by our associates. We're on the way to achieving 0 waste in our other manufacturing facilities as well.  Since 2009, our manufacturing division has reduced our monthly waste to landfills by more than 50%. Improved bagging techniques and increased use of reusable bags translated into saving an additional 159 million plastic bags in 2010. This puts more than -- puts us more than 35% of the way towards reaching our goal of saving 1 billion plastic bags by 2014.  I am proud to announce that our stores have now reduced their overall energy consumption by 30% since 2000. That's enough electricity to power every single family home in Fort Worth, Texas for one year. I'd like to thank our associates for helping reduce Kroger's energy consumption through their individual actions every day. These efforts by our associates are helping make the world a better place to live.  Turning now to labor relations. We completed successful contract negotiations for our associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana. And negotiations continue in Southern California and with the Teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the Midwest. We will soon begin contract discussions in West Virginia as well as the Memphis area. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages, high-quality affordable healthcare, job security and retirement benefits for our associates.  It is worth noting that our pension and healthcare costs attributable to labor contracts in Southern California are extraordinarily high, making those negotiations particularly challenging. The labor and benefit costs in this market has had an impact on results, and we are not enjoying the same level of success there as we have in the rest of the company. We are hopeful that both sides will continue their hard work to find mutually acceptable solutions.  Now Mike will offer more details on the first quarter and Kroger's financial strategy. Mike?
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned earlier, our identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 4.6% in the first quarter. Those sales drove strong first quarter net earnings we reported earlier today, totaling $432.3 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $373.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 4 basis points. While this was helped by favorable shrink results, it was partially offset by higher diesel fuel costs.  Kroger's first quarter OG&A rate, excluding fuel, was 36 basis points lower than the same period last year. The benefits of leverage from strong sales, productivity improvements and outstanding costs control more than offset rising credit card fees, healthcare and pension costs. Our objective is to invest in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy, identifying and delivering sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to make those investments consistently over time.  Our strong nonfuel sales allowed us to leverage rent and depreciation to provide a slight boost of about 7 basis points to the nonfuel operating margin. While we saw a strong increase in the first quarter operating margin, excluding fuel, we believe it is most beneficial to view operating margin over an annualized timeframe. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, our operating margin, excluding fuel, increased by 12 basis points.  With our expectations of earnings per share near the top of our guidance, we would expect fiscal year 2011 nonfuel operating margin to be slightly lower than this. It plays hand-in-hand with our strategy to continue to invest in gross margin as we're able to realize reductions on the OG&A line. We do expect to continue investments in our Customer 1st strategy during the year.  Turning now to Kroger's retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers and convenient stores produced solid identical gallon growth. These outlets earned approximately $0.124 per gallon compared to $0.117 in the same quarter last year. As Dave noted earlier, strong fuel margins did not enhance Kroger's first quarter earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily due to higher credit card fees which increased as retail fuel prices rise. We need the higher margins to cover this expense. We continue to expect margins of approximately $0.115 per gallon for fiscal 2011. I'll now update you on our long-term financial strategy. We're very focused on allocating the substantial cash flow of Kroger's business to reward shareholders both today and in the future. During 2011, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $573.1 million for the first quarter compared with $532.2 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investment for the year to be consistent with our original guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.  Kroger saw a nice improvement in working capital during the quarter. One item that helped was higher fuel costs. We sell fuel before we have to pay for it so it lowers our working capital. Additionally, we have implemented systemic improvements that will advance our progress in this area.  During the first quarter, we invested $544.3 million to repurchase 23.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $23.55 per share. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $602.7 million remained under the $1 billion stock repurchase program authorized in March. We expect to use the full $1 billion during fiscal 2011.  Net total debt was $7.1 billion, an increase of $47.3 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio, adjusted for impairment charges in 2010 and 2009, was 1.79 compared with 1.91 during the same period last year. Just as the first quarter results position us well to continue to invest in our Customer 1st strategy this year, they also position us for a better year than we originally thought. Therefore, we are increasing our identical supermarket sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2011.  We now expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. The previous guidance range was 3% to 4%. Kroger increased its earnings guidance for the year to $1.85 to $1.95 per diluted share. Based on the current operating environment, the company expects to achieve results near the top end of this range. The increase reflects the strength of our first quarter results and the higher estimated LIFO charge of $150 million for the full year. The original guidance was $1.80 to $1.92 per share. Additionally, we now expect product cost inflation to be in the 3% to 4% range. The previous range was 1% to 2%. Keep in mind the factors Dave mentioned, that will continue to influence Kroger's sales and earnings performance throughout the year. The pace of the economic recovery, the impact of rising gasoline and food prices on customer spending, the competitive environment, higher pension and healthcare costs and retail fuel margins. As Dave said, most of these were favorable in the first quarter and it's too early in the year to know if that will continue. Earnings per share growth rates in the second and third quarters will be near the low end of our full year earnings per share growth expectations. This is primarily the result of the $0.02 per share tax benefit recorded in each of these quarters last year. This is consistent with the annual guidance we've provided in March.  Our long-term growth model is to generate 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth rate over a 3- to 5-year time horizon. Including dividends, the total shareholder return rate is 8% to 10%. We aim to produce this with less volatility than the S&P 500 over the same timeframe. We're not opposed to a year occasionally exceeding this range, which is what we now expect to deliver in 2011.  Now I will turn it back over to Dave.
David Dillon: Mike, thank you. This was a very strong quarter for Kroger. As a result of our associates' hard work, we strengthened our connection with our customers who in turn are spending more with us. Our Customer 1st strategy is producing positive results and will drive increased sales and earnings growth well into the future. We now look forward to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Sure. First thing, I want to drill down a little bit on the consumer. So if you look at kind of the consumables part of your mix, with the vast majority, it looks like we're seeing modest -- very modest demand dampening and modest trading down. Is that fair? And then I also want to talk about discretionary part of the business too. But is it the consumer reaction modest to date in terms of how they are trading down or cutting the number of items they buy?
David Dillon: John, we are seeing some modest change. And modest would be the right word, it's really not very much. We're seeing some change in mix, some trading down perhaps, some choices being made, some of the areas that are discretionary areas. Several of those are still a bit challenged compared to our overall results. But our tonnage is still solid and that tells us that it's really modest changes that we're seeing.
J. Schlotman: The only other thing I'd add on top of that, John, is in a few places, you can see a little bit of where people are trading down to a lower expensive item or buying a little more on promotion. But I would echo what Dave said is it's very modest and very early. So whether it's a trend or just a little bump in the road, it's hard to say.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And then shifting gears, if you look at Fred Meyer and marketplace and some of the other discretionary items -- because it also looks like really across retail, there's some crowding out, people were out, right, buying food and gas and maybe buying a lot less discretionary product. Are you seeing that too in discretionary stuff you sell?
David Dillon: We would. Now I would never say -- I wouldn't say that it's ever been robust as we come through the recession but it's gradually improved. And I would say the improvement has slowed down. It's still improving but the improvement is definitely slower than what it was.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Okay, and then finally unless...
J. Schlotman: John, sorry to interrupt you. One other thing I'd add too is one of the things that makes it a little difficult in that area to know for sure is the weather in the first quarter was very challenging. And so it was either wet or too cold, so people weren't in the spring and planting mood, so that showed up on buying apparel and some of those things. It's picked up recently as the weather's improved. But how much of that is trend and how much of it is the weather, I don't know. That was one other thing I'd want to add on top of the comment I made before. Sorry to interrupt you.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Okay. And then finally, if you think about your gas business, maybe to talk a little bit about -- just if you look at your comp and the separation you've got from some others, and it looks like gas is certainly playing a role in that. So talk about the growth in gas, how that's impacting the in-store part of your business and then the support you're getting from vendors for gas-related programs because it looks like that's a competitive advantage.
David Dillon: Well, I'll comment on the overall view of gas. We've been pretty bullish on the idea. We've added lots of fuel stations over time. We continue to do so. And that's because we believe that the combination of having gas near our supermarkets is a very strong convenience. Customers also like the tie-in with our store sales, our store purchasing program. But I think that convenience is a real important aspect, so we're quite bullish. Our gallonage increases at a time when gallons in the U.S. are basically flat. So we think we're picking up a little market share there. But on the other hand, we have been adding for the last several years, and so I think that's part of the reason we've done that. I don't know that I'd have any comment about vendor tie-ins. Really, we have a lot of promotions but I wouldn't think that there's anything specific there that would be noteworthy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Crédit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: First question for you on your ID. Can you just kind of discuss the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, and how sales are trending so far in the second quarter?
David Dillon: Sure. It's a little hard to read sometimes when you have a holiday that changes dates, with Easter in the quarter. But trying to adjust for that, it looked like our sales gradually improved through the quarter and have continued to gradually improve into and through the first 3.5 weeks this quarter. So I mean gradual though, it's not a big difference. But it has gently risen and it's continued through the quarter and into the current quarter.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: And let me -- on the pricing and promotional environment, I think there's plenty of concerns out there amongst investors about how the second half of this year is going to look, particularly given what we heard out of Dollar General. And I think investors are generally concerned that Wal-Mart will eventually have to get promotional to drive sales. What are you assuming from the promotional environment in the back half of the year? What's your expectation in terms of -- I mean, you actually said that you're going to continue to pass through inflation, but the success that you're going to have there, and how realistic do you think your expectations are?
David Dillon: Ed, I think our expectations are pretty realistic. I don't try to guess what competitor behavior will be. I have some general assumptions about what it's been most recently. And I tend to think that, that's a projection of what it will look like in the near term. But there's always a few surprises out there. I think way too much is being made of Dollar General's statement, personally. They are not as big of factor in the food industry as you might guess. And even though they tend to be a deep discount kind of an operation, the kind of things that they sell don't particularly push us on competitive pricing that much. So I just think it's overplayed. In terms of Kroger behavior though, I think that we are very predictable. In fact, we try to make ourselves predictable for our customers primarily. And you see that we are not trying to become overly promotional. And in fact, we're trying to invest in those things that we think can be sustainable. And we use the term to mean things we can keep doing for a very long time. And so it is our intention to do more of the same that we've been doing. Find places to save, as we showed in the first quarter, reinvest those savings in ways that matter to the customer and then let our sales grow from there. We also have said in the comments I had that we think it's a reasonably rational market right now. A little bit of inflation I think has helped that. I suspect that we'll see some improvement and some sales at other operators as well because of that inflation. And that tends to bring some rationality to the blade. So that's how I'd sum it up. Rodney, you might have some comments?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, the only other thing I would add is one of the things we always want to make sure is that we have the flexibility to deal with over how the market changes. But what we have found is, when you look at our strategy overall, by focusing on people, products, shopping experience and price, the whole offering for the customer is a very broad offering that the customer enjoys. And we believe that, that will continue to gain share over time, and it's more than just price. Then our associates do an awful lot of work every day to make sure our customers have a total experience to the whole equation. So I think it's a broader discussion than price alone. And then I also think you want to make sure when you look at some of those competitors, look at equivalent type prices per unit, per ounce of volume and stuff. Some competitors may have a better price reputation than their prices really are.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: That makes sense. And if I could just squeeze one more in on fuel. It seems to me like you're managing this business slightly differently now. And what I mean by that is that if I looked at the slope of the curve in terms of wholesale prices this quarter, I would have thought that your gross profit for gallon would have been a lot lower than what it was. Has there been some change in terms of how you're managing the pricing in that business, which is allowing you to make a little bit more money than you traditionally would have in an environment where wholesale prices are rising the whole quarter?
David Dillon: I wouldn't read an awful lot into that either frankly, because fuel is actually -- of all the items we sell, is really pretty much determined by the market. The retail price is what the market is going to be. If you try to undercut the market, the market goes with you. If you try to go too high, the market stays where it is and you lose gallonage. So the market is just what it is. And sometimes, in times of rising price, you end up making a little bit margin. Sometimes it actually works the other way. The thing that seems to work the most is, in volatility, it seems to improve margins. But overall, we're going to see some quarters that don't produce much in margin and we're going to see quarters that produce good margin. We think that's why we like to look at it for a year. And frankly, you can even look at it over 2 years and get a cleaner picture because sometimes it's just going to be unpredictable. Rodney, do you want to add?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: So in terms of thinking about your new ID guidance and your change in your focus in terms of, well, where you think your core inflation is going from 1% to 2% to 3% to 4%, might your ID guidance be conservative?
David Dillon: Well, it's hard to say because we don't know fully what lies ahead. I think one of the things we were guarding against or guarding for, looking out for, was trend changes, people trading down or buying fewer discretionary items if things got a little tight. Because as we said, that while -- what we've seen is things have stagnated a little bit in the economy and behavior has sort of just plateaued there. And so the recovery that we had hoped to achieve may not be quite what we had hoped would be achieved. And so we're trying to leave room for that.
J. Schlotman: The only thing I would add is we just want to make sure that we're beginning to see some switching of people buying something that's a little cheaper in a category. And obviously, that's fine on units, but we want to make sure from an identical sales standpoint that, that's reflected. If we end up incorrect and this is just a little bump in the road, then I wouldn't disagree with your comment but time will tell on that.
Rodney McMullen: Deb, the other thing is that the 3.5% in the quarter and our guidance for the year. Keep in mind that if you look at produce and meat and seafood, they were huge drivers of that overall inflationary -- some of those and a couple of those were in double-digit inflation rates. And our grocery category, which is 1/2 of our sales, was still 2.1% without milk. And you have to kind of look at that inflationary compared to what items we're actually selling at those different inflation rates as well. My point is a lot of you all like to take our IDs minus the inflation and come to that answer. And with the disparate results of inflation in those kind of categories, it's even more difficult to do that this quarter.
David Dillon: That approach works a little better with grocery than it does with the other categories. And grocery was without milk was 2.1%, is that what it was?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, approaching.
David Dillon: At roughly.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: And then with regards to OG&A line, I think the last quarter, you talked about the ongoing implementation of operating efficiencies and in this quarter, you talked about outstanding cost control. Can you maybe dive a little bit deeper into some of what you're doing to really manage your expenses?
David Dillon: Rodney can give us some more particular but the main thing that I'd want you to remember is that we had, in this quarter in particular -- I mean, with a 36 basis point decline, we had just about everything going our way. We had good productivity improvement. We had really good focus by our associates. We had some lucky things that came out where in some healthcare cost that we might have expected didn't turn out quite as we had expected them in the quarter. Some things like that. But on the whole, we are very pleased with where that came out and it was strong. And I'm not sure it's predictive though of future quarters at least to that magnitude. Rodney, do you want to comment?
Rodney McMullen: Well the only thing I would add on top of that, it's very broad-based, and it really is our associates across our stores, our plants, our warehouses, our offices, focusing on every little $0.01 they can help save or make sure that we're executing well on the programs we have in place. So I really give the credit, broad-based, to them, and it really is in a lot of different places. And I'm very pleased with what everybody is doing.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Okay, and then just adding and finishing up, you talked about investments in Customer 1st, what types of investments might those be?
David Dillon: Well, the examples that we usually, is obviously is one of them, is pricing. But as Rodney was quick to point out earlier and he's right, is that it's actually far more broad than that. It's everything from training associates in areas that would be meaningfully important to our customers to working on customer service on the front end of our stores to improving out of stocks on the shelf. All of those require often systems or training or process change. And each of those we think is an investment that the customers appreciate.
Rodney McMullen: And the only other thing I would add, we're using more hours on our front end today than a year ago and 2 years ago and those kind of things. And all of those obviously improves the customers' checkout experience. Dave mentioned training. We're spending quite a bit more money on training to make sure our associates understand what we're trying to get done and why. We continue to focus on trying to improve the freshness of our products and making sure that the customer has the absolute freshest product they can. Obviously, there's costs involved in executing all of those pieces. And it's just trying to make sure that we get savings in places so that we can reinvest in those that really matters to the customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.
Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch: I want to follow up a little bit on Deborah's question. I mean, it sounds like you're running ahead of the comp range this quarter, to date. You mentioned Dollar General not a factor. Gas prices at the moment probably aren't going to be the worse of a drag in your consumer than they were in the first part. I think you guys called out natural and organic at the beginning of the call, and you're saying sales continue to gradually improve. Can you just contrast all that with maybe the comment that the early improvement seems to be stagnating? I'm confused. Are things accelerating or are they stagnating? And maybe help me get maybe a better picture of what you guys feel is generally going on at the moment?
David Dillon: I think that the stagnation that we're describing is the overall environment that the customer is operating in. And we can see it in small ways in the behavior, that some of the trading down and exchanges that we described. Our relative performance within that overall market though has been strong. And as a result, it may not show quite as much in our performance, as it will overall, is that you won't see the industry recover quickly, rapidly just because of what's happening with food purchasing in my opinion. So I'm very pleased with where we are. The thing I would remind you though, we went through 5 factors that are basically external factors. But we identified March that we talked about today, those 5. The only one that really went against us in the quarter and the quarter ended middle of March -- I mean, middle of May, roughly. The only thing that really went against us was the high price of fuel which caused customers to have less money in their pockets, which we think drove a little bit of behavior change. The other areas tended to work in our favor. If some of those other areas were to turn south, we think that, that could have a little bit of a dampening effect on our positioning going forward into the rest of the year. So things like if food inflation got more wild than where it is, causing a shift in behavior, that's when it actually becomes a little more problematic for us, I think. Something like that could do that. You could have a change in competitive environment which we were already asked about before. I don't foresee that right at the moment but you just never know. Those are some of the examples and I think it changed the picture.
Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch: And just near term, as you guys head into the July 4 weekend, Wal-Mart's made it clear they're not repeating any of those rollbacks last year. Can you just sort of give us your sort of anticipation about what the environment is going to look like heading into that period and how you guys feel about that versus last year?
David Dillon: We plan to have a solid 4th of July selling time, and we plan to do it in a way that's consistent with the way we've been doing it for the last several years, not just that holiday but every holiday, just try to meaningfully give customers what we think they want, in a way that we can keep doing it. So we've tried not to be overly promotional. And that's the kind of thing that you can't sustain because then the next year, you got to be more than that in order to make it work. So I think that's our forecast for July 4. We're pretty excited about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So I think Rodney touched on Southern California, I think, in his prepared remarks. Our sources are saying things are getting pretty testy down there. Any thoughts on the likelihood of repeating '03 at this stage, or you think that's just kind of off the table that there's not a chance?
David Dillon: We had some comments in how we saw Southern California and the challenges relative to healthcare and pension and that sort of thing and the comments that Rodney made and so I won't repeat those. But I will say to that, and this is about all I want to say about negotiations, is that both sides in the negotiations are showing the patience needed to solve the problems at the bargaining table. So we're really very hopeful that the process will eventually result in an agreement.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then, I know we touched on it before, but our recent surveys are showing that some of the people that are a little sharper on price have started to drag their feet in some cases. And actually, you guys had actually put that bucket in some markets. Do you think that's, that's accurate, that some people have started to drag their feet a little bit and are trying to push their own competitive advantage to gain share? I know you've made some comments to Robbie's question that you think that you guys are benefiting maybe in the environment. Is this market with high gas prices and the advantage of your business really kind of Kroger's time to shine?
David Dillon: One of the advantages we have in times with high gas prices, and it's not just true for us but it's true for us too is that you hear a lot written about consumers making fewer shopping trips. And yet, the data we've seen now and what we saw before is we see more trips. And when we see more trips, and we're looking at households now as opposed to customer count, although customer count went up too, but we're really looking at households. And the households show more visits and the best we can figure based on talking to customers, what we think is happening is people are making fewer trips overall. But as they make those trips overall, they are shopping at Kroger more often. So Kroger is convenient to every one of those trips they make. And since we're convenient to every trip they make, they shop in us more often. That's an advantage that actually shows up about now.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And finally, I just one, one last one. It's more long term. So besides same-store sales which are obviously fantastic, you guys are gaining shares, been happening for years, how do you grow this business?
David Dillon: I hate it when you give us a setup to talk about our strategy. But you did, so I will. Our strategy actually is pretty simple. It's been the same now for a long time. It's really trying -- genuinely trying to recognize that our earnings growth comes from better sales at Kroger. And our better sales come from connecting with customers better than we previously did. And so, we're focusing all of our efforts on trying to do that. We know we need to find a way to afford to do that. And so the way we have chosen to try to afford to do that is reducing costs and reinvesting those in the things that we discussed a little earlier. I think that's the story going forward. I think that's what you'll see the rest of this year from us. I think that's what you'll see for several years and to the future from us.
J. Schlotman: Scott, the only thing I'd mention is when we talked about market share in March, keep in mind there's been 40% share available held by none of what we call, large players in those markets. And driving some of that year, every year is clearly part of our strategy. And with that amount of share available in the markets we operate, we think we have the ability to continue to grow in our markets.
David Dillon: And I think that's -- I'm glad you added that, Mike. That's a really important concept as there is a lot of business out there and we don't think of it as s sum-0 gain. We look at our customers who are in our stores already and the amount of business that they don't give us for a variety of reasons. Sometimes we're not convenient. Sometimes we don't carry the item they want, lots of other reasons. But for whatever reason, there's a large amount of their business that they don't give us that they could give us. And we're focused on trying to improve on that. And we think we could grow our IDs at meaningful numbers for a long time and not run out of runway on that theme.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: This is actually Stephen on for Adrianne. Just had quick follow-up on kind of the consumer spending patterns that you're seeing and any kind of color that you could give us on the bifurcation between your lower-end consumer, the value points versus the higher-end consumers within the dunnhumby data that you look at?
Rodney McMullen: If you go back and look for most of the first quarter, clearly, the behavior of higher income customers, they were spending more and changing the behavior more than the lower income, was continuing, really focused on their budget. If you look at recent data, and that's the just the last few weeks, we're starting to see some behavior changes even in the higher-income customers. And a lot of that is driven by our stuff is showing people are eating out less. Now, obviously, when people eat out less, that's a benefit for us because they're going to get their meals from us versus going out to a restaurant. And we're starting to see that behavior change and we're starting to see that behavior change in all categories, not just the lower-income customer. One other thing on lower-income customers, if you look at like food stamps and WIC and those types of things, they continue to grow but not quite at the same level it was growing, which would be something that's on the other side, where it would suggest things are getting a little better. But during the quarter, we actually are beginning to see some changes later in the quarter which has caused us to make some of the comments we have. But even with that said, we think we're very, very well positioned to address if it ends up becoming a little softer because of our convenience store and our bigger value we offer for the customer.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And just as a quick follow-up to that question. So as gas prices have come down at the end of the second quarter, would you expect that to reverse? Or I guess you're not seeing that yet. I guess just any kind of thoughts on how that could change as gas prices come down?
Rodney McMullen: As you know, we've been in the Gas business for years. And we found one of the smartest things to do on gas is never predict it. And what we've -- when we look at the business overall, what we're really focused on is trying to add convenience for our customers to make it just a little easy for their shopping trip. We, seriously, we do not try to predict where gas prices are going to go because I get a kick out of, what was it, 3 weeks ago, I cut out a headline where gas prices are going to $5 a gallon. And then I think, it was yesterday or day before, the headline was that gas has hit its high point and it's going down from here and this is by very reputable newspapers that are making those comments. So we really don't try to predict. The only thing we do know is it will be volatile. And at the end of the day, volatility actually helps us but it's no fun along the way.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just to clarify on that last question in terms of you saying that the higher income customer looks like they're changing their behavior or they just started to change their behavior a little bit? I guess I'm not clear. Is that to your benefit or not? Because it sounds like you're implying they were maybe trading back into you from eating out?
J. Schlotman: That's just beginning, and it's one of those things -- when you get so much information, at some point, you don't know whether it's just a blip for a few weeks or if it's a trend change and that's the reason why we're a little cautious on it. At the end of the day, we think it will benefit us. But if it actually happens, we do think at some point behavior will change. And if you think about if inflation got stronger at some point, people are going to stop having as much money to spend on food, some of those kind of things. But it's early on. So we didn't want to try to suggest that it's a complete trend change, but there's just a couple of things that would cause us to pause that we thought would be important to point out.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, and sorry the middle- to lower-income customer, you would say, has taken a step down?
David Dillon: No, they really haven't changed behavior but they never changed behavior as the economy got better either.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Got it. And then just to clarify, when you are talking about competitors passing on inflation, does that in include Wal-Mart?
J. Schlotman: Yes, we would not separate any specific competitor. When we look at it, we look at competitors of the basket overall and individually, so we would not separate any competitor out from the rest.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then I guess obviously, there was a lot of noise with price increases that kind of took place more specifically in this quarter. Did that have any impact on your strategy from an investing and price perspective? Because I mean, obviously, the selling gross margin, we look at it on a 2-year basis, but I'm just wondering if you maybe held off a little bit this quarter just because there was too much noise with pricing?
David Dillon: There would certainly be categories where we modified our approach based on what was happening from an inflation standpoint. And in some cases, that might be changing what we did earlier, some cases, it might be waiting later to what we had planned to do, but there's no doubt we changed our strategy. And as you know, that's one of the things we try to make sure we keep the flexibility and modify as we go along from a tactical standpoint.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, and then I guess turning to more financial-related questions. On your share repurchase, obviously, you did quite a bit of share repurchases this quarter and you still have some left on your existing facility. But what are your thoughts on increasing that amount during the year?
J. Schlotman: We have $600 million left, so I think we have a bit of a runway before we would need to worry about addressing that question with our Board. And as we said, we do expect to use the $1 billion this fiscal year.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay; and then on the tax rate, I was just wondering what -- you raised it a little bit. Is it probably to 36% or something?
J. Schlotman: That's just that our current estimate of where we think the year is going to be, as you look at all the ins and outs on the tax rate, it wasn't dramatic. It's just a refinement of what we believe the effective rate's going to be.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to ask about how the inflation built into your comps for the guidance because previously, you were thinking 1% to 2% inflation with a 3% to 4% comp. And now, you think inflation will be 3% to 4% but the comp guidance is only 3.5% to 4.5%. Are you building in some cushion in case volume slows?
Rodney McMullen: The way we do we would estimate inflation -- the estimated inflation number is really a point in time estimate. So it's not the average for the year that we expect a higher rate. It's really the point in time estimate. And it's more driven on terms of how we use it for our LIFO reserve. If you look at the average for the year, it would not be as high. What we find is that inflation within our business always lags in terms of, as it flows through. But it happens, it just lags a little slow. I don't know, Mike or Dave.
J. Schlotman: No, I agree with you. The other thing we keep in mind, Mark, is we are cognizant of -- as we went through the recession and there was mixed change because of the recession and some inflation that our tonnage stayed very strong but the price points people traded to were a little bit lower which could affect reported IDs. But the underlying health of the business, we would expect to stay there and that weighed on our mind, as well. And I want to go back again and remind you that the first quarter for grocery was just over 2% without milk. So 1/2 of our sales still are not very far outside that original 1% to 2% expectation range.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and is the 3% to 4%, is that what you expect to be by the end of the year is what you're saying?
J. Schlotman: Correct.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then just to switch topics a little bit. We've seen a lot of news in the headlines about change in the debit card fees. Could you talk about what that could mean for you? And would you pass it through to the consumer, or would you let it flow to the bottom line.
David Dillon: Well, debit card fees, we've talked a lot about credit card and debit card fees in the past. You know that the overall fees have been challenging to the industry and us in particular. We view it as an expense of the business, part of our OG&A. And as we find ways, even if it's the legislature that helps us, as we find ways to reduce our costs, it is our intention to take those costs saved and invest them in things that matter to the customer. So the answer is yes, we plan to pass that through in one form or another in ways that matter to the customer.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: And any way of quantifying how big that could be? Is it going to be a big reinvestment for the customer?
David Dillon: We don't have an estimate that we want to make public at this time.
J. Schlotman: Yes, and the other thing to remember on the credit card side, we have increased usage of credit card which to that extent continues to grow. So it's just not -- you got to look at the total together. You can't just look at one piece by itself.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: How much of your tender is debit card swipe right now?
J. Schlotman: It would be a meaningful percentage but it's highly variable across the country. So -- and it's the type of highly variable across this country. So what do they say, all short statements and economics are wrong. And it's one of those things where really is very high variance across the country.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: I want to look at a couple of the smaller parts of the business, but I think it might be telling how do the C-stores do? And how did the jewelry stores do? And maybe you could talk about the customer behavior in the jewelry stores. And also, have you -- could you report a supermarket gallon growth -- gasoline gallon growth number on this call?
David Dillon: On the C-stores, a good quarter. About 1/2 or -- between 1/3 and 1/2 of our C-store divisions overlap with our supermarket. So they really are tying together where we go to market together as one entity rather than 2 separate companies, which I think is helping provide customers a bit better value. So overall, a good quarter. The numbers wouldn't be that much different than the supermarket side from a gallon growth or that type of stuff. On jewelry, I would say the thing on jewelry is it's volatile from week to week. Overall, it was a solid quarter, I wouldn't have said a great quarter but a solid quarter but volatile across the quarter.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: So what does that tell us about customer behavior, Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: It's a good question, Chuck. I think what it's telling you is that customers are still awfully nervous. But when they get a little money in their pocket, they want to do something. Or if there's an event, they want to do something. And it's trying to make sure that you're ready when the customer wants to do the something. I still think they're cautious but they've done without for so long, they do try to splurge when they can.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right. Any numbers you can give us on same-store gas gallons at the supermarket?
David Dillon: You asked about the gallons, and the gallons in supermarkets and C-stores, the ID stores were both positive, in low single digits, I guess.
J. Schlotman: C-stores were low single digits. Supermarkets would be mid-single digits but pretty close to one another, depends where you want to draw the line on low and mid.
David Dillon: And the importance of that I think is that based on everything we read anyway is that the gallon usage across the U.S. is essentially flat. And that suggests we're growing share in our ID stores, so that we're very pleased with that.
David Dillon: Well, before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional thoughts with all of our associates who we encourage to listen on. First, I want to thank you for your contributions to a solid start to a new -- to the new fiscal year. You continue to delight and connect with our customers, and you achieved outstanding cost control in the first quarter. Your actions everyday make a real difference.  I also want to recognize associates in several retail divisions for their heroic efforts during the recent severe storms. For example, in Paducah, Kentucky, a team of nearly 100 associates and customers built a levy around our Kroger store #414 to keep water from rising and flooding the store.  When tornadoes hit Huntsville, Alabama, our store and logistics associates along with manufacturing and facility engineering and many others kept our stores opened and stocked even without power and without hot water, for customers who need food and supplies in the town that was in serious trouble.  And our team at Dillon stores 105 in Joplin, Missouri also deserve special recognition, led by our co-manager, John Gallahue [ph], 35 associates and customers took shelter in the produce cooler when the tornado swept through the community. Remarkably that produce cooler was about the only part of the store left standing after the storm passed. John and his team had just a few minutes to react, and because they had implemented the emergency procedures they were trained for, every person in the store survived.  Many other locations had impacts, too long to list here, but it included places like Cleveland, Tennessee and others who should be recognized. So we want to express our deepest appreciation to all our associates who helped respond to these storms and to serve our customers through this difficult time. And frankly, we're looking out for each other. You are truly great people. Kroger is an amazing family. That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for attending today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2010 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michael, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one topic with one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you for your cooperation.  This is my last earnings call as Kroger's Director of Investor Relations. And I would like to thank the investment professionals that I've met during the past seven years in my role. I appreciate the opportunity and have learned much from you.  I will now turn the call over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David Dillon: Thank you, Carin. Thank you both for the introduction and also for your years of service as our Director of Investor Relations. We're very proud of you.  No doubt you'll miss reciting the Safe Harbor language, which you should know by heart by now. I want to welcome Cindy Holmes, our new Director of Investor Relations at Kroger. She brings a wealth of experience to the position, and I look forward to working with her in her new role.  And now I'd like to thank those of you listening via teleconference and webcast and thank you for joining us today. With us to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full 2010 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We are very pleased with our strong financial results in the fourth quarter. We believe these results are the outcome of our consistent approach to managing Kroger's business and following our Customer 1st strategy, which continues to connect with a broad range of shoppers. Our fourth quarter results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business, including positive identical sales growth, increased tonnage and loyal household count, good cost control as well as growth in earnings and earnings per share. We are encouraged by several improving customer and economic trends, which we hope signal the beginning of a return to a more normal operating environment.  Kroger's identical supermarket sales for the fourth quarter increased 3.8% excluding fuel. This is Kroger's 29th consecutive quarter of positive identical sales growth, excluding fuel. These results are due in large part to our fantastic Kroger associates, who work hard every day to deliver on our Customer 1st strategy and delight our customers.  As Kroger continues to outpace many of our competitors on identical sales growth, it's no surprise that we increased our market share in fiscal 2010. In a few minutes, Rodney will share some data on Kroger's market share increase.  Our fourth quarter identical sales was broad-based across the country and across supermarket departments. Each of our 18 retail divisions produced positive identical sales growth, excluding fuel. Every supermarket department also experienced positive identical sales growth in the quarter with the strongest increases in natural food, deli bakery, produce and meat. We were particularly pleased to see solid growth in our drug and general merchandise department where sales had softened during the recession as customers scaled back discretionary purchases. The fourth quarter is an especially important time of the year for this part of our business.  We focus on internal sales growth or identical sales growth, excluding fuel, because it powers our business model and generates earnings in free cash flow that rewards our shareholders. Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% over a rolling three- to five-year time horizon. Including Kroger's dividend, the company's business model is expected to generate total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. Our goal is to produce an average annual return for shareholders that matches or exceeds the S&P 500 Index over the time horizon that I described but with less volatility. Later, Mike will discuss Kroger's annual guidance for fiscal 2011.  In the meantime, I'd like to address a few important factors that will influence Kroger's business this year. First, the economic recovery continues to be slower and weaker than expected and we believe this will persist. We see some promising signs of improvement but the recovery remains fragile.  Unemployment is high in most of our markets and food stamp use continues at its peak. Rising food prices and fuel prices will affect customer shopping behavior. Rodney will talk more about food inflation shortly.  We anticipate the overall competitive environment in 2011 will be more rational but still challenging as retailers compete for customers' limited dollars. We believe our balanced business strategy will further widen the gap between Kroger and other retailers.  We expect to face approximately $200 million of incremental expense from rising pension and healthcare costs, continued cost reduction in other areas will help offset these expenses so we can invest in areas that matter most to our customers. And finally, margins in our retail fuel operations can be unpredictable and will affect our financial results.  For fiscal 2010, fuel margins enhanced Kroger's profits. Overall, we will continue to follow our business strategy and make adjustments as needed to weather these key factors. Rodney will now offer some insight into Kroger's strong business trends in the fourth quarter and some 2010 market share statistics. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on building our loyal customer base is working. I'd like to review some key measures of our progress in the fourth quarter.  Our number of loyal households increased once again, as did our total household count. Total units per basket were flat to slightly lower than the same period last year and customer visits were higher. As a result, we sold more units to both total households and loyal households compared to the fourth quarter last year. We believe these statistics reflect our customers' continued cautious spending.  Price per unit sold was higher in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, reflecting the effect of higher prices from our vendors. The combination of more households, more visits per household and higher retail prices drove sequential improvement in identical sales compared to our trends earlier in 2010. When we dive deeper into Kroger's results for the quarter, we see that identical sales were positive for both total household and loyal households.  Identical sales growth among loyal households was stronger than the overall result. Kroger continued to see positive tonnage growth throughout the fiscal year on top of strong tonnage growth in fiscal 2009. Our promotional and pricing strategies are designed to deliver these sustainable results. The initiatives we implement focus on building long-term loyalty and expanding Kroger's competitive advantage.  In the grocery department, the fourth quarter tonnage increase was primarily driven by positive growth in national brands. Our stores also sold slightly more corporate brand units compared to the same period last year. For the quarter, corporate brands represent just under 35% of product units sold in our grocery department. This was a slight decline in share compared to the fourth quarter last year. Kroger's fourth quarter tonnage results highlight the balance we seek in increasing both sales of corporate brands and national brands at the same time.  Our multibillion dollar corporate brands portfolio is a competitive advantage because it gives our customers more choices and variety and value to complement national brand products. Kroger customers in all segments buy a wide assortment of corporate brand grocery and household items. This is particularly important as many shoppers continue to watch expenses and look for quality items at good prices.  Rising food costs are on the minds of our customers and investors today. Rising costs for many agricultural commodities are driving higher retail prices for packaged goods in the center aisles of our stores. Some of the inflation affecting our perishable departments, certain produce items, for example, is more seasonal and will cycle as additional sources of supply open up throughout the year.  For the fourth quarter, we estimate that Kroger experienced product cost inflation of roughly 2.3%, excluding the effect of retail fuel. This inflation was primarily driven by higher year-over-year costs in our Meat department.  We did see inflation across other store departments including Grocery for which product cost inflation approached 1%. This follows six consecutive quarters of deflation in the Grocery department. We are passing along product cost increases from national brand suppliers in grocery today and we plan to continue to do so.  As always, our popular corporate brand products will continue to offer customers thousands of quality, affordable choices that fit any budget. As Dave mentioned earlier, Kroger increased its market share in 2010, which is one of the important measures of our success.  According to the Nielsen Homescan Data, Kroger's overall share of grocery product sales in the markets where we operate grew approximately 80 basis points during fiscal 2010. This data also indicates that our share increased in 13 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report, declined slightly in four areas and remained unchanged in two.  Wal-Mart supercenters are our primary competitor in 17 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report. Kroger's overall share of grocery product sales in those 17 markets grew approximately 75 basis points during fiscal 2010. This Nielsen Homescan Data is generated by customers who self-report their grocery purchases to Nielsen regardless of the retail channel or grocery outlet. It illustrates not only is Kroger growing bigger among traditional grocers but we are also gaining ground in the larger retail market for grocery and consumable items, which includes many nontraditional competitors. This is very important because the competitive dynamics of our industry continue to evolve.  Supercenters remain a formidable competitor but several other retail formats have entered the arena also. If there is any consistent in our industry, it is change. Change in retail formats and change in customer behavior. Retailers that become more relevant with customers will survive and thrive in the long run.  Because of several key competitive advantages, Kroger is well positioned to be a successful long-term player in this operating environment. One advantage is our unwavering commitment to our Customer 1st strategy. Another is our strong market share position and our ability to leverage the scale of an $82 billion business.  Another advantage is Kroger's partnership with dunnhumby, which continues to help us increase customer loyalty through our family of stores. Of course, Kroger's associates play a big part in building long-term customer loyalty and we remain committed to investing in them.  These investments include providing good quality affordable benefits in ways that allow us to operate competitively with the non-union retailers in each of the market we serve. Because Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs, cooperation between Kroger and the local unions that represent many of our associates is essential. We have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and opportunities for our associates.  With that objective in mind, we were pleased to ratify labor contracts in Seattle and Little Rock, Arkansas during the fourth quarter. In 2011, we'll be negotiating agreements with the UFCW unions in Southern California, Memphis and West Virginia, and with the Teamsters, who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the Midwest.  Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's 2010 fiscal financial results and our 2011 guidance. Mike?
J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to personally thank Carin for her seven years in Investor Relations. She has been a key player in shaping our strategies. I also look forward to working with Cindy in her new role. Both of them have made big contributions in their respective areas and will continue to do so in the future.  Earlier today, Kroger reported fourth quarter net earnings totaling $278.8 million or $0.44 per diluted share. These results include a noncash charge resulting from a goodwill write-down for a small group of stores. Excluding this goodwill impairment charge, net earnings for the quarter would have been $290.8 million or $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $255.4 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the same period last year.  Kroger's fourth quarter FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, was comparable to the same quarter last year as a rate of sales. This was mostly due to improvements in shrink and advertising expense as a rate of nonfuel sales.  Kroger supermarket selling gross margin rate increased one basis point excluding fuel. Kroger's fourth quarter OG&A rate, excluding fuel, was 39 basis points lower than the same period last year. This is an exceptional result given the ongoing pressure we face from rising credit card fees, healthcare and pension costs.  We were able to overcome these pressures through the combination of positive identical sales growth, good cost control and our ongoing implementation of operating efficiencies. Identifying and executing sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest in all four elements of our Customer 1st strategy, our great people, lower prices for our customers, our product offering and our customers' shopping experience.  Kroger's fourth quarter operating margin, excluding fuel and the goodwill impairment charge, rose 31 basis points as a rate of sales compared to last year. This was driven by the OG&A leverage I described and a couple basis points of leverage over rent expense. A higher LIFO charge in the quarter pressured Kroger's nonfuel operating margin by about 10 basis points.  While we encourage investors to look at Kroger's operating margin over a longer time period, usually on an annual time frame, it is important to highlight our fourth quarter results in this area. These results demonstrate sequential improvement as we transition back to a more normalized operating environment for our industry. Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2010 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations.  We were very pleased to celebrate the opening of Kroger's 1,000th supermarket fuel center. In the fourth quarter, Kroger's retail fuel operations continued to generate solid identical gallon growth at both our supermarket fuel centers and convenience stores. These outlets earned approximately $0.102 per gallon compared to $0.094 in the final quarter of fiscal 2009. This part of our business had no impact on Kroger's year-over-year net earnings per share increase for the fourth quarter.  For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.122 in 2010 compared with $0.106 in 2009. Higher fuel margins plus strong gallon growth provided roughly $0.06 of the year-over-year increase in Kroger's consolidated earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2010.  Let's turn now to Kroger's full year results for 2010. Net earnings were $1.12 billion or $1.74 per diluted share. The goodwill impairment charge incurred during the fourth quarter reduced our 2010 results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. The tax benefits recognized in the second and third quarters of the year increased Kroger's net earnings by approximately $0.03 per diluted share.  Full year net earnings in the prior year were $1.71 per diluted share, excluding the asset impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of that year. Kroger's full year 2010 operating margin, excluding our retail fuel operations and adjusting for the impairment charges in fiscal 2010 and 2009, was 22 basis points lower than compared to the prior year. This performance does not reflect Kroger's long-term business model of slight nonfuel operating margin expansion on an annual basis. It does reflect the management of our operations in a consistent manner that has allowed us to grow Kroger's business through a severe recession and a very slow economic recovery.  Dave has shared Kroger's strategy with you. I'll outline some specific growth objectives for fiscal 2011. For the full year, we anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4%. This will be driven by moderate tonnage growth and product cost inflation. Full year net earnings are expected to range from $1.80 to $1.92 per diluted share. While this range is narrower than our guidance for fiscal 2010, much uncertainty remains.  Improved operating results and share repurchases will produce Kroger's EPS growth in 2011. The amount of growth will be influenced by the factors that Dave described, the pace of the economic recovery, the impact of rising gasoline and food prices on customer spending, the competitive environment, higher pension and healthcare costs and retail fuel margins.  Our guidance for fiscal 2011 assumes a margin of approximately $0.115 per gallon for Kroger's retail fuel operations. This compares to our five-year historical average of $0.122 per gallon. Favorable developments in these areas could result in EPS growth toward the upper end of our guidance range. Conversely, unfavorable developments in these areas could lead to EPS growth toward the lower end of our guidance.  Kroger's earnings per share growth will also be affected by the pace and timing of our share buyback activity throughout the fiscal year. While we don't provide quarterly EPS guidance, we do like to share some insight on how our earnings per share growth rates will trend during the year. I want to point out that the growth rates in the second and third quarters will be lower than the full year rate due to the tax benefits recognized in 2010.  We expect Kroger's full year operating margin rate in 2011, excluding fuel, will be comparable to fiscal 2010 results. We recognize the need to expand Kroger's nonfuel operating margin rate over time. It remains our goal to do so as the economy and operating environment improve.  During 2011, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures, repay debt maturing on April 1, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating.  We have reduced our previous capital spending plans for the year by approximately $100 million to $300 million to our current expectation for capital investment of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the year. This reduction, plus not having to make a required contribution to Kroger's company-sponsored pension plan, should provide the incremental cash flow necessary to execute our financial strategy in 2011. I'll provide some additional details on Kroger's share repurchase program.  During the fourth quarter, we invested $253.4 million to repurchase 11.8 million shares of Kroger stock at an average price of $21.51 per share. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger invested $87.5 million to repurchase 3.9 million shares, leaving $11.6 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in June of 2010. We intend to invest this amount plus the additional $1 billion authorization announced earlier today to repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases will vary according to market conditions and keep in mind that the ultimate numbers of shares repurchased will depend on Kroger's stock price.  This morning, we filed an 8-K summarizing the guidance and the financial strategy that I've just discussed and some additional items, including LIFO expense, pension contributions and expense and tax rate.  Now I will turn it back to Dave.
David Dillon: Thanks, Mike. I hope our comments today help outline our view for 2011 and our long-term business objectives. Remember that Kroger's strategy focuses on driving sales through increasingly loyal customers. We continue to grow our business in a difficult operating environment through our focus on all four areas of our Customer 1st strategy, our people, prices, products and shopping experience. Our unique customer insights help us understand and meet each shopper's needs.  In 2010, we achieved solid, positive identical supermarket sales and market share growth, which demonstrates that we can strengthen our business and reward shareholders by placing our customers' needs first.  Now we look forward to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig of Citi.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: What do you think will be the impact of inflation on spending? And I'm sure you've done a lot of work on this with dunnhumby.
David Dillon: It's going to be a little hard to read in advance, of course, because on one hand, you have some products that we know for sure, things like milk, when the retail price goes up, tonnage on that product has historically always gone down. But some other products don't seem to vary too much particularly if the price changes aren't significant. What we were particularly pleased with as we’ve begun to see some return of grocery inflation as opposed to the deflation we've been experiencing, we still saw in the fourth quarter solid tonnage growth, and of course, the identical sales were strong too. So I'd say I'm pretty bullish and optimistic about where this can lead. However, we're cautious because we do think we have a fragile economy, and we've seen many of our customers who are greatly affected by that. Rodney, you want to add anything?
Rodney McMullen: The only thing I would add is obviously that the amount of inflation would affect that so if it's 3% to 4% overall it’s one thing. If it happens to be 10% or above I think it's something different. The other thing that we believe and we see customers continuing to do this is as prices increase, our own corporate brand program offers an alternative. And at many times, that item will even be cheaper than where the customer was spending before when they were buying the national brand item. So we believe both of those things will help offset or minimize the impact. But obviously, the amount of inflation will drive that, in answer to your question, by a lot.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: Okay, and then we appreciate the color you provided on the number of markets that you're gaining share. Can you also provide some color on the categories that you plan to retain the most share in?
David Dillon: Well, I think probably the best insight to that is the departments that we identified when sales have grown although there are some of those, for instance, produce that have spotty inflation and means that would have driven some of that, but I think that’s the best indication of where we're growing, for instance, Deli Bakery is a good example. We believe we've improved clearly, our market share, if you could even define market share there, of products, for instance, ready-to-eat products, those are things that often fastfood restaurants offer and other restaurants offer. And you pull some market share from those areas both for convenience and because of price.
Rodney McMullen: And the only thing I would add is it's very broad based. It's not just one or two categories driving it, but if you look across, all together we define about 250 categories. And by far, the majority of those categories would be gaining share.
David Dillon: And I think maybe the most clear picture are three facts. First is that all of our divisions had identical sales growth. Second is all of our departments had positive identical sales growth and third is that we grew both loyal and nonloyal customers as we calculate those, and that the nonloyals produced a proportionately stronger result.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc: And then lastly, obviously we’re in a difficult environment for the consumer as it relates to gas prices. I think you've always done a fantastic job as it relates to fuel rewards. Can you talk about anything that you're doing in terms of making sure the consumer is aware of your fuel rewards and anything you are doing differently in 2011 as it relates to that?
David Dillon: Well, we highlighted the thousand fuel stations at our supermarkets. And of course, we have many hundreds in our C-stores as well. And the convenience of having our gasoline is actually a big plus at a time when fuel prices are high, people look for having to drive less distance both for fuel and for food. And so we think that actually plays well, and of course, our fuel rewards are some help too.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: Hey guys, couple of things. It sounds like both in word and practice, many companies are acting very rationally today in terms of inflation pass through in stark contrast to maybe where we were a year ago. Why do you think that is? Is it kind of lessons learned with regard to limited demand elasticity? And is it something that continues or do those lessons ebb over time? Because it is kind of stark the way people are acting today, competitors versus what a lot of people were doing a year ago.
J. Schlotman: I tend to think, John, that really what's happening is as we move from grocery in particular, a deflationary environment to more of inflation and it’s persistent, that means it's across lots of items because it affects some of the ingredients that are going into the products. I think most people have seen that in order to make any kind of a decent result for the year, they're going to have to pass those things along as best they can. The real question for manufacturers is going to be what happens to tonnage. The advantage, as Rodney described, the advantage for us though is with Kroger brand, if the prices get too far out of whack more than what the costs justify, our Kroger brand has an advantage. And even if costs go up for both our brand and national brand, our brand also has an advantage because it’s a lower price. So I think the real question’s what happens with tonnage, but I think people are being more rational and I think it’s because they just recognize that, that’s the environment we're in and you have to be more rational.
Rodney McMullen: And the only other thing I would add is if you look at everything out there, it looks like the inflation is going to be there for a while. So if you go back and look at a year or two ago, an awful lot of the things where the inflation was happening look like something that was really only maybe a few months in duration and it wasn't permanent. For now, it just looks much more permanent in terms of the inflation as you look out six to 12 months, you just see actually more of it coming rather than less of it coming. So I believe that's probably driving part of the behavior.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: And how do you gauge or get comfortable with your customers' ability to absorb food inflation, gas? I mean it sounds funny, you walk through any retailer and so towels going up and appliances are going up because there's input costs there too. How do you kind of gauge that and remain sensitive to their ability to absorb it now. And then going forward, is it possible to get to a point where just less of it can be passed through later this year, next year just because that, particularly the low-income customer’s under some stress?
David Dillon: I think the answer really is a much like what we found as we went into the recession. At first, customers make choices. They go through a rational way of thinking, how do I get through this. And sometimes they trade to different products, sometimes they trade to different retailers, sometimes they completely revise what they decide they're going to consume in their family. But the real advantage for us is the way we're able to get insight into segmented customer groups so that we can see that change of behavior. So for instance, the best illustration of this is that a number of our customers, mainstream and upscale kind of customers, are feeling a little better about the economy. We described that last quarter and it's still true today, things like Starbucks have improved within our stores. More said [ph] has improved, natural food is up strongly and is growing households as an example. So many of those areas continue just like we described before. But those are typically among customers who are feeling a little less affected by the economy. But there are many customers who are more price sensitive, who are greatly affected even still today, high unemployment and food stamps, illustrate that best. And the way we segment customers through our insight data allows us to see more clearly how that behavior changes. So we try to address that both with what we offer on pricing. We try to address that with what we do with our ads. We try to address it in what we offer in the stores.
Rodney McMullen: The only other thing, Dave, I'd add to that, if you look there's also categories that we can take business away from, if you look at like restaurant. Now you can come to one of our stores and get a high-quality good-for-you meal at a third to half the price a restaurant would be, that really doesn't take any longer to prepare than what it takes for a customer to drive to a restaurant and get to their home, back to their home to eat it. So there's a lot of business out there to be moved from completely outside of our channel back into our channel too.
David Dillon: And I think you also commented, with your comment about what happens with fuel prices and how does that affect behavior? That's important to note. That's one of the factors we have identified for this next year that could cause depending on, which way it goes, could cause a change in how we see the results either at the high end or low end of our results. And it illustrates why we think there's some uncertainty out there that we’ve got to be a little cautious about. But we intend to be flexible, we intend to adjust as we go and we intend to read the market as we go through it in order to make the year come out strong.
John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC: One final question. It doesn't look like there was a lot of forward bought inventory in the quarter, that may not be right, but to what degree are you seeing opportunities there? Do you think you will see opportunities in 2011, and is that significant?
J. Schlotman: There will be opportunities. We continue to do it whenever it makes economic sense. We would have a pretty elaborate model in terms of looking at the expected cost increases and the cost to actually handle the inventory and inventory it. So we would expect to continue to see opportunities there that isn't the piece that's going to drive our success one way or the other as you look to 2011 and the estimates.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of BMO Capital.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just wondering back to the inflation, the topic today. Within your 3% to 4%, can you just comment on what you're expecting in inflation for the year? And then could you also just elaborate a little bit on what the center-store inflation is within that guidance?
J. Schlotman: Karen, at this point what we would expect would be 1% to 2-ish% depending on the category like Rodney said earlier in the comments if you have -- we have a lot of inflation going on for instance right now and produce with the horrible weather we've had not only in the States and some important growing regions, but South America as well. Most things cycle themselves throughout the year as new areas of crops come to market and those will settle down. But our expectation for core inflation would be in the 1% to 2% range for the year.
David Dillon: And center store, certainly last year, we actually, as many of you, expected to see inflation arise earlier in the year in grocery, for instance, and it didn't. But we do think it's starting, well it obviously is starting to show up now and we do expect that will continue through the year.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, and then looking just into the first quarter, I don't know if you could give some comments on sales trends and maybe also just elaborate within the first quarter and within the fourth, was there any benefit from storms?
David Dillon: Yes, I'd be happy to. Through so far year-to-date, we're through, what, about 4½ weeks, I guess. We've seen our sales consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter and that would put them near the high end of the range of guidance we've given. We did see clearly some effects of snowstorms. We believe, although I don't know that I've gone to look actually at the data but I certainly have every reason to believe that the snowstorms produced a little bit of improvement in sales so far this quarter and also in the fourth quarter beyond what we achieved last year. So I think that probably brings you up to date.
Rodney McMullen: Karen, sorry. On the weather that people in the East have seen, we haven't had that extreme of a winter so I would agree completely with Dave's comments but the weather extremes that we've had in the West and Midwest...
David Dillon: Sometimes we forget where they are.
Rodney McMullen: It isn't anything like what the East has.
J. Schlotman: It helped, weather, but it was not the primary driver, by any means.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, and then what are you guys seeing in terms of vendor support, in terms of helping you offset some of the price increases? Because it would seem that -- I mean Safeway vendor support in the fourth quarter was very high. I don't know if you could comment on that a little bit, about yours.
J. Schlotman: Yes. We would continue to see strong vendor support. I mean the vendors are working just as hard as what we are in terms of trying to improve the productivity of their business and making sure they minimize the cost increases just as what we would do. And you see a lot of that in terms of maybe increased list price but also increased promotional support and we would be seeing the same type of activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I was wondering since we've been talking a fair amount about food inflation, I remember that mid-2007 you folks had talked about dry-grocery inflation, which seemed structural at the time, as being a modest tailwind. And then I think we continued to see that through most of '08 and even part of '09 but I don't think it had the same benefit. Can we talk a little bit about why that was different than you think it will be now?
David Dillon: Well, we, if I'm understanding your question right, we had deflation in the latter part of that time period that you were describing.
Rodney McMullen: Meredith, I think you're going further back, right?
David Dillon: Okay. So if you go back to where we had inflation, I think our view was when we had grocery inflation that it was a modest tailwind and I would describe it as a modest tailwind today too. And it's sort of clouded with some noise in the numbers too. One of the reasons we described to you the $200 million of healthcare and pension incremental cost in 2011 was to illustrate that, that sort of hides some of the benefits that we might get from that inflation. That's a pretty big barrier to get over. Now we think we're going to get over it, but we thought it was big enough that we should separately identify it. So I would say that it's just like we described back in '07 is we do expect to get some modest tailwind from this. Now some of the categories you can get inflation in can work to your disadvantage occasionally, and that's generally true in perishable products. Sometimes it's true in milk, and one of the time periods you described I think it was a milk issue, where the prices were strongly competitive in the market on milk. And when that happens, inflation may not be as much of a tailwind as we have described.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay, great. And then I have one very quick question and a slightly longer one. Does your 6% to 8% long-term outlook for earnings per share include the benefit of stock buybacks or is that before?
J. Schlotman: It would include any benefit of stock buybacks but would be before dividend.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just real quickly, you did renew a number of contracts in the fourth quarter, you don't have too many up for renewal this coming year. Are there any contracts that were -- haven't been renegotiated and just been pushed out, where the negotiation is taking longer than expected?
J. Schlotman: Not a whole bunch that would be material. And obviously, when you look at 2011, there's not a lot in numbers of contracts but there's a lot of associates that are involved in those contracts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Jefferies & Company.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: So I kind of go down this route sometimes because I was just down in Western Virginia and listening to people talk about not going to the supermarket but going to the Kroger. And it just always occurs to me, and I saw you guys set out, is the bar just being set too low? I look at your pricing and you're just as good as the mass merchants, especially to your best customers, your meats and produce are better, service is generally quite good. I obviously could go on. So I guess I just look at that 68%, which includes buybacks and it just occurs to me maybe it's just too modest. And I just guess wanted to get your thoughts on that.
David Dillon: Well, we obviously don't think it's too modest or we wouldn't have set the bar at that level. We obviously think that there is certainly upside potential to that but what we're trying to do is describe what we see as the operating environment over the foreseeable future really looking forward. And some of those barriers like the medical cost we talked about, get in the way of being able to jump past those kind of numbers like you were describing. But on the whole, I hope that you see it as rather than conservatism or setting the bar too low, I think we're pretty optimistic and we're trying to describe something more consistent and we're trying to describe something less volatile than what you often experience with other stocks in the S&P 500.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Kind of as a follow-up and I don't think I saw anything on the release as far as like growth plans whether in market or out of market. And I'm also I'm including both store building and acquisition, I know you took down your CapEx a little bit but I was wondering what your -- if you have any plans, obviously you do, if you want to share any of your plans for kind of growth, generally speaking?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, we would be projecting a 1% to 1 ½% square footage growth, 130 to 140 remodels and around 30 or so net new relocated and expanded stores.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And one final one if I could. I know you guys have mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks some positive mix trends, natural organic, among others. I was wondering just that should be helping your margins but the one thing that stuck out to me, is that I think I heard that you said the basket really wasn't growing all that much. It's really coming from a lot of traffic unless I – I may have misinterpreted that. So I guess as I look at you're going forward, is trade-off and mix, could that completely maybe offset any per item retail to wholesale compression if you get a better consumer adding more to their basket?
Rodney McMullen: What I said was per visit it was a modest decline in number of items in a basket, but we're getting more visits. So when you look at a household over the month, we have strong growth in household over the month. And if you look at loyal households, that growth is stronger than it is in total. So the strength is in the loyals. But we believe a lot of that is just budgeting where people are not buying quite as much when they shop each time and they're shopping more frequently. Now if you look at the quarter overall, about half the growth was driven by spend per customer, half of it was driven by the number of visits we had overall for the quarter approximately.
Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And any thoughts on whether trade-off could really -- and maybe more items in the basket could help you out if we get a lot of job growth next year?
Rodney McMullen: Well, job growth I think would be good for all of us if we get it, not just Kroger, but all retailers. And as Dave outlined in his prepared remarks, we really expect that growth to be modest. Anything above that I think would be tailwind and would be really for all of us to have but we're not depending on that to grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America.
Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch: Really just two quick questions. I guess the first one is I was hoping you could maybe sort of reconcile the flat operating margin x fuel in 2011 on a 3% to 4% iden [ph]. Is the selling gross margin assumption sort of baked in to be down within that? Or is it strictly some of the expense pressures you mentioned? And then the second and sort of separate question would just be the natural food trend you pointed out, are any significant new initiatives in that category in 2011 that could accelerate that growth within your mix?
David Dillon: Well, the flattish operating margin for 2011 is really calling it how we see it in the current environment with some of the expenses that we described. And I think it’s the headwind of those expenses that probably weigh pretty heavily on that but I wouldn't put too much on the idea of flat. We think that can vary depending on where we come in, in the range and depending on the factors that we outlined. We could do more. We could do better if those factors go our way. We certainly wouldn't rule that out and we're just calling it like we see it at the moment.
Rodney McMullen: On the natural food trend, there would be new initiatives, that's part of our plan. But we've had new initiatives on natural foods probably for the last five or six years for sure. I'm sure it's longer than that. And it would just be a continuation of understanding what the customer wants and needs are, trying to provide that and by providing that it's just one less place the customer has to go.
Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch: And just a quick follow-up, David, so should we sort of expect the selling gross margin to generally still be under pressure in 2011?
Rodney McMullen: We're purposely not giving any guidance on selling, gross margin and OG&A rate and trying to get everybody to focus on the operating profit margin. And as Dave said, or currently the way we see it is flattish and it's primarily the result of the headwinds of those expenses we talked about. Keep in mind, $200 million of incremental expense in those two categories, that's $0.20 a share that we have to overcome before we make any new money next year and that's certainly weighing in on the estimates we gave you relative to all those metrics.
David Dillon: And I would also emphasize what Mike said in his prepared comments about that we recognize our need to expand operating profit margin over time as the economy and the operating environment improve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom of JPMorgan.
Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I was just wondering if you could kind of flush out the elasticity that you've seen in the grocery category as you've seen prices move up over the past few months.
Rodney McMullen: Well, if you look at the elasticity, it really is different based on the category. So if you look at like produce, you would have one set of elasticity. But part of that is driven because when produce prices go up, the quality goes down. If you look at meat, it wouldn't be so much the quality changes, it's just the higher price point, you'll see a lot of people switch from beef to pork, pork to chicken so they're switching proteins. If you look at milk, you still see people not buying milk and they'll be buying more soft drinks. So it really is different by category and the amount of elasticity is different by category. I realize that doesn't answer your question directly but it's very hard. Each category has a little different and that's one of the things that we try to make sure is that we give the customer a choice and we give the customer a high quality choice where they can switch as what meets their needs and budget versus what we try to force them to do.
David Dillon: The fortunate part is that many of the choices that they make are still within our store.
Rodney McMullen: Except for the restaurants and that's a switch to us.
David Dillon: Yes. That's a net plus.
Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then just my second question is when you take a step back and look at 2010 operating margins, 2.7%, 60, 70 bps below where you were four, five years ago. Do you look at the 2.7% as sort of a reset, in other words that's kind of where the operating margin structure of the company is going to be over the next, say, three to five years or do you think that over time, you get back to that 3.3%, 3.4% range?
David Dillon: I would just repeat the comment that Mike made earlier that we recognize, clearly, we recognize the need to expand our operating profit margin over time. So we are not satisfied with, do not believe that today's level is a permanent position. And that we think that, that opportunity to expand will improve as the economy and the operating environment improve.
Rodney McMullen: The only thing that I would remind all of us to look at, if you just look at the face of the financials, fuel also has a very low operating margin. So some of that, depending which number you're using, part of that change is driven because fuel is a higher percent of the business. Now when you adjust out fuel, Dave's comment is absolutely correct. So I don't want to try to erase anything that Dave just said.
David Dillon: I'm glad you added that because I literally take fuel out and treat it as a separate item all the time and just mentally assume that you did too. And if you don't, you should. It's the only way to understand our business, is to take fuel out and look at it as a separate category.
J. Schlotman: Particularly with the growth in fuel sales dollars.
Charles Grom - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Then just my final question is when you look at the comp guidance 3% to 4%, let's say things come in better, let's say that your IDs are 5%, what's the  [Audio Gap]
Rodney McMullen: But it's not just one segment where our business is improving, it's improving across all the segments, which is one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure everybody understood that because we believe our strategy connects with all customers, not just a customer niche.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly of Crédit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: My first question is on share repurchase. Mike, your tone seems to be a little bit better today than what I would say I've heard from you over the last few quarters. Would you agree with that?
J. Schlotman: Tone as far as...
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: What you think the opportunity is you can do in share repurchase in the upcoming year?
J. Schlotman: Well, we spent $545 million or so this year in that neighborhood. We've modified our capital expenditure program by $100 million to $300 million and there's about $140 million contribution we made to the company pension plan last year that we don't have to make this year where the funding status doesn't require us to make a contribution. So when you look at what we were able to spend in '10 and still maintain and improve our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio coverage, and the fact that those two items generate $240 to $440 of incremental free cash flow to spend on something else, clearly, we have devised a financial strategy in the short run to allow us to have that flexibility to spend a little bit more on stock.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, great. And Dave, kind of similar question for you. When I saw you guys in December or I should say you sounded more upbeat today than when I saw you in December and I was just curious, am I reading that right? And maybe you could talk about why?
David Dillon: The answer is yes, I am more upbeat and I think that, that's a direct result of what we saw in the fourth quarter from the time that we reported before to this time of reporting.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: And on the CapEx side, you lowered your CapEx guidance for this year. 2010 was below where you thought it was going to be initially. Could you talk about where the savings are coming from? And is there a possibility that this could come down further over time going forward?
J. Schlotman: Yes, we purposely didn't give any guidance on future years, which we've done in the past. Can it come down over time? Anything is possible. One of the things we continue to want to make sure of is the dollars we're spending on capital that we're generating the returns we expect to return. And so long as we continue to have satisfactory returns on capital, we'll maintain a fairly strong capital expenditure program and I think it's important to continue to remodel our stores. Another source of the savings is we want to focus on remodels probably a touch more than we have on net new and relocateds over the last several years. The other thing to keep in mind is unless you want to pay a penalty to get out of things you have in the pipeline, it takes a little while to temper a capital expenditure program, particularly as it relates to new, relocated and expanded stores. And we clearly aren’t in the position of having to raise cash so severely that we need to pay a penalty to do it. So we're being thoughtful on which projects get moved forward to the top of the list and which ones we have the ability to delay a little bit to create the incremental cash flow in the near term.
Edward Kelly - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And just very quick last question for you, multi-employer plans, your $300 million contribution in '11, how does that compare to '10?
J. Schlotman: $30 million to $40 million more than '10. So not a huge increase in the use of cash.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Looking at this fuel price inflation that might go away in a month but probably won’t, when you look at the trade-off between convenience of the customer being able to buy fuel at your supermarkets or C-stores and the cost savings that they might get from being in the rewards program, but at the same time that, that inflation might be eroding their in-store purchasing power. How do you come down on that, Dave and Rodney and Mike, when you're evaluating that and providing an outlook?
David Dillon: Well, you described the right balance to think through. And on a relative basis, I think we come out as a net-net positive. The question is, though, how much money gets taken out of the system and how strongly does it affect consumer behavior? And while we really can't predict that, as we've described a lot of the trade-offs we saw in the recession time occurred in our store or from other places to our store. So it ended up actually working a little bit more favorable to us than you might have guessed. So even there, I'm cautiously optimistic.
Rodney McMullen: And certainly, if you look at a couple years ago when -- three years ago, when there was heavy increase in fuel prices, that was a net benefit for us. The economy is certainly softer today than it was then so how that affects will affect it today and depending on how job growth materializes, we think that will also affect it. So it's a great question but we still think it's pretty hard to answer.
David Dillon: Before we end the call today for everyone, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates, who we encourage to listen in on the call.  On behalf of our leadership team at Kroger, I want to thank you for your hard work to produce such a great result in 2010. You each played a part in delivering these strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 results. It was a year of remarkable achievements despite a difficult economy, you rallied and found fresh exciting ways to connect with our customers. You are the reason Kroger increased customer loyalty and achieved consistent, positive identical sales results each quarter.  We expect 2011 to be similarly challenging, and I appreciate your efforts to continue to grow our relationship with our customers.  So thank you, and let's all go out and feed the people. That completes the call today. Thank you, all, for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-12-02 10:00:00) =====
Executives: David Dillon – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen – President, Chief Operating Officer Michael Schlotman – Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Carin Fike – Director, Investor Relations
Analysts: Susan Anderson – Citigroup Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research  John Feeney – Janney Capital Markets Neil Currie - UBS 
Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2010 The Kroger Company Earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. If at any time during the call you require audio assistance, please press star followed by zero and we will happy to assist you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. First I’d like to take a moment to express our thanks to those who came to our investor conference in Cincinnati. It was great to see you there and we hope you enjoyed our meeting, including a presentation by Clive Humby. If you weren’t there, you missed a lot. Before we begin today, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. Just as a reminder, in order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one topic with one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you. Now I will turn the call over to David Dillon, Kroger’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
David Dillon: Thank you, Carin, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger’s third quarter 2010 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We were pleased with Kroger’s third quarter results and believe they demonstrate the continued success of our Customer First strategy. Increases in identical sales, tonnage, and loyal household count show our core grocery business is strong and resilient. We also met our commitment to strike an appropriate balance between sales growth and margin investment, and we achieved operating margin leverage through sales growth and ongoing operating efficiencies.  I’m very pleased that Kroger increased both earnings and earnings per share for our investors in the third quarter. These results reflect our progress towards building a flexible customer-focused business model that can create shareholder value through sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow.  Kroger’s identical supermarket sales for the quarter increased 2.4% excluding fuel. Our associates produced these positive results in an environment that continues to be challenging for both retailers and customers. Some say the great recession is technically over. For Kroger, it’s not over until our customers say it is, and many of our customers continue to be cautious in their spending. At a time when many retailers are struggling to turn around negative identical sales trends, Kroger continues its exceptional identical sales record, now 28 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel. By listening closely to our customers, Kroger has created a variety of competitive advantages that collectively are very difficult for other retailers to replicate. The strength of Kroger’s identical sales results relative to many of our competitors trends strongly suggest we continue to gain market share.  Our positive identical sales growth continues to be broad-based across the store and nearly all markets. All departments experienced positive identical sales growth in the third quarter with the strongest increases in our nutrition, produce and deli bakery departments. Sixteen of our 18 supermarket divisions produced positive identical sales growth excluding fuel during the quarter. Of the two remaining divisions, one was essentially flat and the other experienced a slight decline. In a few minutes, Rodney will share some additional sales insights with you, including loyal household trends, tonnage growth, and performance of our exclusive store brands. First I’d like to update you, though, on the four major factors we told you at the beginning of the year would influence Kroger’s fiscal 2010 financial results. These factors are the economy and its effect on customer spending, food costs, competition, and fluctuating fuel margins. Mike will talk about the performance of our retail fuel operations in a few minutes. I’ll briefly discuss the trends we’ve seen in the other three areas. Overall, the economic recovery is slower and weaker than we anticipated it would be at this point in the year. Job growth remains elusive and fuel prices have risen. These factors affect consumer confidence and their grocery budgets, and many of our customers remain cautious in their discretionary spending. We continue to manage our business with the expectation that this economic environment will persist through the end of this fiscal year and throughout next year. Although the economy is sluggish, some food costs are rising. We’ve seen inflation in our meat, dairy and produce departments; however, our grocery department continues to experience deflation. Rodney will address this further in his remarks. The competitive environment remains challenging. Our unique competitive advantages, including our Customer First strategy, positioned Kroger to compete and win in this environment. While price is important, it is not the only factor that determines where customers spend their grocery dollars. They tell us the entire customer experience matters. That’s why we continue to invest in all four areas of our strategy to strengthen their loyalty to Kroger and our family of stores. This morning Kroger narrowed its identical sales guidance to a range of 2.5% to 3% for the year excluding fuel. The previous range was 2 to 3%. Three weeks into the fourth quarter, our identical sales are tracking a little above the upper end of this guidance; but it’s still early. For earnings, we have narrowed our guidance to a range of $1.65 to $1.78 per diluted share. We are striving for a result in the upper upper half of this range. This guidance reflects the fact that our customers remain cautious. We are off to a good start in the fourth quarter, but volatility from week to week remains high which makes predicting a narrower range difficult. While the competitive environment hasn’t worsened, competition remains intense. As always, the holidays are Kroger’s time to shine and our associates are focused on having our store stocked and ready for many holiday temptations and treats to meet the needs of every shopper, no matter how modest their budget. Rodney will now offer some more insight regarding our business trends during the third quarter. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with the results our Kroger team has achieved in a very challenging retail environment. I will provide some additional color behind our solid third quarter sales results, specifically on tonnage growth, food costs, customer shopping behavior, and labor relations. As Dave mentioned, Kroger’s third quarter identical sales rose 2.4% excluding fuel. This result was primarily driven by solid unit growth without much help from retail price inflation. Our stores sold more product units compared to the same period last year, a low single-digit increase. Keep in mind that this is on top of a very strong tonnage growth in the third quarter last year in the high single digits. In the grocery department, the increase was driven by positive growth in national brands. Corporate brand units in the grocery department declined slightly compared to very strong tonnage growth in the same period last year. We remain very confident in the outlook for strong future growth in this important part of our business. Corporate brands represented approximately 34% of grocery department units sold in the third quarter compared to roughly 35% in the same period last year. Corporate brands represented approximately 26% of grocery department sales, about flat versus third quarter 2009. Kroger’s corporate brands portfolio is best in class among U.S. retailers, and we believe this is a unique competitive advantage. Our goal is to continue building this portfolio and increase sales and increase sales of national brands. We do not view these objectives as mutually exclusive. Kroger’s unique portfolio of more than 20,000 corporate brand items combined with our strong partnership with national consumer goods companies helps us offer the variety and value our diverse customer base seeks. In the third quarter, we launched our new branding campaign for banner brand products with fresh packaging to appeal to shoppers. We added new items to our store brand line-up including Kroger Wholesome at Home meals for busy families. We also continued to reinvent our exclusive Private Selection line of premium foods. Just in time for the holidays, we added new seasonal ice cream flavors like New York Style Pumpkin Cheesecake and Strawberry Peppercorn. Yes, that’s Strawberry Peppercorn. It’s a wonderful, unexpected flavor and I strongly recommend you try it. It’s not just our customers who have noticed the enhancements we’ve made. The Private Label Manufacturers Association recently recognized Kroger as Retailer Innovator of the Year for winning entries in all four award categories – product development, packaging design, consumer marketing, and in-store merchandising. Congratulations to our corporate brands team for this honor. Now I will move on to food costs. We are seeing inflation in some of our perishable departments, as Dave mentioned, particularly meat and produce. De-inflation is persisting in our grocery department largely due to increased promotional spending by national brand suppliers. This promotional spending masks some of the list price increases we have received. The level of deflation is about 50 basis points if you exclude milk. Grocery represents about half of our supermarket business so this level of deflation has a meaningful impact on our total company results. Inflation in grocery has been slow to develop, but we still believe it’s coming. Many of you ask about Kroger’s ability to pass along product cost increases to customers, particularly at a time when shoppers are spending cautiously. We believe it depends on the product. We are passing on product cost increases from national brand suppliers in the grocery department today, and we will continue to do so.  Inflation in the perishable departments affects our business differently. In these areas, product costs are typically driven by short-term factors such as seasonality and product supplies, so product costs can vary from quarter to quarter.  I’d like to give you an update on our customer shopping behavior trends. In the third quarter, the total number of households we served continued to grow. In fact, more customers across all segments from value to upscale visited our stores compared to a year ago. This tell us that Kroger’s shopping experience and value proposition is striking a chord across a broad spectrum of shoppers.  While total household growth is important, we focused more attention and energy on increasing our number of loyal households. Kroger has been steadily increasing its number of loyal households for several years. In the third quarter, Kroger added loyal households at a faster rate than total households. The number of visits per loyal household remained about the same as a year ago, but the amount our loyal customers spend with us on a monthly basis continues to increase. This drives the solid identical sales results that Dave shared with you earlier. Kroger’s partnership with dunnhumby continues to help us make sense of our huge amount of customer data. We use this information to offer more compelling ads and weekly specials, and to offer the right product selection in our stores. Kroger has more insight in our customer behavior than most retailers today, and we use this data to reward them for shopping with us with special offers, coupon mailers, recall alerts, for example. Listening to our customer feedback and acting on what they tell us is a big part of our strategy. Every quarter we survey more than 50,000 households to find out what they like and don’t like.  Once again, we made steady progress in each of our four key areas in the third quarter. Our people, our prices, the products and services we offer, and the overall shopping experience in our stores. Now I’d like to give a brief update on labor. We also have good progress to report in labor relations. We successfully achieved agreements that offered solutions for associates and the Company while managing rising healthcare costs and stabilizing pensions. Most recently, our associates have ratified new agreements in Houston, Toledo, Cincinnati, and New Mexico. Logistics associates in southern California and non-food clerks in Portland, Oregon also ratified new contracts.  Finally, we reached an agreement with unions in Seattle and associates there are expected to ratify that agreement this week. Now Mike will offer more details on the quarter and Kroger’s financial strategy. Mike?
Michael Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, Kroger reported solid third quarter financial results that are consistent with the fiscal 2010 forecast we shared with investors in March. We believe these results demonstrate that we are managing our business well in an economic environment that hasn’t improved as we expected. Kroger’s third quarter net earnings were 202 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to $176.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share. In making that comparison, I am adjusting last year’s third quarter results for the non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $1.05 billion after tax that primarily resulted from a goodwill write-down.  Turning now to some details behind our third quarter earnings, FIFO gross margin excluding our retail fuel operations decreased 10 basis points. Supermarket selling gross margin excluding fuel declined 13 basis points. Recall that Kroger’s third quarter supermarket selling gross margin excluding fuel declined 109 basis points last year. An average of the two-year decline reflects a more normalized investment level for our business model. Delivering value to our customers through lower prices is an ongoing part of Kroger’s strategy. We are committed to improving Kroger’s price position relative to our competitive set. We believe this approach helps us grow market share and brings incremental profitable business to our enterprise. At the same time, we remain mindful of striking an appropriate balance between investments in all four keys of our Customer First strategy and near-term financial results. Excluding the impairment charges in fiscal 2009, Kroger’s third quarter non-fuel OG&A rate was 14 basis points lower than the same period last year, even as we continue to face the challenge of rising credit card fees, healthcare, and pension costs. Positive identical sales growth, good cost control, and our ongoing implementation of operating efficiencies produced this result. Identifying and executing sustainable operating cost reductions remains a critical element of our Customer First strategy. We will use these savings to improve our customer shopping experience and further grow our business. Kroger’s third quarter operating margin rose 6 basis points as a rate of sales excluding our retail fuel operations and adjusting for the 2009 impairment charges. This reflects the gross margin in OG&A performance that I just described plus approximately 4 basis points of additional sales leverage over rent and depreciation expense. Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin performance is consistent with the expectations we shared with you last quarter. It reflects sequential improvement in this measure as we transition back to a more normalized operating environment than we faced in the back half of fiscal 2009. Kroger’s third quarter tax rate was 31.7% this year compared to 35.9% for the same period last year when you adjust for the impairment charges in our prior year results. Our tax rate was lower this year primarily due to the resolution of certain tax issues during the quarter. This benefit added about a penny and a half to our third quarter earnings per diluted share. We now anticipate a full-year effective tax rate slightly below 35%. This rate includes the second and third quarter tax benefits. Dave has already commented on three of the four factors that are affecting our 2010 financial results. Fuel margins are the fourth factor, and so far these have been slightly stronger than we anticipated for the year. In the third quarter, our retail fuel operations benefited our total Company results by about a penny per share on a year-over-year basis. The cents per gallon fuel margin for the fourth quarter was approximately $0.127 compared to $0.119 for the same period last year. On a rolling four-quarter basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.121 compared with $0.107 in the comparable prior period. Our decades of experience in this business have taught us that fuel prices and margins are unpredictable, so we manage this business by focusing on gas gallons sold. On this measure, our retail fuel operations had another outstanding quarter. Both our supermarket fuel centers and C-stores produced solid identical gallon growth as customers continued to engage strongly in this component of Kroger’s overall value proposition.  Moving on to the Company’s financial strategy, Kroger’s operations generated strong free cash flow, and we believe it is important to allocate that cash flow among various priorities balanced in a manner to benefit our shareholders. Capital investment is one of those priorities. We firmly believe it is critical to invest in our business through new technology as well as other store improvements to ensure that we are the grocery retailer of choice. We now anticipate investing 1.8 to $2 billion in capital projects during the current fiscal year. This compares to our previous guidance of 1.9 to 2.1 billion. Our free cash flow allocation remains balanced across debt management, share repurchases, and dividends. We are firmly committed to Kroger’s investment-grade credit rating and manage the Company’s debt levels accordingly. At the end of the third quarter, we had reduced Kroger’s net total debt by almost $490 million compared to a year ago. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Kroger’s net total debt to EBITDA ratio adjusted for the impairment charges in 2009 was 1.93, which is consistent with the same period last year. Just after our third quarter ended, we closed on a new $2 billion, 3.5-year revolving credit facility. This speaks to the strength of our balance sheet and the success of Kroger’s business strategy.  While we believe our debt-management strategy creates long-term shareholder value, we remain committed to delivering near-term value to shareholders through our share buyback program. During the quarter, we invested $64 million of free cash flow to buy back 2.9 million shares at an average price of $21.72 per share. Kroger began its regular program of share buyback activity in January of 2000. Since then, we have invested $6.2 billion to repurchase 285 million shares of stock at an average price of $21.65 per share. That represents over 30% of the Company. I believe this track record demonstrates our commitment to the buyback. Kroger’s quarterly dividend is also an important part of our stock’s value proposition for investors, adding about 1.5 to 2% to total shareholder return. Since Kroger’s dividend program was initiated in March of 2006, a little over four years ago, our Board has increased the dividend four times. Our most recent increase was reflected in the dividend payment made to shareholders yesterday. It remains the Board’s objective to further increase the dividend over time with consideration given to the needs of the business, the interest of our shareholders, cash flow trends, and other factors.  Now Dave would like to make a few remarks before we take your questions. Dave?
David Dillon: Kroger’s third quarter results demonstrate that our team continues to perform well in a tough environment. If we step back and look at our results in the broad context of our Customer First strategy and our journey to create sustainable value for shareholders, I think we’ve accomplished a great deal. Our associates have weathered significant change in economic conditions and delivered steady results throughout. We firmly believe that taking care of our customers is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Whenever we delight our customers and exceed their expectations with lower prices, a faster and friendly checkout, or an amazing floral arrangement for a special occasion, we’re building loyalty and investing in the future growth of our business.  At the same time, we’re focused on creating a sustainable business model that rewards shareholders through solid near-term and future earnings growth, share repurchases, debt reduction, and dividends. Kroger continues to deliver value today while investing thoughtfully in our future. This is how we can ensure long-term success for our company and our shareholders. We now look forward to your questions.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you would like to withdraw your question, please press star followed by two. Once again, that is star, one for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig of Citi. Please go ahead.
Susan Anderson – Citigroup: Good morning everyone. It’s Susan Anderson on the line for Deb. 
David Dillon: Hi, Susan.
Susan Anderson – Citigroup: Hi. I’m wondering if you can talk about what’s behind, maybe—I know they only decelerated a little bit sequentially, but the ID sales trends going from 27 to 24, particularly given that deflation has eased a little bit.
David Dillon: Sure, be happy to. First, let me give you a perspective. If you look at the year, we went from a 24 this last quarter, 27 the quarter before and 24 in the first quarter. The 27 in that quarter, second quarter, included the Memorial Day holiday that was not in the preceding year, so it’s a little bit overstated. The way we look at it is we think we’ve had steady identical sales really through the year and I put it in the context of the four factors we talked about today and that we talked about the beginning of the year – that with the environment that we’re operating in, we did expect to have some caution in where those sales might be. But what we actually feel we’ve done is come out about the middle of the range we guided to, all the way to the present time. Now if you look at just the last few weeks, that might be helpful to you also. We indicated in the earlier comments that so far in our fourth quarter, in the first three and a half weeks or so in the fourth quarter, our current IDs without fuel are a little bit above the range we’ve given for the whole year, so that means we’re above the 3%. You’ve heard recently some other retailers describe some of their holiday sales just recently, and so to give you some context for us, our October business was better really than the average for the third quarter, so we were picking up at the end of the quarter. And the November business, which would include the last week of our third quarter and these first three and a half weeks that I’ve described, we’re better yet than October. So we’re seeing much the same kind of a pattern that’s been described by the retailers. Now, you wouldn’t see quite the high variability in a grocery food operator than you would in a non-food operator, but we’ve still seen that same general pattern. The caution that we have is that we’ve seen some variability among consumer spending really through the year where there are individual weeks or individual periods of time that can only be explained by consumers thinking they want to spend and then changing their mind and becoming a little more cautious; and we don’t see anything in the environment that causes us to change what that picture might look like.
Susan Anderson – Citigroup: Great, thanks. That’s really helpful. And then just one follow-up, I guess, based on the improving ID sales trends. If you look at the two-year stack on the earnings growth, it looks like that is also decelerating in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. I guess, what’s behind the thoughts that, you know, if ID sales are improving and getting better, that earnings would not be improving.
David Dillon: Again, I would back way up and look at the year as a whole and look at those four factors we talked about and the variability in those, the cautious customers. And if you had told me at the beginning of the year that of the four factors, that we’d have significant headwind on three of the four, and all but fuel really has been a headwind rather than a tailwind, I actually would have suggested guiding more to the bottom half of our guidance instead of the top half of our guidance. But as it’s turned out, even though we’ve had that headwind, I think our associates and our organization and our Customer First strategy have proven to be very resilient and have shown good, solid performance. Now I think the comparison to last year is a little bit difficult because we had some erratic numbers—differences from one quarter to the other last year, but on the whole I’m actually pleased with the directional position we’re in. I’m pleased at the results that we achieved in the quarter, and I look at it as a more favorable outcome given the environment that all of us are operating in.
Susan Anderson – Citigroup: Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter you guys.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company: Hey guys. I wanted to kind of follow on some of those questions that were just asked. The midpoint—if I look at the midpoint of the guidance, it’s implying a pretty sharp deceleration in earnings growth from the third quarter and it sounds like you actually are pretty encouraged by the way things are going so far in the fourth quarter; and of course, last year’s fourth quarter was pretty awful. So I was just wondering, are you being just very, very cautious here or is this $0.13 variability we have in earnings as we’re almost four weeks in—is there that much unsure about the fourth quarter?
David Dillon: I guess I’d answer it basically the same way I did, although maybe with this additional point. Think about the high variability that we’ve seen in customer behavior, not in any—typically in any given week or month, but from one month to the next. Even in the third quarter, we had a few weeks in the middle of the quarter and nearer to the beginning of the quarter that were unexplainably low. And so we think that the range of possible outcomes is wider than you might normally expect. That’s why you saw us try to give you the range of where we could see. We could imagine some cases that could get you to at least some of that range. Certainly, our mindset is to the top half of that range and we are working to achieve the highest possible result in the setting; but we think that there are going to be points in the quarter, despite the fact that we and other retailers have had an uptick in November sales, we think there are going to be moments in the quarter that are unexplainably difficult and are really because the customers are being more cautious in today’s environment.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company: Okay. So getting back to the third quarter, I was a little surprised to see both a declining selling gross margin and a fairly sharp deceleration to your stacked comp. I guess, how do I square that? And then just going more into the selling gross margin which is flat, I think, sequentially, but actually deteriorated quite a bit on a two-year stack basis, I guess that surprised me as well because we are cycling some pretty insane milk promos from last year, so maybe you can give us a little insight into that selling gross margin. You know, did you take a step back because the competitive environment was a little tougher in the third quarter, and should we see that break positive in the fourth?
David Dillon: The competitive environment hasn’t gotten worse but it still remains intense, and we expect that will be true in the fourth quarter. It certainly was true in the third. I’d be surprised if it’s any different even next year. And so I don’t think that helps you in what you’re trying to describe. I tend to look at, from quarter to quarter, how are we seeing the business go and that flow; and at first glance, I could see where you could see the drop in our identical sales in the third quarter and conclude, well, that drop was driven by less of an investment in gross margin in the particular quarter, certainly compared to last year.  But I don’t actually think that that’s it. As I’ve indicated, I think the 24 is really more representative of what the year has been. We’re about 25 so far through that time period. So I think really we’ve been steady through the year with high variability being from month to month, occasional months have been down. The last two months have been reasonably strong. So I don’t think that it’s a case of reducing our investment and killing our sales. I actually think the sales have stayed strong and I think we’ve been careful to try to balance that investment so that we didn’t overspend; and I think we came out about where we had hoped to be in that regard.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company: And Dave, the sequential—you know, the stack selling gross margin actually deteriorating quite a bit. You know, we were going against, I think, a 109 or something last year where your selling gross margin had come down. I mean, what’s our thought of the fourth quarter? Are we going to actually finally see that at least on a one-year basis break positive?
David Dillon: Well, I’ll let Mike comment about the fourth quarter but what I think you should look at—first, you should look at the two years together. That’s a better way to think about it. But if you look at the way we’ve tried to build our business, we have for the last six or seven years invested more in gross margin. At first we invested a lot more and it came straight out of our operating profit margin, and other than the anomaly years, I think we are—certainly have an effort to slightly improve that operating profit margin. But our intent is to still invest and we invest by saving money, reducing our costs as a percent of sales and then reinvesting that, sometimes in price, sometimes in other areas. But that remains to be our intent, so it shouldn’t you surprise you at all that we had a slight decline in selling gross and we had a similar reduction in OG&A, and then we picked up some leverage on rent and depreciation. So that combination actually works pretty well. That’s pretty much what we’re trying to do. Mike, you want to comment about the fourth quarter?
Michael Schlotman: Yeah, I won’t get very specific on what we expect in the fourth quarter. I won’t predict if it’s going to be up or down. We did give guidance in our 8-K that we filed today for operating margin for the full year, and we actually expect the operating margin to be similar for the full year to where it is for the year-to-date. If you think about three quarters in, all but three periods, it takes a pretty big change in the fourth quarter either up or down to change the year-to-date third quarter results, and that’s where we would expect.  Scott, when you look at the two-year stacks, you’re correct that in the second quarter our two-year stack was about 101 basis points or so of investment in selling gross margin, and our two-year stack now is about 122 basis points. Keep in mind, we did say in our prepared remarks that the two-year—if you look at the average of the two years in the third quarter, that is within the range that we would expect to see on an annual kind of basis. What we have to do a better job at year-in, year-out is to not have 122—or 109 one quarter and 13 the next quarter, but to make it more ratable each and every year and each and every quarter so that you don’t see the fluctuations. 
Rodney McMullen: The other thing that I would add on top of that, if you look at the third quarter – and Dave mentioned it – is really balancing reduction in selling gross with our reduction in OG&A. And that’s really what we’re trying to do and get the leverage on rent and depreciation where we do have a slight expansion in operating margin which drives the earnings growth. But the other thing that Dave mentioned earlier is the volatility that we have from week to week is still significantly more than what we would have had in the past, and we’re really trying to make sure that we deal with those appropriately as we have those swings that are really based on what the customer is doing, not changing in competitive situation with the market. It’s really customer-based changes.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
David Dillon: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to the selling gross for a second. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the cadence of the selling gross margin investment throughout the quarter? Did you get more promotional as the quarter progressed or was it pretty steady state?
Michael Schlotman: Yeah, I don’t know—my view, Karen, is everybody always wants –and I’ll let Rodney give a little more color to this, but one of the things everybody has to keep in mind is a selling gross reduction doesn’t indicate a level of promotional activity. We’re trying to be very cognizant of how we go to market from a promotional standpoint. Our selling gross is intended to be permanent investments we make in giving our customers a better price day in, day out; and it’s driven as much by that as any particular promotional activity that we’re reacting to. What Rodney just said – our investments aren’t reflective of reacting to something that happens in the market. It’s our commitment to continuing to give our customers a better price day in, day out over time.
Rodney McMullen: If you look at it within the quarter, it would be pretty consistent. The other thing that you always have to factor in is changes in mix. Obviously there are some products that we sell that have higher gross margins than others, which would also affect it; but if you look at the 13 basis points overall, it’s pretty consistent with where we expect it to be, and it was pretty consistent across the quarters. It would not have been driven by just promotional activity.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so looking at as you started the quarter, did you maybe have expectations that the environment would ease in the quarter and that you would be able to have a slightly less of a reduction in the selling gross; or, I mean, was this something that was in plan—in place well ahead of the quarter? I’m just trying to get a gauge.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I would say the plan is really more tied to what we were hoping and expecting for reducing costs by, and that’s really how we’re factoring in how much we think we can afford to spend from a gross standpoint. So it’s really looking at selling gross and cost reductions together in terms of where we anticipate those to be, and trying to make sure those two are in balance.
Michael Schlotman: Our goal was to start growing operating margin again in the third quarter, which is what we in fact did because of the OG&A reductions and leverage on rent and depreciation that we had.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Right. And so it’s fair to say, then, the quarter did more or less shake out in line with your internal expectations?
Rodney McMullen: Certainly if you look at it relative to as we started out the third quarter. Now, if you looked at it when we set out our objectives for the whole year in 2010, we were expecting in the second half of the year to have a little more inflation than what we’re seeing, a little more job growth than what we’re seeing, and an economy that was improving rather than just really staying kind of flat and stagnant. So when you look at it in March when we set out the original goals and objectives for 2010, we would have expected the second half of the year to look better than what it was in the third quarter, what it looks like the fourth quarter will be.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Right, that’s fair. Okay. And then just wondering if you could comment on the comp. Could you just decompose it a little bit between traffic and basket; and then in terms of what you are now seeing in the fourth quarter – where is the improvement coming from? Thanks.
David Dillon: Yes, we have a slight increase in the average sale, that is the total sales divided by customer so you get an idea of what each person buys. The increase, it’s just slight. It’s like three quarters of 1%. And our transaction count, which is just the raw count of transactions going through the register, was up over 2% for the quarter, so you can see it was driven much more by that. If you look at our dunnhumby data, it’s the same thing – our results, our identical sales were driven by increasing number of loyal households and increasing number of total households. Now, it’ also a good sign, we think, that our loyal households grew at a faster pace than our total households grew, and that’s always good news in our mind; but that was driven by a growing number of people who were shopping with Kroger. 
Rodney McMullen: And it’s customers that are loyal to Kroger, and they’re more loyal to us this quarter than they were second quarter and the third quarter of last year. So we think that’s really important because obviously those are customers that aren’t cherry-pickers. They’re buying more than just what you have on promotion. They’re really experiencing the whole Kroger experience. And what we’re finding is once we get those customers to us, over time they continue to increase their spending.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: And that’s the same thing for the trends so far in the fourth quarter? It was loyal household customer driven?
David Dillon: I don’t have that in front of me, and I’m not sure we’re going to want to add comments to that, unless you want to add anything.
Rodney McMullen: Well, let’s just say we wouldn’t have that level of detail yet relative to the last three weeks. That’s stuff that really comes out on a four-week cycle, so we really don’t have that level of detail. If you look at the raw numbers that Dave referenced initially, the mix would still continue to be strong both between what people are spending, the number of visits, and spending per visit. So so far, a nice balance.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Dillon: Thanks, Karen.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hi David. I was hoping you could comment or give color on the sort of spread between pricing of the national brands when you include promos versus your corporate brands, and if that affected the relative momentum of corporate brands in the quarter? And then maybe speak to—you know, into the fourth quarter or even into next year, when you factor in your expected promo outlook for the corporate brands—sorry, for the national brands, what you think—how you think that all is going to play out? Thanks.
David Dillon: I’ll give you just a—kind of a top line overview, which you’ve heard some of already, and then I’ll ask Rodney to add some color that he might want to add here. But as we said, during the quarter we saw the national brand tonnage units were up reasonably well, and that our Kroger brand units were actually slightly down, and we think that’s in part because of the comparison against last year when Kroger brand units were real strong. We also think it’s in part because of the investment in promotional money that the national brands have made, which Rodney also referenced. That has tended to encourage additional national brand sales. I also think it’s a partial indication of some of the customer base seeing that the world around them has improved. I wouldn’t read too much into that, but I think there is a little bit of that that is naturally going to happen as some individuals see their world improving. It’s just that we’re seeing high variability among our customers in terms of that impression of improvement. Rodney, you want to add some color?
Rodney McMullen: Yeah. Robbie, the only thing I would add—a couple things I would add on Dave’s comments. If you remember a year ago, corporate brands was picking up huge share. The national brand folks were increasing prices or not reducing prices as some of the deflation that was happening out there, and we thought they were really probably making more profit than they deserved. I think customers reacted by buying a lot more corporate brands, and the rate of growth in corporate brands was significantly more than anything we would have historically expected or experienced. So I think part of it is the national brand folks got tired of losing share and they’re getting more aggressive on some of the promotional activities that I mentioned before.  The other thing that I would add on the corporate brands is a big chunk of corporate brand tonnage is dairy, especially milk, and milk is significantly higher this year than a year ago. And whenever you have that kind of increase, you’ll always have tonnage declines because people will go back to drinking soft drinks or whatever else versus milk when milk is much higher. So a lot of that was driven by the changes in the milk category.
Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And just a quick follow-up – as you look to next year and the national brands would obviously be looking to get their prices up, how does the mechanism for that work in terms of less promos versus list prices? And then also, how do you execute that with your loyal households, or how is the response of your loyal households to sort of migrating prices up with national brands versus your average customers?
David Dillon: Well, I hear—part of your question seems to me is to what extent do we think we can pass through costs as they are passed to us by our national brand vendors. Is that the essence of what you’re asking?
Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, I guess I was trying to ask that in a sneaky way, but maybe just some color on how you do that in loyal versus—
David Dillon: Well I’d be happy—I mean, I’ll give the answer to that straight up, is that when it comes to grocery-branded products, it’s fairly clear what we’re doing and how we’re approaching this is that as we have cost increases to us, whether it’s list cost or reduction of promotional spending, we are passing that through to our customers as the vendors give it to us. And therefore, in my opinion, what the consumer does with that is purely in the hands of the national vendors. So some items you will see when, if you raise prices, you will end up with less tonnage; and the vendors who raise those prices are going to have to deal with what happens with lower tonnage. I think the dynamics of whether they will spend more in promotional money or not will be almost an audible call on the field at the time by the vendors on what do they see in movement and what do they think they need to do. And some, I think, will respond by adding money to promotional spending, and some will respond by saying I guess I’ll take my lumps with the lower tonnage and just get through it.  But all of that spells the same picture, is that we view those choices as in the vendors’ hands. We push back where we think it’s appropriate to push back, but remember, we sell lots of other products; so when somebody raises a price on something and we pass it on to the customer, if that tonnage goes down, the customer most likely will switch to something else that we sell. Sometimes it’s Kroger brand, sometimes it’s a competing national brand; but in each case, our view is that the decision of retail price in that regard is up to them—up to the vendor, and we think we’re going to be able to pass through those and have so far shown success in doing that.
Rodney McMullen: I would just add one other comment to Dave’s, and you’ve heard us talk about this before, but we think it’s one of the really important parts of having such a strong corporate brand program overall. Any time a vendor puts a cost through that is not tied to the true economic costing changes, our private label always gains share; and it’s a lot harder for the national brand to get it back once somebody’s tried the corporate brand item. So for us, we believe that’s a huge advantage for us by having such a strong corporate brand program really across all categories, because whenever there is a cost increase that’s not tied to the true economics, over time it shows up in market share change.
David Dillon: That’s why really we’re happy to be selling more national brands and selling more Kroger brands. We like both of those sales.
Rodney McMullen: It’s our customers’ choice what they buy.
David Dillon: Right.
Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just the loyal household response to times where prices are going up versus the non-loyal customer response – is there any big variance?
Rodney McMullen: I wouldn’t say that you see much change in behavior in that regard, no.
Robert Ohmes – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks a lot.
Rodney McMullen: Mm-hmm. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thanks, Robbie.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: Yeah, hi. Good morning guys.
David Dillon: Good morning, Ed.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: You know, we’ve beat up this selling gross margin question pretty good, but I do have some follow-ups. Mike, I think you said something about the two-year stack selling gross margin of what we’re running at right now – this, I don’t know, call it 100, 120 basis points. It’s kind of what you target longer term. I don’t know if I heard that right. The reason I’m asking this is because I don’t think that was the case back in ’07 and ’08. I mean, that number was more like 50 basis points, so could you just clarify that?
Michael Schlotman: Sure. If you look at the two-year stack and average that on an annual basis, it’s in the 50 to 60 basis point range, and that is what we would desire to be able to reduce selling gross margin on an annual basis by and not have it be lumpy and have it 109 like it was last year’s third quarter and 13 like it is this year’s quarter, but have that be more in the 50, 60 basis points on a more regular basis. If you look at ’08, we had quarters as low as 9 and as high as 59; and if you look at ’07, we had one quarter were it actually went up and another quarter with a 48 basis point investment. So it has been erratic, but if you look at it—the way we try to look at it is to be in that kind of a range on an average annual basis each quarter.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, but I wouldn’t just look at selling gross by itself. One of the things we’re really trying to strive to do is be more consistent in terms of from quarter to quarter so we don’t have the volatility as much; and making sure that we’re really tying changes in selling gross to changes in taking costs out of our business. And that’s the reason why we think it’s so important looking at the operating margin; and when you look at the operating margin, that we do strive to have slightly increasing over time because that really that will flow through and create good value in earnings growth for our shareholders.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: Yeah, I guess that’s the longer term strategy, but I guess what I’m confused about is that, again, if I do go back to ’07 and ’08 – and Mike, you’re right. I mean, obviously it was volatile. Your two-year stack in both of those years was around 50 basis points which would imply that the selling is down 25 a year; and now you’re saying that the two-year stack is closer to 100, which is 50 basis points a year. So is there a fundamental shift in how much you plan on investing going forward, or am I just not looking at this right?
Michael Schlotman: Yeah, you also have—I wouldn’t say it’s a fundamental shift. That’s kind of our desire, and as Rodney said, our overall desire is to grow the operating margin; and we won’t manage the business to be in the 50 to 60 basis point range if we can’t find cost savings to pay for that. There is the desire and then how we’ll manage the business over time, and our goal is to grow the operating margin over time.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, when we first started this whole process, we didn’t really put a governor on it, but the governor on it today is what do we find in costs. And while that not be quarter to quarter - we’re looking at a little longer term than that – on an annual basis, that’s our effort. That’s our focus, is to try to balance us out a little bit better.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: All right. So regardless of what we’re investing in selling gross margin next year, you’re basically saying that the goal here is to get the operating margin up. 
Rodney McMullen: Yes. Up slightly.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: All right. Up slightly. Okay. And then also Q4, I know Thanksgiving was pretty much a mess last year. How did that go this year – your thinking about this?
Rodney McMullen: I think it would really tie into the comments that Dave made before. So far we’ve been pleased with where we are. It wouldn’t have been nearly as messy this year as last year, but it’s still early in the quarter. We still have eight and a half weeks left, and the volatility that we see from week to week and day to day continues to be high, so so far we’re happy with where we are. It wasn’t the mess that it was a year ago, but it’s still too early to declare success, I would say.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: And when we say it wasn’t the mess it was a year ago, that’s also a reflection of the margin as well, right?
Rodney McMullen: All of the above.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And the holiday season last year – you know, Christmas, New Year’s – was that a mess last year as well?
Rodney McMullen: No. If you remember a year ago, we talked about Thanksgiving was really tough and was the most difficult part of the quarter. The balance of the quarter was actually better, so it was really around the Thanksgiving period that would have been the worst. The other two holidays were pretty normal.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: Right. And then last question for you is back on this inflation topic. I think there’s a lot of debate in the market about whether supermarkets can or cannot pass it through, and I think what investors are doing is looking at the last year or so and saying we saw inflation in some categories and you had trouble passing it through. But I think what I’ve heard from you today was that that was in the perishable section where there is volatility, and maybe it is more difficult to pass prices through versus dry grocery center of the store where it’s a little bit easier to pass it through. And if we think about 2011, it’s really about re-inflation in dry grocery. So should we feel more comfortable with your ability to pass through prices next year than where we’ve been?
David Dillon: I think that you’ve correctly identified the two thought processes. If the categories you’re talking about are the perishable categories, and in that I would include fluid milk, you’re talking about something that varies regularly, sometimes daily, on prices; highly competitive, changes the tonnage rather quickly when you change your retail prices, and those get balanced out however they get balanced out through the year. Sometimes you end up worse off because of the competitive pressure; sometimes you end up better off, but whatever it is, that ends up being how it works out. The other category are the dry grocery or the branded products, and on those products I think you should think of that as a category almost unto itself. And the reason I describe it differently is because when you’re talking about being able to pass through prices, generally you’re really talking about – or should be talking about, I think – about when a vendor is giving us a cost increase that they’ve chosen to make, sometimes it’s driven by underlying commodity costs, sometimes not. And in those cases, I think it behaves very predictably, and that’s the inflation that we were referring to at the beginning of the year that we thought we’d see a little bit of as opposed to not seeing inflation.  I actually separate the perishables and, while I don’t ignore it, for purposes of whether we passed it through or not, I do. And so I think you’ve got to look at it that way, and I think that picture will roll out the same next year. We don’t know whether we’ll see the inflation or not. That’s a high variable for next year, but we definitely think that that’s a question that will have to be answered as we go through the year.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: If the brands in grocery raise prices, does your private label prices go up as well? I mean, you’re seeing the cost pressures, right?
David Dillon: It compares on the cost pressures.
Michael Schlotman: Usually we would see cost pressures faster in corporate brands than we do national brands because we’re actually procuring the raw materials.
David Dillon: Yeah. So where there’s cost pressures, you would see that, yes.
Michael Schlotman: And we see the other side too when it goes down.
Edward Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
David Dillon: Thanks, Ed. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Good morning, everyone.
David Dillon: Hi Chuck.
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: David, you’re talking about the economy recovering somewhat slower than you expected at the beginning of this year. How is that showing up in things like basket size, the customers’ item selection, various store departments, and even some of your geographies?
David Dillon: We’re seeing a lot of variability among our customers. Some customers have—for their world, things have improved, and the picture we described last quarter is the same picture I would describe today. Boars head meats have improved their sales; high-end wines have improved their sales, as examples. Nutrition, we already identified that as improving. Starbucks have increased their identical sales within our stores. All of those are examples of for some individuals, at least for those purchases, they see their world has changed a little because all those categories had suffered during the beginning of the recession. At the same time, though, we’re still seeing increases from the year before in food stamps used to purchase groceries. The percent of our business done on food stamps on the whole has continued to rise. It’s at an all-time high and roughly double—a little bit more than double, actually, where it was just a short three years ago or so. And those customers obviously are still suffering and having a difficult time making ends meet. So we’re customers all across the board in lots of different ways. Now across geography, as we mentioned, 16 of our 18 divisions had positive identical sales results, and of course there was some variability among those too. Of the two remaining, one was essentially flat and the other was just slightly down, and in some of those markets anyway I can see some economic headwind in the local markets that could help explain some of that result. So I don’t know if that helps give you a little more color, but that’s how we see the picture today.
Rodney McMullen: The only thing I’d add that makes things a little more complicated – if you think about some of the areas that Dave talked about improving, on boars head and some of those areas, some of that is also driven by people brown-bagging or taking their lunch to work, because you go to a Kroger’s store, pick up everything you need for lunch for $1 or $2 and have a very good lunch versus spending $4 or $5 if you go out somewhere, maybe $6. So some of that growth, I think, is because people are brown-bagging more, some of those kind of things too.
David Dillon: Yeah, definitely.
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Dave, would you care to give a—among your 18 divisions, care to give a range of comps from bottom to best?
David Dillon: No, thank you. 
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: All right.
David Dillon: Can’t blame you for asking, but no thank you.
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: If we look at the food inflation issue, do you see any sign of the CBGs reducing promotional spending as a way of reflecting higher input costs in a number of commodity areas?
David Dillon:  We can give you examples of CBG companies that are doing every behavior that you can describe, so yeah, there are some that are doing what you’re suggesting. On the whole, you could say that what we’re seeing is some additional spending, but we do continue to see list costs by many of the vendors going up and we continue to hear the comments and the sort of chatter in the outfield is that they believe, given some of the commodity cost increases they’ve experienced, that they need to pass some of that through. It’s just that we haven’t seen it yet. But that’s the same exact picture we’ve been hearing now for a couple of quarters, and I walked in today, I had the same conversation this morning here just to make sure that I had current information. And we have every reason to believe that CBG vendors want to increase their costs but very few of them really are actually doing it.
Charles Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: All right. Thank you very much.
David Dillon: Thank you, Chuck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Feeney of Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Feeney – Janney Capital Markets: Thank you very much. I just wanted to dig in on the difference between—you know, it seems like the single biggest promotional lever, competitive lever is discounting in perishables, and when you talk about the competitive environment over the course of the year, David, could you parse for me—both over the course of the year and recently as we’ve gone from a tough quarter to starting off this quarter better, has there been much change at the margin in terms of promotional behavior in perishables specifically, and therefore margins in perishables specifically, and within that dairy particularly, which seems to be the biggest single lever we see?
David Dillon: I wouldn’t characterize promotional spending in perishables as being the single biggest lever. It’s one lever, just as in branded goods is another and Kroger brand packaged goods is another too. I would characterize all of those—the difference really between the perishable and the non-perishable is the perishable works on a little shorter time frame because those costs change abruptly sometimes based on weather and so forth, and you’ll see that—it’s more of a gunfight because it’s quicker reaction, quicker changes, wherein branded products often we’ll plan those things out months ahead of time and have—because they want to plan production, they’ll have those plans already nailed down, and sometimes those will change but generally they don’t. So I don’t know that I can characterize the difference that you’re seeking. Rodney, you want to add any color to that?
Rodney McMullen: No. I mean, the volatility would be a little bit more in perishables but at the end of the day, the profitability really doesn’t change that much. But the weekly volatility would be more.
David Dillon: Right.
John Feeney – Janney Capital Markets: Yes, but I mean—I guess—I think that’s a totally fair comment, David, about how things should be and how things have been and will be over the long run. But over the near term, we think about some of this aggressive promotional activity by—you know, when people get a little bit panicked and want to, say, grocers that are not comping positively want to try to get some customers. I mean, that’s one thing you can reach for. I guess at the margin, has there been any change in that activity over the—just, say, the past three months? Have you seen less promotion in, like—
David Dillon: I don’t think it’s been materially different than it had been before. I think that’s why we described the competitive environment as continuing to be intense, but not worse. But it’s certainly not better either. I don’t think there’s much difference. 
John Feeney – Janney Capital Markets: Okay, that’s fair. Thank you, Dave.
David Dillon:  Mm-hmm, you’re welcome. Thank you. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie of UBS. Please go ahead.
Neil Currie – UBS: Thanks for taking my question. I don’t want to flog the dead horse of selling gross margin again, so I’ll ask the question in a different way if I can and talk about more general strategy. You always mention the word balanced about your approach to balancing shareholder and customer concerns, and obviously this time last year the balance went very much in favor of the customer where you admitted that you overinvested in pricing activity and your operating margin declined quite rapidly. Our worries at the time was that that margin was just going to be lost and it was never really going to be recovered, and whilst there has been some improvement in operating margin this year, given what happened to the selling gross margins, given what—you know, you’re still way below two years ago and third quarter margins previously. Can we safely assume that that overinvestment really is somewhat lost because you don’t seem to be—you don’t seem to have the appetite to recover that lost margin.
David Dillon: Well it sounds like from your question, Neil, that you’re defining recovery as a return to the previous gross margin percent.
Neil Currie – UBS: No, operating margin, because two years ago the operating margin was 2.9%.
David Dillon: Okay, operating margin. I believe, though, the way I would see recovery is in what happens with our sales over time and then what happens with our margin over time, not just the year to year. But look at the recession we’ve just gone through and think about the results of many of our competitors that had some rather serious declines from where they had been running in profit and operating profit. We didn’t have such—we had declines but not as serious of a decline, and as things begin to recover, that means our recovery, at least back to the par, isn’t going to snap back quite as abruptly. But our potential for the future, I think, is much greater because we have something to work with. We’ve got identical sales to work with, we’ve got customers who are rather permanently loyal customers at Kroger that continue to grow, and that gives us something to work with to which you can apply that operating profit margin. So I think it’s a combination of the improved operating profit margin, which we’ve seen some of, which we expect to see gradually more of over time, and the improvement in our customer traffic, customer behavior. Those two working together actually does give you the recovery that we’re seeking.
Neil Currie – UBS: Okay, and then just allied to that question, clearly you have got what I consider to be a much better business model than your competitors who are struggling, because you have lower prices and your margin structure reflects that. But in terms of, again, trying to get that balance right, if you take out the tax benefit—you know, the lower tax rate that you had this year, your EPS growth was 11% which is I think what you’d probably be targeting in a normal year, but you have a very easy comparison. My question is going to be basically in future years when you maybe don’t have the same OG&A declines that you saw this quarter, tougher compares on last year in terms of margin, can you continue to get that sales and margin balance right because your ID sales didn’t grow as fast as they have in the last couple of quarters. The two-year stack has deteriorated. I mean, can you—is this as good as it gets, really, is what I’m asking.
Rodney McMullen: Yeah, Neil, I think over time we would continue to expect to get the operating cost savings to pay for the investments and to be able to have the identical food store sales to leverage the numbers. Your correct that in the back half of last year, it’s really the back half of last year that’s causing the two-year stack deterioration; and as Dave said earlier, I think the trend in idents this year when you move Memorial Day and equalize the first quarter and second quarter, we’re actually quite consistent on identical food store sales this year.  One thing I do want to point out on the earnings per share where you take out the tax and it grew 11%, there were some unusual items in the OG&A as well. If you notice in the quarter, rent on the income statement went up this year versus a trend where it had been going down. We booked about $5 million of expense for some stores in northern California when Ralphs exited northern California or the subtenant defaulted on it, so that’s in the quarter as well; and there were some reserves put up for certain litigation issues as well. Just those two items entirely offset the benefit of the tax benefit, so that’s one of the reasons we were happy with the overall results in the quarter. Now, it was an 18% increase and you shouldn’t expect an 18% increase over time, but we think fundamentally it was a strong quarter in earnings per share growth, particularly given an environment where three of the four factors that we laid out at the beginning of the year could cause us to be at the low end of the range, and in fact we’ve narrowed our range and have continued to target above the midpoint of the original range. We think we’ve balanced it quite well in this environment, and—
Neil Currie – UBS: So another $0.02 of one times in there.
Rodney McMullen: Well, it’s almost—it’s about a penny and a half, and the tax benefit was about a penny and a half, just those items. We don’t go into those details on our releases or our call because the way we look at it, we’re a big company. The tax is volatile; you can’t predict it; and there’s other things that happen positively and negatively over time, and we don’t like to talk about them but those two did offset the tax benefit and I don’t want all the headlines to be we only made the quarter because of the tax benefit because there were some offsetting things in there. But it’s always like that.  Dave, I don’t know if you have anything else to.
Neil Currie – UBS: One of the things worth mentioning that’s good to know, the other thing I’ll ask about the tax rate is what do you expect for the fourth quarter? What’s in the guidance?
Michael Schlotman: Well, it’s—the guidance for the year is basically where we are year-to-date, slightly under 35%. It’s—again, you never know if there’s a tax contingency going to go for you or against you on a quarterly basis. It’s up to folks other than us. 
Neil Currie – UBS: Sure, but should we assume 37% for the fourth quarter?
Michael Schlotman: About 36 is what I would assume.
Neil Currie – UBS: Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.
David Dillon: Thank you, Neil, and before we end the call though today, I do have a special message for all our associates who we encourage and invite to listen in. First, I’d like to recognize Paul Scutt, Senior Vice President of Retail Operations for his leadership and contributions to Kroger. Paul recently announced his plans to retire in February after a distinguished 45-year career with our company. He’s been a driving force behind Kroger’s safety, productivity and cost control improvements through the years, and we’re grateful for his influence on our business. We wish Paul and his wife Carol all the best and we’ll miss seeing him on a daily basis. I also want to thank all our associates for delivering on our Customer First strategy once again. Each of you play a unique part in achieving the positive results we announced today. The changing economy has affected each of us in some way and it has affected some of our customers more than others. We remain committed to serving all our customers, those who continue to shop on a tight budget, those who feel more confident in their spending, and everyone in between. Thank you for your special efforts every day to give each customer a warm welcome and a fantastic shopping experience. With two months remaining in our fiscal year, we need all of your individual efforts to finish strong in the fourth quarter. No matter where you work – in our supermarkets, our manufacturing plants, our warehouses, convenience stores, jewelry stores, fuel centers, or even the offices – you help make the holidays special for our customers. So I hope each of you have a wonderful and safe holiday season with family and friends. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.  Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-06-17 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Carin Fike – IR David Dillon – Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen – President and COO Mike Schlotman – SVP and CFO
Analysts: Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup Charles Grom – JPMorgan Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse Scott Mushkin – Jefferies Robby Ohmes – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Karen Short – BMO Capital
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2010 The Kroger Company earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one topic with one question and one follow-up question if necessary. Thank you. Before I turn the call over to David Dillon, Kroger’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we want to take a moment to invite you to join us here in Cincinnati for our 2010 Investor Conference on September 28 and 29. We will be sharing more details with you soon and look forward to seeing you then. I’ll now turn the call over to Dave.
David Dillon: Thank you, Carin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger’s first quarter 2010 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I am pleased with the strong positive identical sales growth we achieved in the first quarter on striking a better balance of margin investments. Our Customer 1st strategy continues to deliver results through improvements in all four key areas we target; our people, our products, the overall shopping experience in our stores, and prices. As a result, the total number of families we serve continues to grow and our most loyal customers are buying more with us. We are also reducing debt and returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Identical supermarket sales increased 2.4% without fuel during the quarter. This continues Kroger’s trend of positive identical sales growth that is among the strongest in the industry. Each one of our 18 supermarket divisions had positive identical sales results. Let me repeat that. Every supermarket division we operate posted positive identical sales results for the quarter. I want to thank all our associates for these great results. Growth in loyal households and strong sales of our own brands and national brands continued throughout the first quarter, demonstrating the strength of Kroger’s overall competitive position and the value proposition we provide to customers. As you know, several years ago, we developed a strategy to strengthen our connection with customers. Our Customer 1st strategy focuses on four key areas, our customers have told us are important to them; our people, our products, the overall shopping experience in our stores, and our prices. All of these – all of these are important to our customers when they decide where to shop. Based on feedback from our customers, we continue to make good progress in these four key areas, as we focused our offering on offering shoppers more value for the way they live. Customers tell us they appreciate the entire spectrum Kroger’s unique value proposition offers, including friendly service, quality products that they trust, good prices, a pleasant shopping experience, and a personalized reward for their loyalty. As a result, both the total number of families and the total number of loyal households we serve continues to grow. Equally important to us, our most loyal customers are buying more with us. We are building momentum through our multi-dimensional strategy, which serves Kroger customers, associates and shareholders well in a variety of economic conditions. Several factors continued to influence Kroger’s business in the first quarter. They include aggressive competition, rising commodity costs, and the slow and inconsistent pace of the economic recovery, and consumer confidence. Kroger continues to perform well, as the economy struggles to recovery. Our loyalty card data and proprietary analysis point to mixed spending behaviors across several customer segments. Several signs indicate that customers are feeling more optimistic. They are spending more money inside our stores on certain discretionary categories such as organic foods, specialty deli needs, higher in lines. Many non-food categories also show improvement. At the same time, customers who are more price sensitive remain cautious about discretionary spending. Furthermore, the continued high use of food stamps and government programs is still causing volatility in our weekly sales trends. Our Customer 1st strategy serves all of these varying customer needs in one. Food cost also continued to affect our financial results. For the quarter, we estimate product cost inflation, excluding fuel, was roughly 90 basis points. Because this figure is an average across several different departments, some additional detail might be helpful to you. When you exclude milk, which was slightly inflationary and of course a big category for us, the grocery department experienced nearly 180 basis points of deflation. This compares to almost 270 basis points of deflation in the fourth quarter last year. We saw a very different picture in produce where we experienced over 700 basis points of cost inflation due to supply issues stemming from unfavorable weather in some growing regions. This was a trend change in 2009 when we experienced significant deflation in produce cost throughout much of the year. Our results show we are striking a better balance between delivering solid near-term financial results and investing for the future growth of Kroger’s business. We are committed to improving this balance as the year progresses and as the industry continues to normalize. To that end, we have confirmed our identical supermarket sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2010. We expect identical supermarket sales growth of 2% to 3% without fuel for the year. Net earnings are expected to range from $1.60 to $1.80 per diluted share. We are striving to achieve these results in the upper half of the earnings guidance range, and our incentive compensation plan reflects this objective. The operating environment remains uncertain, and we believe several factors will continue to influence Kroger sales and earnings performance throughout the year. These factors include inflation or deflation in product and operating costs, the competitive environment, fluctuating fuel margins, and the inconsistency of the economic recovery. Next I’ll turn it over to Rodney who will provide more detail on our performance during the first quarter. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team did a great job during the quarter to set the stage for the rest of the year. Our associates’ efforts to control expenses enabled us to maintain a compelling price position relative to both discount and traditional grocery competitors. We are particularly pleased with our associates’ continued success in strengthening Kroger’s connection with our customers. This truly is a differentiating factor for our company. As a result, the number of total households we serve continued to grow in the first quarter. Our loyal household count grew at a faster rate, including that our best customers are the primary beneficiaries of the investments we are making in the four key areas of our Customer 1st strategy. We reward our best customers for their increased loyalty. Increasing purchases from loyal families is an important part of our growth strategy. Our strong partnership with dunnhumby supports this objective by allowing us to use our shopper data to reward our best customers with offers and coupons tailored exclusively for them. No other US grocery retailer offers this level of personalization and reward. Our goal is to earn a customer’s loyalty for life. Growing market share is an important part of Kroger’s long-term strategy. We look at numerous resources to evaluate market share changes in our industry. The resources we review all show Kroger continues to gain share, which is consistent with our loyal household growth and our strong identical sales growth relative to most of our competitors. One of the most reliable and independent resources we regularly review is Nielsen’s Homescan Data. Their reporting shows that Kroger’s overall market share continued to grow in the first quarter. Our strong corporate brands also strengthen customers’ loyalty. We serve millions of loyal households. All but 5,000 of these households purchased at least one corporate brand item during the quarter. Or in other words, if you think about it, we have millions and millions of loyal households who shop everyday in our stores. Only 5,000 of these households did not purchase a corporate brand item for us. That’s less than the number of people that could sit into the Radio City Music Hall. There would still be room left over. This is an outstanding indicator of the acceptance of our own brands and Kroger’s ability to build lifetime loyalty with customers with our exclusive and preferred brands. Corporate brands represented about 26% of our first quarter grocery department sales and approximately 34% of grocery sales units. We are pleased that we have maintained share at this level because we have expected some adjustments in customers’ purchasing behavior as the economy improves. Kroger now has more than 20,000 corporate brand items. On average, approximately 11,000 of these items are available in an individual store based on store format and the specific preferences of customers who shop that store. The overwhelming acceptance of our corporate brands demonstrates customers recognize the quality and price advantage these products offer. Increasingly, we are introducing items which fulfill an unmet need. One example, and this one I’m especially proud of our team, is our line of Fresh Selections bag salads with food tracing technology. The HarvestMark technology we use on these salads allows customers to trace the origin of the salad through information listed on each bag. One other new entry includes two cereals without high fructose corn syrup. We developed these cereals based on feedback from parents who wanted cereal options that are free of high fructose corn syrup and include whole grains. Products such as these are mom-approved before they arrive on store shelf because they were created based on what moms and increasingly dads have told us they want for their families. We also continue to make strong progress on our sustainability agenda, which includes reducing energy use and our carbon footprint, reducing and recycling waste, and engaging our customers by offering them sustainable products to purchase. Our associates also support our efforts to save energy and reduce waste through their actions. In fact, our associates have helped Kroger reduce the energy we use by more than 27% in the past 10 years. This is enough energy to power every single family home in the city of Memphis, Tennessee for one year. Through another initiative, we have reduced the amount of plastic use in our Big K one and two-liter bottles. As a result, we will remove more than 275,000 pounds of plastic from the waste stream annually. Last month, we reduced another milestone in our transition to using LED lighting in refrigerated cases in our stores. Now, more than 1,700 of our nearly 2,500 stores are using LED lighting in glass door refrigerated cases. This LED lighting uses 75% less energy than traditionally fluorescent lights. Turning now to labor relations, we completed successful contract negotiations for our associates in Dallas, and we reached a tentative agreement with the union representing our associates in Michigan. Negotiations continue in several markets, including New Mexico, Houston, Portland, and Seattle. We began negotiations soon with the teamsters in Southern California and with the UFCW in Cincinnati, Fort Wayne, Little Rock, and Toledo. Rising healthcare costs and retirement plan contributions continue to be an issue. Our objective in every negotiation is to balance competitive costs with compensation packages that provide good wages, high quality affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. Now Mike will offer more detail on the first quarter and Kroger’s financial strategy. Mike?
Mike Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney. And good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Kroger reported positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of 2.4% for the first quarter. Recall from our comments in March that the timing of the Super Bowl and snowstorms in many regions we serve benefited the beginning of our first quarter identical sales trend. On the flipside, the timing of Memorial Day negatively affected our identical sales trend at the end of the quarter. Of course, our second quarter identical sales results will benefit from the timing change. Kroger’s strong identical sales growth produced solid earnings that were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Net earnings totaled $373.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to $435.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Last year’s first quarter results benefited from commodity costs, particularly dairy and diesel fuel that were unusually favorable to our business. This year, stronger profits from Kroger’s retail fuel operations helped soften this difficult comparison. Our retail fuel operations added approximately $0.04 per share to Kroger’s first quarter earnings on a year-over-year basis, as we expected. I’ll provide some additional color on our retail fuel operations in a minute. Let’s turn now to some of the details of our first quarter results. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 77 basis points. Most of this decline was driven by Kroger’s investment in supermarket selling gross margin, which declined 71 basis points, excluding fuel. This sequential improvement from the 125 basis point decline in the fourth quarter selling gross margin demonstrates we are seeing better balance between price investment and tonnage growth. Our more moderate margin investment yielded mid-single digit tonnage growth, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Kroger reported a $15.4 million LIFO charge during the quarter, a decrease of $7.7 million from the same period last year. Excluding retail fuel operations, the LIFO charge decreased 4 basis points as a rate of sales. We continue to anticipate a full year LIFO charge of $50 million for fiscal 2010. Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A increased 13 basis points from the same period last year. Healthcare, pension costs, and credit card fees continued to pressure Kroger’s OG&A rate. These rising expenses were mostly offset by identical supermarket sales leverage and the benefit from productivity improvement, process changes, and our efforts to reduce energy usage. The higher OG&A rate also reflects expenses associated with the Little Clinic and i-wireless. Kroger’s first quarter operating margin, excluding our retail fuel operations, declined 85 basis points, primarily as a result of the year-over-year changes in FIFO gross margin and OG&A expenses I described for you. The year-over-year decline is a sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009 and Kroger’s operating margin declined over 120 basis points, excluding the benefit of a lower LIFO charge. As Dave said, we are striking a better balance between delivering solid near-term financial results and investing for the future growth of Kroger’s business. We are committed to improving this balance as the year progresses and industry conditions normalize. For the 2010 full year, we continue to expect a slight decline to a slight improvement in Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin. Turning now to our retail fuel operations, both sales and earnings were strong. Fuel sales increased at both our supermarket and convenient stores due to higher average retail fuel prices and a strong increase in the number of gallons sold, both in total and on an identical gallon basis. The cents per gallon fuel margin was 11.7 cents per gallon for the quarter compared to 8.2 cents in the same period last year. On a rolling four-quarter basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was 11.6 cents in the first quarter compared with 14.3 cents in the same period last year. Our guidance for fiscal 2010 assumes a normalized margin for this business of approximately 11 cents per gallon. I’ll now update you on our long-term financial strategy. We are very focused on allocating the substantial cash flow of Kroger’s business to reward our shareholders, both today and in the future. We plan to invest approximately $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in capital projects during 2010 with a strong bias towards remodels and infrastructure projects. We are doing so because we see plenty of opportunities in this environment to expand Kroger’s competitive advantage and generate strong returns through capital investments. These investments are designed to keep our store base fresh and appealing to our customers and reducing operating costs. All of these investments are squarely focused on delivering our Customer 1st strategy and are generating returns higher than our cost of capital. We are also committed to maintaining Kroger’s strong balance sheet and solid credit rating. At the end of the first quarter, net total debt was $7.1 billion, a decrease of $339.8 million from a year ago. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Kroger’s net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio adjusted for the Southern California impairment charge in 2009 and Hurricane Ike charges in 2008 was 1.91 compared with 1.77 during the same period last year. Our objective is to manage this leverage ratio in a range that maintains our current BBB rating from three major rating agencies. While capital investments and balance sheet strength position our company well for future growth, we realize it is important to provide near-term rewards to our shareholders through a program of regular stock buybacks and quarterly dividend payments. During the quarter, we invested $79.5 million of Kroger’s free cash flow to repurchase 3.6 million shares of Kroger stock at an average price of $21.89 per share. After the quarter ended, we purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of stock at an average price of $20.25. Approximately $240 million remained under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in January of 2008. During the quarter, we returned $61 million to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. Our Board has increased the dividend each year since it was established in 2006. Kroger’s dividend yield adds 1.5% to 2.0% total shareholder return. Now I will turn it back to Dave.
David Dillon: Mike, thank you. Throughout the difficult operating environment, the Kroger team has stayed squarely focused on delivering on our Customer 1st strategy. Kroger has had the courage in this challenging economy to invest in our stores to keep them fresh, to invest in many cost-saving projects, and to invest in improving our customer shopping experience. Our customers have noticed and are rewarding us with their loyalty. We believe these investments will continue to differentiate Kroger today and will position us well for profitable growth for years to come. As we move forward throughout the year, we are focused on balancing investments in our business and returns for shareholders as we work to create long-term value. We now look forward to your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf. Please proceed.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Are you – can you break down the ID sales growth between transactions and basket size for us and give us a sense of how that’s been trended into the quarter?
David Dillon: I’ll give you the sense of the total picture. And I’m not sure, Mike, that we have to turn through the quarter. If you have something you want to add, feel free. But – for the whole quarter, the biggest gain was in customer count. When you take a customer transaction count, that was by far the biggest gain. But our average sale that’s the sales running up for each transaction also was up, but it was only up slightly. You want to add anything to the trends?
Mike Schlotman: When you look at the trends through the quarter, obviously it started out well because of the factors I talked about at the beginning of the quarter, that being the Super Bowl and the weather. If you were to just look at it in absolute terms at the end of the quarter, the last quarter – the last week of this year was up against the Memorial Day last year. So it was not a stronger comparison. So it gets a little bit murky. I think if you look at – when you look at the transactions on a monthly basis, which is most relevant I think, we continued to have, as Dave said, strong growth in the transactions as well as the number of units those households bought on a monthly basis, which is one of the ways we track it versus each time they come into the store.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And to follow up, some of your operators have begun talking about unit inflation or deflation, and sort of back of the envelope, seems pretty obvious that your item deflation from – in this quarter from last quarter was kind of a lot. And it’s not all – some of it is explained by less deflation and product costs and less investment on your part. But is the rest of it explained by consumer behavior in terms of like a dramatic shift in trading down or can you give us a little light on that?
David Dillon: I think the best thing to do is just think about inflation the way we have described it in the material we gave earlier. We saw the average as inflation at 90 basis points, so 0.9%. But that doesn’t even begin to tell the story because you have to disaggregate it to see where those pieces fell. Produce tends to run the inflationary number up a bit because it was a 7% inflation in the quarter. Our grocery, you can’t even look at by yourself because dairy was slightly inflationary, and that tends – because it’s such big category, tends to offset some of the rest of the grocery department. But even in the rest of the grocery department, which is the area that I think actually of biggest interest to your question, in that area, in the fourth quarter, our deflation was 270 basis points, and in the fourth quarter it was 180 basis points. We had described last year and still believe that gradually as you go through the rest of this year that we will see deflation turn into slight inflation, which it did in the quarter. And we think that trend will continue then through the rest of the year. But it’s going to be in different sectors in different ways. Grocery, though, is the one that I look at most closely. And I think taking milk out of it gives you a clearer view as to what’s happening. And the rate of deflation in grocery clearly has become a little less. I don’t think that’s driven more by mix change, which is the question you are asking about customer behavior, I think it’s more driven simply by the cost of the products. Rodney, you want to –?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, it was just – the only thing I would add, Andy, to that is if you look an awful lot of it, we are starting to cycle a lot of the items that were deflationary a year ago. So if you look at the produce example on the inflation, part of that inflation was created because there was so much deflation a year ago; part of it was created because of the poor quality – poor quantity – amount of produce out there. So a lot of the change is really where we are starting to cycle deflation a year ago. So it’s not so much of the change in customer behavior. Now, Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, we are seeing some areas where people are starting to spend a little more money in terms of if you look at our non-food areas, we are having some growth there; organic food and some of those things. But it’s really – most of it is driven by cycling deflation a year ago.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: And just lastly in the same vein, what can you tell us about the ability of the market to absorb increases at retail as protein has really shown some inflation lately and dairy as well? Are these being passed through? Dave, you certainly use the term normal, which I’m glad to hear. Are you seeing signs that there is some normal ability of the markets passed are inflating product costs?
David Dillon: On the whole, the answer to that question in my view is yes. There is always – when it comes to this question, there is always qualifiers, because it depends on the competitive environment, it depends on the particular items. And when you look, for instance, at produce, when you have high inflation in produce, you clearly have a mix change by customers within produce. Same thing in meat. When you have some inflation or deflation, it tends to drive a different consumer behavior within that department. That's not quite as true in grocery except perhaps in milk. In milk, you do see – tend to see a little gallon each change, not maybe as much as inflation or deflation, but you see some gallon each change as that changes. But in the whole of grocery – in the bulk of grocery, excluding dairy, general speaking, as costs go up, the retail goes up and follow suit. And so I’d say it is the normal – we would see the current environment as more normal in that sense and we do expect that cost increases will be passed through. In some cases, that may hurt volume of a national brand vendor who raises prices, but they take that into account when they make the decisions whether they are going to raise the cost. But that’s certainly our objective.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Good morning, everyone.
David Dillon: Hi, Chuck, good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: When you look at your capital spending of about $2 billion this year, can you give us some ideas on what you are looking to expand square footage and maybe break down how that will be driven between new stores, remodels that go outside the four walls as well as replacements? And are you keeping some powder dry to go after some end market acquisitions, because I haven’t heard much about that lately? And then can you give us some examples on what you are doing in terms of infrastructure spending to make you more competitive or perhaps projects that are completed and you are willing to talk about?
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Chuck. I’ll handle the questions on the square footage and the like. And I’ll let Rodney talk about the infrastructure projects. If you look at our current forecast, we would expect somewhere between 40 and 50 net new relocated and expanded stores, somewhere between 150 to 175 within-the-wall remodels of a major variety. These things are always fluctuating. And that would give us square footage growth. If you exclude operational closings and any acquisitions of about 1.5% or so, we’d be where we are today. Relative to keeping powder dry, our $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion would exclude any dollars we would spend to buy a property that’s currently leased, because as you know, over the last 18 months or so, we’ve been fairly successful of doing that at pretty attractive cap rates. It would also exclude any dollars we would spend on an acquisition. We would review those acquisitions independent of our normal capital program and look at the return they would generate and the EBITDA they would add relative to the spend.
Rodney McMullen: Chuck, remember, one of the reasons why we do that on acquisitions is we don’t want to build a business plan around where we have to have acquisitions, deliver what we’ve committed to from a return standpoint, because we think that causes companies to chase acquisitions rather than only doing acquisitions when it makes sense. And that’s the reason why we do what Mike just said. In terms of an infrastructure project, the biggest buckets would be things that we’ve invested in to improve the shopping experience for the customer, technology, warehouse and energy. And if you think about the LED lighting that I talked about as an example, that would be something where we allocated capital to support an energy project that has a good return, and it’s also good for sustainability. There are several things that we would have done on shopping experience, things like that. Technology, it’s really trying to figure out ways to make things easier for our associates, both in our stores, warehouses and plants, to do their daily job. I can’t think of any that specifically I can talk about other than if you think about there would be some capital involved to support some of the things we’ve done with dunnhumby, for example. Probably it would be something that would be reasonably easy to see. And then – go ahead.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Right. I don’t mean to imply that you would add acquisition spending buried somewhere in your CapEx budget, but I’m just wondering if there is this pause [ph] in it that suggests that there might be some opportunities breaking loose all of a sudden, say, in the remainder of the fiscal year.
David Dillon: We don’t see our capital budget as being a barrier to those kind of acquisitions. Those rise and fall purely on their individual merit.
Rodney McMullen: Acquisitions so far wouldn’t be much different than what we’ve seen in the past. We see quite a bit of things, but the pricing that people expect is still more than what you can really justify and get a good return on the investment.
Mike Schlotman: Chuck, you referenced pass, I think, in your follow-up question there. We don’t really – we view our current capital program as standing in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year, which is where we were last year, and we would expect to be in the next two or three – in the next couple of years after this year. Remember, back in March we talked about – at one point in time, that would have been about $1 billion higher over those three years. We just felt in this environment, given what we are trying to do with our balance sheet and maintaining our rating, it was more targeted towards that, somewhat influenced by our results last year and a desire to make sure that we didn’t put too much pressure on our organization to maintain the credit ratings where we wanted them, given that our results last year weren’t where we wanted them.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: All right. Thank you and good luck for the remainder of the year.
David Dillon: Thanks, Chuck.
Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Chuck.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Good morning. So two questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit more – I think, Dave, you referred to aggressive competition. Are you seeing that across all geographies? And maybe if you can elaborate if that’s also across the store?
David Dillon: Okay. You are a little hard to hear, Deborah. So there is more to your question in a minute. Talk a little louder –
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Okay. I can –
David Dillon: I got the first part. The first part was on – what did we mean by aggressive competition? And I think what we are seeing while there has been a lot of marketing noise written about what’s happening in the industry, it is very much like what we saw last quarter where it varies widely by market and by competitors. And it’s based on the interaction earlier, competitive behavior in each particular market. So we think it’s strong competition. It has kept some focused on selected prices. For instance, there are some hot deals out there right now; soft drinks and milk as a couple of examples of categories. But those are – and those are competitively driven. But on the whole, I’d say the environment is pretty much like what it was last quarter. Rodney, do you want to add anything to that?
Rodney McMullen: No.
David Dillon: Okay. Did you have another part, Deborah?
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Yes. And then just in terms of – separate question. In terms of general merchandise performance, maybe you can even focus on Fred Meyer and the multi-department stores, is that kind of – if you maybe just discuss the general merchandise performance and even jewelry?
David Dillon: I’ll let Rodney to give any description he may want on both jewelry and on Fred Meyer. But I would like to add just maybe this overall comment on general merchandise. In the past, you will note that maybe a year ago or so, we talked about general merchandise as an indication of customers spending less in discretionary categories. And that was one of the categories. So we feel pretty good about this quarter seeing identical sales and general merchandise being positive. And that’s when we – in the past, it’s often combined HBC and – or the drug and GM categories together. But when we split up GM, it actually was positive in the quarter. So Rodney, you want to add anymore?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, I’d just add a couple comments. One, I’m just delighted with our Fred Meyer team and our jewelry team both. If you look at the performance in general merchandise, it’s very broad-based in a lot of categories, which is very exciting. The other thing I find increasingly exciting is the Fred Meyer team is doing a better and better job of working across the whole company on general merchandise to help us sell more general merchandising all Kroger stores, not just the Fred Meyer. And then on jewelry, if you look at the identicals there, the identical there – if you look at the peer groups, they would be the best of any company that’s reported from an identical standpoint. How much of that is driven by the economy and how much of that driven by some of the changes we’ve done, and how much of that is driven because so many competitors have gone out of business, I think would be hard to speculate. But overall, on both fronts, it’s nice to see the continued improvement versus where we were in the fourth quarter.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: So, Rodney, is Fred Meyer team helping bring in more season to Kroger or it is improving the overall quality of the SKUs that are in Kroger?
Rodney McMullen: Both. And that’s the area where we’re really focused on working together to try to identify those items that customers would really find helpful and a good value for their money. And that’s really both.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: That’s great. All right. Well, thanks so much and best of luck, guys.
David Dillon: Thanks, Deborah.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Charles Grom – JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on OG&A up 13 basis points on the corn, I think you said healthcare, pension and credit card, just wondering – CostCo has talked about their healthcare costs starting to come down a little bit. I’m just wondering if you could give us a little bit of sense of what you think that OG&A line on the core will look like over the next couple of quarters.
David Dillon: I’ll let Mike in a second comment about the forward thinking on OG&A. But you identified them correctly, but add to that the way OG&A is calculated for us. It also includes – the other element we included was expenses in our wireless and the Little Clinic, both of which are affected in a negative way too. And we felt that a lot of those costs were offset in part at least by productivity improvements, process change, and what we’ve done in energy. So we actually felt it was pretty good. Healthcare, though, is problematic. It was at least in the quarter. And it was more problematic in our company plan than in the plans covered by the Taft-Hartley funds, and that’s mostly because they are structured differently. In one case, the union plans really – we pay them based upon either hours worked or some other formula. In the company plan, it is self-insured. We basically pay their claims as they happen. But it is true. We experienced higher healthcare cost in the first quarter. Do you want to comment going forward on OG&A?
Mike Schlotman: I won’t give exquisite specific guidance on OG&A, but clearly our goal is to drive down our operating cost on an annual basis. So our components of our incentive plan were without a reduction in operating cost. And that would be OG&A plus rent and depreciation, as well as the expenses in gross profit. If we don’t manage those expenses well on an annual basis, it limits the amount of our potential bonus payout. So we’re incentified [ph] to do that. I think Dave’s point is the key point. If you look at the operations of the company, yes, pension, healthcare and credit card expenses caused some headwinds at the operating level. But the productivity improvement, the process changes, and the energy savings essentially offset those. So they performed very well. But OG&A line in total did have the expenses from i-wireless and TLC in it, and this is the first quarter we owned all of the Little Clinic versus just a portion of the Little Clinic, which is one of the reasons that would have affected it for the first time like it did.
Charles Grom – JPMorgan: Okay. Could you quantify the i-wireless and the (inaudible)?
Mike Schlotman: I wouldn’t get specific on it. It would be – it would be a good chunk of the 13, but it’s not like it’s 90% of it, but it’s a good chunk of the 13. It’s the only reason we called those two out. There really wasn’t anything else out there that was remarkable enough to quantify.
Charles Grom – JPMorgan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the core question on the competitive market and just wondering if we could kind of dig into the – obviously a 900 (inaudible) with Wal-Mart, and since they started their rollback campaign on April 1st and then they started to do their deepest counts on May 1st, just wondering in markets where you specifically overlapped with a Wal-Mart supercenter, have you seen any discernable trend since they began that rollback activity?
David Dillon: Let me talk just generally about Wal-Mart and how we see our markets just for a moment. We don’t often talk about individual competitors, but many of you have asked about them and so it’s probably worth commenting. Wal-Mart affects any of the marketplaces in which they operate, like any other competitors affects those marketplaces. Wal-Mart has become publicly more aggressive as what they are saying that they are doing. And if you look at what’s happening in the stores and in the markets, just like we said the last two quarters, I think probably in each of the last two quarters, the marketing behavior, merchandising behavior of Wal-Mart is a lot more consistent with a traditional grocery supermarket operation than it is consistent with what Wal-Mart used to do. It’s a lot more future items. Sometimes a future is a little longer than a week, but it’s future items. And when you operate that way, there are items that come down in price, which get lots of publicity. But there are also items that go up in price, that don’t get much publicity. And so we see the behavior as there is a lot of marketing noise around, but we see the behavior as pretty much what happens in a lot of grocery markets that we’ve been involved in for our entire history. As a result, the most important thing I think for you to think about is that our behavior in those markets and in every market is based upon our plan and what we believe to be consistent with our Customer 1st strategy and what we think our customers want. We can’t do that with a blind eye to what competition does, but we also can’t let competition dictate to us what we’re going to do in those markets, and we’ve chosen not to. And so we are approaching this from – clearly from the point of view of what do we think our customers got from us in this kind of environment and we’re using our data and insight in order to drive that. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, I’d just add a couple of other things. It’s one of the reasons why in Dave’s call – in his prepared remarks he talked about we had positive identical sales in all divisions, to try to give everybody a perspective of our broad base on our strength of our identical sales. The other thing that I would add to that is from our perspective, Wal-Mart really started getting more promotional on specific items, really Thanksgiving last year, when they started running turkeys at $0.40 and some of those things. So they branded it a little differently this year than they branded it last year, but they really did start looking more like a traditional supermarket in the way they go to market late last year by getting aggressive on pricing on a few items from a promotional standpoint.
Charles Grom – JPMorgan: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just last question will be on the 2.4%. It sounds like there is a little bit of a Memorial Day shift, and just wondering if you’ve got a chance to go back and quantify that. And then I guess since the Memorial Day period, another sort of a flip-flop in the calendar, just wondering how your June sales are looking so far.
David Dillon: Let me address the latter question, and if Mike wants to say anything on Memorial Day, specifically he can, but we’ve only had three weeks in the quarter so far – 3.5 weeks in the quarter so far. And if you adjust for the fact that Memorial Day is in this quarter now, if you adjust that out, it looks to us that the trend in those three weeks is about the same, consistent with what we had achieved in the first quarter. So that gives you a sense of where we are at this point. Mike, you want to add anything on Memorial Day?
Mike Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn’t make any adjustment to the first quarter as we saw in the Memorial Day because it really helped to offset the strong start we had right at the beginning of the Super Bowl and the weather. So if you look at the quarter by itself, it negotiated it somewhat. And as Dave said, excluding Memorial Day so far this quarter, we’re right in line with where we were in the first quarter alone.
Charles Grom – JPMorgan: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning, guys. And nice quarter again.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: You’ve mentioned that you incentivize basically to improve expenses either in the gross margin or the OG&A line. Can you talk a little bit now about how you’ve tracked against those goals so far in the first quarter? Does that ramp throughout the year and maybe provide some color on the key initiatives that you have in this area?
Rodney McMullen: Do you want to comment about – I mean, so far this year, I would say we’re not where we need to be to have that limit come off of the bonus plans or with limit our ability to achieve certain payout metrics under our bonus plan. It is early in the year. And we clearly have plans in place to achieve those because we will be mutually rewarded if that occurs. As far as specific items that we have in place, some of those we’ve talked about and I don’t think we will get any more specific on progress and productivity improvements, but we continue to see the opportunity and implement different energy saving projects, for example, to continue to drive those costs down. Rodney talked about the investments we are making and infrastructure, both form a technology and a warehousing standpoint that we were expected to pay rewards as time goes on as well.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And another question for you on your fuel centers. You’ve been added each quarter literally somewhere between 15 and 20 fuel centers. It’s clearly a strong driver of growth in your gallons sold. My guess though, it’s also an important part of – maybe not important part of the comp, but it does help the comp for the source where you add the fuel centers. Is that a fair assessment? I mean, what happens to those supercenters when you add – there is food source when you add a fuel center? And then also what’s the runway left for adding fuel centers? There is still a fair amount to do.
David Dillon: We’ve – you've assessed it pretty well, as we see gas. Our customers really like fuel in our stores. So when we add fuel, that becomes an additional convenience. And there is just no reason for people to stop with us. As a result, we continue to add them. Our identical gallonage [ph] growth, which would be just the place as they had fuel in both years, continues to grow in addition to growing as a result of new additional gas stations. We do continue to see opportunities to add. We are going to add 100 or so this year. I don’t know that we’ve given a specific (inaudible) certainly in that ballpark. And that’s consistent with what we’ve done in the last couple of years. We are bullish on it. I think it’s a good deal for our customers. They seem to like that added convenience. So it’s a benefit.
Rodney McMullen: It’s an area where convenience stores really helped us accelerate what we can do in the supermarkets. And it’s really their knowledge is helping us, and they really help us run across the company.
Mike Schlotman: It also helps with sales within the box, so that’s driving traffic to the stories, is that fair?
David Dillon: Well, it helps a little bit with the traffic in that sense. So yes, there are some benefits there.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: And then just last question for you real quick, on the share repurchase side, it looks like you ramp things up a little bit, opportunistically post the end of the quarter. How do we think about share repurchases for the rest of this year, assuming that your business trends do continue to improve? And like you said, if you’re hopeful to get towards the higher end of the range, is there any opportunity to get more aggressive there.
David Dillon: I want to make sure you understand that the purchases since the end of the quarter, they weren’t opportunistic as you describe them. We would have been in a blackout period and precluded from operating opportunistically in that timeframe. As we go throughout the period of time where we’re already going to a blackout period, we’ve put a 10b5-1 plan in place that would obviously – well, maybe not obviously, but intellectually would be designed to book, buy more when the stock is low and less than the stock is high. And we also put a dollar limit on that plan so the things don’t get too out of hand from spending cash at deployment time where we really can’t moderate our plan. So while it appears it was opportunistic, it was an independent decisions made every day, which is merely the design of the grid caused us to be in the market. The prices – the stock was on a more regular basis. You had mentioned something about the upper end of the range. Keep in mind, we are talking about the tough half of the range, not necessarily the upper end of the range. I think we view our stock. As we sit here today as attractive. And we’d expect that when our blackout period is lifted, we would then implement a new 10b5-1 plan to continue to be in the market on a regular basis.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Great, thank you.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: Hey, guys, thanks. I wanted to go back. I know you commented a little bit on Wal-Mart’s activity. And I wanted to explore the idea that maybe Wal-Mart since April, because our data which show that has been more aggressive versus where they were last November. They certainly would think they are. They also made comments that they are having a hard time passing on some of the inflation, which I think, Dave, you mentioned that you are not seeing as hard. I mean, do you think instead of Wal-Mart not doing anything, maybe demonstrating this more loyalty in the customer – in the Kroger customer base. And how do you play that up and play it out? I think you went through some data about loyal households. Maybe you want to talk to that a little bit if that’s okay.
David Dillon: Sure. First of all, I do think Wal-Mart has made some changes, of course, now from November 1st. But it’s a similar kind of a – course of activity. So I wouldn’t suggest otherwise. And they have certainly been very visible in public about that in papers, and all of you have written quite a little bit about it. But the most important part to think about here, I think, is what that mean to Kroger for us. And we do think that one of the reasons we don’t get as affected by some of our competitors, including Wal-Mart, but others too, is because we are focused on building loyalty for over a period of time. So there are lots of things that cause a customer to shop with us. Last week, I did a couple of shop-alongs. And that’s a case where you go with an individual customer, you meet him and talk through a little, how they shop and then you go see how they shop in the store. And we do a variety of those. Rodney has done some recently, and as we do those, we get a sense of the complexity of how customers behave. It’s not generally because of one item or one price. It’s generally because of the overall combination of things put together in a store. In our case, we think looking at what we call our four keys is essential. It cannot be just about price. If it’s just about price, that really is Wal-Mart’s game and not our game. And so we don’t focus just on that. And that’s one of the reasons even our capital is exiting some other areas too this year, not just about price. So overall, I’d say we are playing our game, we are on our court, we think it’s working well for us. We’d see – we've even identified that even in the fourth quarter, we see our market share has improved. We also identified in the first three weeks of this quarter that our sales continues similar to what they were in the first quarter, all of which should describe to you that since the time period you are saying that we don’t – we are not seeing a particularly large impact or some big sea change of events.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: So Dave, on the same lines, some of the (inaudible) had a call this morning, called Wal-Mart’s activity very disruptive. And the idea here that maybe you honestly benefit that as the promotion that the people that aren’t involved in the promotions that are going on as your biggest competitors, maybe willing to help you out a little bit. I mean, have you seen a step-up in health from the channel, now that Wal-Mart is doing what they are doing?
David Dillon: Well, I think we saw not for their reason, but I think we saw as we have described before that many of the national brand vendors wanted to get their tonnage moving again, have been out in the market generally with more promotional dollars. And even when they may raise their list prices, they often don’t have money out there to promote the products. And we’ve already indicated we had a very solid quarter on national grand tonnage. Very pleased in those results. And the vendors who have worked with us on partnerships. Common deal was joint projects to produce better sales have shown really good results. So anybody who has partnered with this, I think we’d go away saying, “Hey, that’s worked really well, and I want to be more.” But I wouldn’t say it’s just about us or just about Wal-Mart is really what are they doing to try to drive their sales, and it’s not – I don’t think it’s focused right here at describing.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: So then my final question, thanks for taking them, is I just want to make sure I understood what you were saying about the consumers is all mix signs, vis-à-vis had a sequentially last quarter. Do we think things have slowed down with the consumer improving, or is it just – because I know food stamps were taken off a little bit again? I mean, where do you think the consumer is? Are we at a plateau or are things still slowly improving? I’m just trying to gauge what you said.
David Dillon: Well, actually what we were describing is that we look at customer segments. And that there is gurgling going on in some of the segments that would tend to confuse a person because the customers in those segments are a little confused themselves. So we’ve pointed out some things on the positive side. So for example, we talked about some of the higher end lines being better. (inaudible) meat has improved for us. We did not identify, but it’s true. SarbOx has improved for us. We identified I think organics, natural foods have improved; floral has improved; general merchandise sales I talked about a little bit before. All of those are signs that people are spending some discretionary money. And – but it is by segment where that happens. We are also seeing though, on the other side, a lot of week-to-week swings, much of which was driven by food stamps and other situations where people have money one week and not have money the next. And within the segments, we are seeing them – the people we interview on those segments describing the world a little different. So the consumer confidence in some of the upscale customers is stronger than the consumer confidence in some of the people who are more price sensitive. And that affects their behavior. And so I think it’s – you almost have to look segment-by-segment and see what’s happening. And we certainly do that, and we even design our marketing plans around the different segments.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: So do you think sequentially it’s improving or not really?
David Dillon: Scott, thanks for your questions. We want to move on, so we can get to more folks and have their questions asked.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Robby Ohmes – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up actually on Scott’s question. I think you guys are now coming up upon the time last year where your tonnage really picked up. And just curious, sort of related to where Scott was going on the vendor support outlook, are you planning – or how are you thinking about those comparisons in terms of maintaining the comp trend through the next couple of quarters? Do you expect the tonnage trend that you put up the sort of mid-single digit tonnage gains you’ve put up in this quarter you just reported to sort of continue or will the way you get to your (inaudible), the way you are planning, should that shift a little bit? Thanks.
David Dillon: I think we’ve talked generally that in our minds that tonnage for the year would be a little less of a growth than what we experienced last year. That’s only natural, and you can see it in certain areas. Take produce as an example. The inflation we are experiencing in produce, we would expect and have seen, it only shifts a little as customers change what they buy. Same thing in milk. As the cost of milk and the retailer milk goes up and where it does go up, we see the gallonage decline a little bit. Our hope is though and our expectation is, is to keep tonnage in the positive range. And in order to get our identical sales to come out where we targeted for this year, we actually need to have some growth in tonnage. But no, we do not expect it to be as robust as we experienced last year.
Robby Ohmes – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: So you are baking in ticket and/or inflation improvement as you move sequentially through the rest of this year?
David Dillon: Well, we said all along that we expect the deflation we experienced last year to gradually turn into a modest inflation. And so that was baked into what we have said on the subject, yes.
Rodney McMullen: And we would expect tonnage growth more traditionally what we would have had two or three years before last year. We thought last year was an unusually high tonnage growth and not what we would typically have. And we would expect tonnage growth to get more what we had had in the past.
Robby Ohmes – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: And just very quick follow-up. The vendors, I would assume, recognize the tonnage comparisons. You guys are up against this. There are a little extra just related to that that you guys are seeing over the next few quarters. A little extra help?
Rodney McMullen: Well, like I said, the vendors see the tonnage growth that they get when they partner with us on various promotions and even longer-term programs and they like what they see.
Robby Ohmes – Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Great. Hey, thanks a lot, guys.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital. Please proceed.
Karen Short – BMO Capital: Hey, congratulations on the quarter.
Rodney McMullen: Thank you.
David Dillon: Thanks, Karen.
Karen Short – BMO Capital: Just wondering – not to continue to belabor this, but – you did a better job of balancing margins obviously this quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you did differently in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter because you obviously seem to get the same tonnage growth on being less promotional? So I wonder if I could dig into that. And I just have one quick follow-up.
David Dillon: Well, let me describe – if I go back to the third quarter, what we said on that call was that we had began a process to try to balance this out a little bit better. But that we believed changes that we needed to make needed to be gradual and gentle so that they did not disrupt what the customers saw of our programs. In the fourth quarter, you may not have felt you saw it, but it was actually a present event in the fourth quarter where we had begun to make some changes and it influenced the results, but they were gradual. Those changes began to take a little better hold in the first quarter and you see the results of those. We do think it’s important for the programs that we develop, particularly price programs, that we not pull the customer one way or the other abruptly, because it gives them the wrong impression about what we are trying to represent. And so you will see, I think, gradual trend changes on what we try to do in this area, either direction based on how we see the market and the situation at the time. And I think that’s what you saw rather than some big difference between the first quarter and the fourth quarter. First quarter had the full quarter, having some changes in it, and the fourth quarter did not have a full quarter with some of those changes in place. But it was not a fundamental change in our plans. It was not a fundamental change in our strategy. It was not a fundamental change in the targeted areas we have in place. So I –
Rodney McMullen: And it’s continuing using our dunnhumby data and other data sources to understand what promotions are working and what things don’t work and adjust for those as we go along, also so it’s using [ph] the insights that we have.
David Dillon: And trying to be more effective and how we spend our money.
Karen Short – BMO Capital: Okay. Great. And then just for Mike, it’s totally switching gears. Looking at your cash flow, inventories and expenses and trade accounts payable, they were all pretty cash flow generative. Just wondering if you could comment on was there a timing issue or what was the cause.
Mike Schlotman: Not really a timing issue. If you look at the way we look at working capital, our net operating working capital improved by about $25 million this year versus last year. When we look at that, we kind of throw out the taxes on those and short-term debt and the things that really don’t – you really can’t have any influence over. But we’ve clearly – we are focused on trying to reduce our investment in net operating working capital. And it was nice to see that we actually generated $25 million of net cash on the way we measure that. And off line, I’d be happy to give you the definition. You know us. We can’t use a traditional definition. We have to come up with our own. But it’s actually a definition that our divisions feel as though they can manage day-in day-out, because if you put – if you put deferred taxes in there, they can’t do anything about that. So we try to look at it from the standpoint of something they can manage day-in day-out.
Karen Short – BMO Capital: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
David Dillon: Karen, thank you. And before we end the call today though, I‘d like to share just a few additional thoughts with our associates who we encourage to call in. First, I want to thank you for getting us off to a solid start for the fiscal year. Our performance is a result of your individual efforts, and we really appreciate all you do. And as you know, safety is one of Kroger’s core values. We continue to strive to achieve our goal of zero accidents in our stores, plants, distribution centers and offices. Over the past 14 years, we have reduced our accident rate by more than 70%. There are several great teams to celebrate for their outstanding safety record, and each – for example, each of the following plants received – recently received an award, which indicated they achieved more than a year without an OSHA reportable injury. These six plants are America’s Beverage Company in Irvine, Texas; Pace Dairy in Crawfordsville, Indiana; Riverside Creamery in Riverside, California; Tamarack Farms Dairy in Newark, Ohio; Vandervoort Dairy in Fort Worth, Texas; and Westover Dairy in Lynchburg, Virginia. We also had many stores that have achieved outstanding safety records. 185 stores – 185 stores have gone a year without an OSHA reportable injury. Several other stores have gone at least three years without an associate injury. The top six stores that have gone without – gone full three years without an accident are Central Divisions, Number 462 in White Hall, Illinois; QFC Store, 804 in Seattle, Washington; Mid-South, Number 906 in Whitley City, Kentucky; Delta, Number 391 in Paris, Tennessee; Mid-Atlantic Division, Number 300 in Lynchburg, Virginia; and Smith’s Store, Number 131 in Ogden, Utah. That is exceptional. Congratulations to the associates in all areas of the company for keeping your focus on safety, both at home and increasingly – at work and increasingly at home too. We really appreciate your efforts. Have a great summer everyone. This completes the call today. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference call. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-03-09 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Carin Fike – IR David Dillon – Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen – President and COO Mike Schlotman – SVP and CFO
Analysts: Scott Mushkin – Jefferies & Company Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2009 The Kroger Company earnings conference call. My name is Jasmine and I’ll be operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) It is my pleasure to introduce your host for today, Ms. Carin Fike. You may proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one topic with one question, and one follow-up question if necessary. Thank you for your cooperation. I will now turn the call over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
Dave Dillon: Thank you, Carin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger’s fourth quarter and full 2009 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Kroger team delivered solid quarterly and full year results for both our customers and shareholders during what continues to be a difficult operating environment. We are strengthening Kroger’s overall competitive position by increasing the number of households that are loyal to Kroger, and earning a great share of their business. As a result, we continue to generate tonnage growth in both perishable and non-perishable categories, that is among the strongest in the industry. Identical supermarket sales increased 1.2% in the fourth quarter without fuel. For the year identical supermarkets sales without fuel increased 2.1% over 2008. Sustainable, identical sales and earnings growth remains one of Kroger’s key long-term objectives. We continue to widen the gap between Kroger’s identical sales growth trends and those of most of our competitors. We believe this has extremely positive implications for our associates, customers and shareholders, both now and as we grow our business. As we described to you last quarter, several factors continued to influence Kroger’s business in the fourth quarter. They include deflation and the slow pace of the economic recovery, which continues to restrain consumer spending. In the fourth quarter, we estimated our product cost deflation excluding fuel was nearly 100 basis points, a further drop from the 80 basis points of deflation we experienced in the third quarter. This compares to product cost inflation, excluding fuel of approximately 590 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2008, to another words the year-over-year swing of almost 700 basis points. The swing is even more staggering when you isolate the grocery department. In 2008, we experienced nearly 800 basis points of inflation in Kroger’s product cost for the grocery department during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2009, on the same internal measurement we experienced approximately 285 basis points of deflation. I’ll do the math quickly for you, that’s a swing of over 1,000 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This is unprecedented in, at least in my time in the grocery industry. The economic recovery continues to sluggish and unemployment levels remain high, suppressing consumer spending. The slow pace of the recovery will continue to influence our consumer's feel about their own spending decisions. Against this backdrop, our team performed well in a number of areas, and we believe our financial results well good and relative basis don’t fully reflect the progress Kroger is making. We made significant strides in 2009. These include positive trends and feedback from our customers, the strong rise in the number of loyal households we serve, continued growth in tonnage and market share gains. We also made meaningful progress in our sustainability efforts, which Rodney will share with you. We are proud of what our associates accomplished throughout the year and we look forward to building on this momentum. Rodney and Mike will update you on Kroger's performance in these important areas and we will start with Rodney. Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. As you know, a fundamental part of our strategy is listening to what our customers tell us is important to them and acting on that information. Every quarter we track what our customers are saying about us in four key areas; our people, our prices, our product and services, and the overall shopping experience in our stores. We measure our progress in specific categories, such as the friendliness and attentiveness of our store associates, for example. In 2009, our customers told us we improved more in each of the four key areas than in any year since we begin these customer surveys in 2004. We saw good balance of the improvement across all four keys. These surveys which track feedback from more than 50,000 customers each quarter provide meaningful insight that we can act on immediately and we will continue to seek feedback from our customers and incorporate what they tell us into our future business plans. We believe it also demonstrates the sustainability of the strong sales and tonnage growth we are producing. We conduct similar surveys of our associates and continue to make improvements based on what our associates tell us is important to them. Associate engagement is an important part of our customer first strategy. During the quarter, the total number of households we served increased over the prior year. We saw an even stronger growth in the mid-single digits in a number of loyal households that shop our family of stores. These households represent our very best customers. Our data shows these customers are making more trips into our stores and over the course of month these households are spending more total -- buying more total items from Kroger then they did a year ago. This is another indication that our strategy is resonating with our best customers. Our robust field discount programs are one example of how Kroger is able to build customer loyalty by developing unique offers that reward customers for shopping in our stores. In 2009, Kroger customers saved over 200 million through fuel discount programs tied to our loyalty cards. And we continue to expand our fuel discount programs for our most loyal customers. We recently introduced a partnership with Shell in select markets. This industry leading program gives customers more opportunities to save on gas at Kroger fuel centers and participating Shell locations. As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong overall tonnage growth that was driven by both corporate brand and national brand sales. In the fourth quarter, we saw mid single-digit growth in sales of our own brands and national brands. This is on top of the double-digit growth we saw in our own brands during the same period last year. During the fourth quarter, corporate brands represented about 27% of our grocery department sales dollars and approximately 35% of our grocery sales units. Both of these are consistent with the trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008. So, while we are seeing good growth in national grand tonnage, the popularity of our industry leading corporate brands has not diminished with customers. We believe this is the another indicator of the health of our business. Kroger’s strong tonnage growth is a direct result of several different customer focused efforts. The customer insight we drive through our unique partnership with Dunnhumby, USA enables our associates to strengthen Kroger’s connection with our customers. A strong tonnage growth is also a direct result of our associates providing service in a broad high-quality product assortment we offer at good prices. Turning now to our retail fuel operations. We continue to see strong gallon growth, both in total and on an identical basis for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Other retailers are reporting gallon declines, and the overall market indicates that the US consumers are buying fewer gallons of gasoline, but they are obviously buying more gasoline at Kroger's supermarket fuel centers and convenient stores. While margin in our retail fuel business has significant impact on Kroger's annual earnings per share results, they did not materially impact the year-over-year change in EPS for the fourth quarter. This was largely due to cents per gallon margins that were fairly consistent with last year. $0.094 per gallon for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $0.097 for the fourth quarter of 2008. On a rolling four quarter basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.106 in 2009 compared to $0.147 in 2008. Our guidance for fiscal 2010 assumes a normalized margin for this business of approximately $0.11 per gallon. One area that we have not talked a lot about but are very proud of what our associates have accomplished is our sustainability efforts. Kroger continues to make considerable progress in our top sustainability focus areas. These are waste reduction, plastic bag reduction, energy conservation and transportation. In partnership with our customers, we have increased the amount of plastic we recycled from 9 million pounds of plastic in 2007 to 22 million pounds in 2009. We saved nearly 200 million plastic bags last year, about 20% of the way to our goal of saving 1 billion plastic bags. Our approach includes engaging our associates in more efficient bagging techniques and engaging customers in using reusable bags. Our energy teams have helped us achieve impressive utility cost reductions through technologies, such as LED lighting and energy efficient motors and our freezer cases. And our fleet efficiency improved by more than 7% in 2009, meaning our logistics team delivered more cases of products per each gallon of fuel used. During the quarter, we continued to make progress in labor relations. We completed successful contract negotiations for our associates in several markets including Fry's in Arizona, King Soopers and City Market in Colorado, Fred Meyer in Oregon and Kroger in Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia. In 2010, we will negotiate agreements with the UFCW for associates in Albuquerque, Cincinnati, Dallas and Detroit, Fort Wayne, Houston, Little Rock, Portland, Seattle and Toledo. We will also negotiate agreements with the Teamsters for associates in California and Portland. Rising healthcare cost continue to be an important issue in our labor discussions. Entering contributions and expense will continue to be an issue as well. During 2009, we contributed approximately 233 million to several different and multi-employer pension funds. In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately 250 million to these funds. We continue to work diligently and cooperatively with other employers, union groups and legislators to address the underfunded status of many of these plans. While we have made progress through these efforts and plan asset values have risen along with the market recovery we continue to believe this is a serious issue for all participants. The ultimate solution will be a combination of benefit reductions, legislative changes and the increased employer contributions. Last year at this time, we thought our annual multi-employer pension contributions had the potential to double in the next few years. Based on current market conditions, we believe the potential for that scenario to develop over the next five years to be less likely. We still anticipate meaningful increases in expense each year as a consequence of the increased contributions that Kroger and other participating employers will be required to make in order to rehabilitate the funding status of many of these plans. Now, Mike will offer you more details on the fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. Mike?
Mike Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. As we described for you last quarter, from an operational perspective our fourth quarter was very similar to what we experienced during the third quarter. From an earnings perspective, a lower LIFO charge and tax rate each worth about a penny compared to our expectations caused Kroger’s earnings to be higher than the forecast we shared with you in December. Kroger’s net earnings for the year adjusted for the asset impairment charges in the third quarter were $1.71 per diluted share. These results represent a decline of 10.5% compared to fiscal 2008 earnings per diluted share of $1.91 excluding Hurricane Ike charges. As we review our financial results, keep in mind that the lower LIFO charge this year was offset by the lower fuel margin. We are very pleased with our cost controls. Our positive identical sales and cost saving efforts allowed us to leverage our OG&A. Excluding fuel and one-time items, our OG&A rate declined 3 basis points. This was an outstanding result in a period of deflated retail price points, mid-single digit tonnage growth and increasing credit card fees. Our sustainability efforts Rodney described earlier also contributed to this result. We also had good results with some of the expenses that are accounted for in the gross profit line. For example, our warehouses handled significantly more tonnage with essentially the same warehouse cost as last year. We are committed to process and productivity improvements to continue this result. Another topic of interest to investors is market share. Growing market share is an important part of Kroger’s long term strategy. Nielsen Home scan data shows that Kroger’s overall share rose approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2009. This data also indicates that our share increased in 13 of the 17 marketing areas outlined by the Nielson report, declined in three and remained unchanged in one. Wal-Mart is a primary competitor in 12 of these marketing areas. In those 12 marketing areas Kroger’s overall market share grew approximately a 100 basis points. Our share increased in the 11 of those markets and declined in one. According to our internal tracking of competitive store openings Kroger divisions compete with about 1190 Wal-Mart supercenters, an increase of roughly 60 new supercenters over last year. The reason we cited Nielsen's Homescan data is because we learned the government data used as part of our internal methodology has not been updated to reflect the impact of significant deflation and restrain consumer spending have on sales in 2009. Using the government data as it currently exists shows Kroger’s overall market share decline in 2009. We do not believe that that accurately reflects our market share results for 2009, particularly considering our strong tonnage growth and positive identical food store sales. Adjusting the government data to include the decline in the CPI are now also share Kroger’s overall market share increased. We plan to continue to grow our business by maintaining Kroger’s existing strong market share and building on additional opportunities for growth. Turning now to fiscal 2010, we anticipate identical supermarket sales growth up 2% to 3% without fuel. We expect net earnings to range from $1.60 to $1.80 per diluted share. Kroger’s quarterly dividend enhances total shareholder return by approximately 1.5% to 2%. We believe several factors that influenced our business in the last half of 2009 will continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2010. Inflation or deflation in product and operating costs, the competitive environment, fluctuating fuel margins and the pace of the economic recovery are uncertain and causes to be cautious about our fiscal 2010 forecast. We expect trends in these areas to influence our results throughout fiscal 2010. Five weeks into fiscal 2010, our identical sales trend is slightly ahead of the guidance range we have outlined. Please keep in mind, this trend benefited from the timing of the Super Bowl and snowstorms in many regions we serve. We do see plenty of opportunities to invest capital and generate strong returns on those investments in today’s environment. We expect to invest approximately 1.9 billion to 2.1 billion in capital projects with a strong bias towards remodels and infrastructure projects. Our remodel stores continue to generate favorable returns and we believe pursing a steady course of remodels keeps our assets fresh and inviting for our customers. Infrastructure projects we undertake are designed to enhance the overall shopping experience for our customers, which helps drive sales or improve efficiencies, which generates cost savings we can invest in our strategy. We expect to use free cash flow to maintain our current debt coverage ratios and reward our shareholders, both through share buybacks and quarterly cash dividends. I encourage you to take a look at the 8-K we filed earlier today, it contains additional details on Kroger’s 2010 guidance that maybe helpful to you. As we give annual guidance, we are often asked how we see earnings play out over the course of the year. This question is particularly important this year, given the volatility of 2009. We anticipate our first quarter 2010 results will be below the results we reported for the first quarter of 2009, assuming many of the operating conditions we experienced in the second half of 2009 continue into fiscal 2010. The second quarter should be more comparable with the prior year as we begun to lap many of the significant price investments we made in 2009. And we expect solid growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 assuming favorable trends in product and operating costs, the competitive environment, fluctuating fuel margins in the pace of economic recovery. Now I will turn it back to Dave.
Dave Dillon: Thank you, Mike. As we move forward in 2010, I am inspired by the overall performance of Kroger Associates in 2009. During the year that proved to be extremely trying, Kroger successfully achieved identical sales growth, increased the number of households loyal to Kroger stores and generated strong tonnage growth. In addition, we reduced debt, increased the dividend we pay shareholders and prudently invested capital to keep our stores and other assets fresh and innovative, strengthening our competitive position. During the last two years, we added 24,000 new jobs to support our growing business, a direct reflection of the health of our business. All of these achievements strongly support the continued growth of our company. As our performance during the quarter and throughout 2009 demonstrated Kroger’s strategy generates value and good times and bad. Our team knows how to compete effectively in any operating environment to strengthen the connection we have with our customers. We believe Kroger will continue to be in the best position to deliver shareholder value now and as the economy and consumer confidence improves. We now look forward to taking your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from a line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to poke at the selling gross margins a little bit and explore sequentially a decline, again, in trying to understand what’s driving at that competitive environment I know you guys have mentioned much about the competitive environment, but it seems to be improving. Are you seeing that selling gross margins now as you are in to the first quarter get better, and did you see it improve as you went through amidst the first quarter as in -- are you seeing -- did you see it improve during the fourth quarter, I know November was really tough?
Dave Dillon: Thank you, Scott. Let me comment this way, I would look at the fourth quarter selling gross investments as a continuation of what you saw what we saw in the third quarter. There’s two things to think about, first is that there was a certain trend or trajectory setup in the third quarter that continued at the end of the fourth and that’s actually partly what we saw. In addition, you’ve mentioned already the thanksgiving which we already indicated wasn’t that particularly strong holiday for us. Christmas on the other hand, we were pretty satisfied with. The other comparison that makes it a look little worse than it actually was, was a comparison to the prior year. And that’s true not only in the fourth quarter, which we just finished, but it will also be true, I think, in the first quarter when we report that out in June. That we had particularly strong, relatively speaking strong, gross profit quarters in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the first quarter of 2009. So, I don’t see it as anything other than that. As to the competitive market, we would say it's still aggressive, however it has shown some stabilizing, and as a result I think that I wouldn’t blame the gross profit investment is continuing more aggressive competition, I think it really is just the factors that I described.
Rodney McMullen: And in addition in terms of the deflation and some of those factors that we would have had, we continue to see that, and as Dave mentioned when you have swinging grocery from inflation to deflation a 1000 basis points, that certainly creates some pressure on gross and we would expect those types of pressure to diminish, especially as we have past the first quarter.
Dave Dillon: I agree in adding that particular point, in fact that by itself probably can produce this kind of a delta from the third quarter.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: So, maybe backing up, and I appreciate that answer, the color. Backing up a little bit, Dave, we talked a little bit about how EBITDA dollars have been growing at a slower pace in sales, before we even gotten to this economic malaise. I was just wondering if you kind of reflected back how, and customer first, how you get EBITDA dollars kind of growing faster than sales, should we start leveraging and getting the returns moving in the right direction, I mean, do you think there is lots of leverage for the company to pool and do you think we get that done some time in fiscal year 2010?
Dave Dillon: Well, I think the – I certainly sympathize with the objective you are describing. I’d like to take a multi-year look at the question. If you go back three or four years ago, we had several years where it played out pretty nicely, where our gross profit investment was about the same or little less than what we invested – what we saved in cost. And we have indicated and it still is our objective to invest what we can save but not to invest more than what we can save. Then 2008 was a little bit off track with that, and we admitted that and recognized that, and it was little different than what we think our norm ought to be. But then the economy really got off the rails and I really continued to see 2009 as an anomaly. As I said before, I don’t think the financial results, even though I think on a relative basis they were good, I don’t think they fully reflect the progress we made in the year. I think we actually had a strong year. But on the metric you are looking at, in an economy like that we are just not going to see that happen. I do think it comes around over time though, whether you see it in 2010, it is purely after lots of factors. I am pretty sure you won't see it in the first quarter or the second quarter of 2010. But as we indicated by the third and fourth quarter, you may be able to see some improvement in that, and the year should not end up being quite like the first and second quarter might imply.
Mike Schlotman: And as Dave just mentioned, we would certainly expect when you look at the third and fourth quarters that you would start seeing slight improvement in operating margins, it's really consistent with our long-term model.
Dave Dillon: Yeah, and I think we fully expect the picture you described and what we hope to see latter part of the year to be much more a norm. Going forward once some of these factors have stabilized or improved.
Scott Mushkin – Jefferies: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Little more color on the gross margin, and I guess when you think about '09, the problem you got into I guess is that, you had some initiatives in place in early part of the year, say you take us – the term you used was gunpowder used a lot of gunpowder in the first half, not really exciting to opening gunpowder in the second half. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the timing of your gross margin investment plan throughout 2010?
Mike Schlotman: Well, I don’t think we’ll give specifics on it. I will tell you that we have attempted to learn the lesson from 2009, so that first we would put whatever investments we plan in a more measured way, and we would do it a way that recognizes – in fact you can look at our guidance and realize that 2010 in our view is going to be an uncertain year. It's hard to predict, much like 2009 was. So the lessons of 2009 for us was that, be cautious, be ready to move and change through the year, and we are going to try to leave room and our plans to enable us to do that. But, we recognized it is an uncertain year and it will be a little hard to predict what that back half is going to look like. I think we could see with the first period -- first quarter or two might look like that it’s harder to see what that back half is going to look like.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: So, I mean, just philosophically, I guess, do you -- I mean help us understand, we understand why do you think you need to be as promotional as you are being, I mean, you have a loyal, you have an unbelievably loyal household customer base, could you not let up a little bit on the gross margin investments?
Dave Dillon: Well first it’s not really being promotional. A lot of our investments are in everyday pricing plan, what you would think of as everyday pricing plan, and some promotions which is different type of contrast that was being promotional, programs, for instance, the gas program is an example of that. But, some of the programs once you get them started and you give customers where they like them, whether it’s everyday pricing or some other program to take it away, runs the risk of derailing the very process you got started. And, we drew those conclusions actually going into the third quarter and recognized that we needed to be careful about making adjustments. We did indicate last quarter and we did make some minor adjustments and continue to make some adjustments in our tactics, but the strategy itself is the same as we have been describing and we think we believe it would be a long-term mistake to have a change course. Our promotional levels really from the point of view that you described haven’t really changed very much. Now we have a full bag from them but we really have not gotten more aggressive I mean maybe some individual cases you could describe but on the whole that’s not been the case.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: And what do you think from your competitors in terms of promotional?
Dave Dillon: No, we saw in the third quarter as we mentioned that things got a lot more aggressive. I believe a lot of that was because of what happened with the economic environment and what was happening with people sales. And, most people thought their sales going down might be the result of them not being strong enough as the competitors so they got more aggressive. Then discovered, as all of us have, is that there is some weakening in sales trends because of the economy and I think that’s caused people now to stabilize a little; still very aggressive but promotions that are out there on a weekly basis from our competitors remain strong, but we don’t see it getting more erratic or more unpredictable or deeper. It seems a little bit more of the same, to be more predictable now because we know what’s going on.
Karen Short – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks very much for taking my questions.
Dave Dillon: All right. Thanks, Karen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company. You may proceed.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Thanks, good morning. Dave, also that comment in terms of your long-term thinking and re-adjusting over the last three to six months, maybe just down the rethinking through some long assumptions in the last three to five years, are you scared right now, not just looking at 2010 but maybe the next three to five years, what has really changed within your mind, within your business model? Is there anything that you feel like you need to structurally shift a few degrees to either respond to what has changed in the consumer behavior, the consumer climate or more importantly the flow-through of your model in terms of driving the top line?
Dave Dillon: I think we actually continue to feel pretty strong about our plan and our model. I think the areas that we have identified, that we have not done as good a job in, reducing our costs on an ongoing basis while we have done a decent job there, we have not done a stronger job there as we would like to do, and as we believe we can do, as we believe the opportunity presents itself to do. And, we see that as the ticket really to be able to have more to invest not just in price, I realize in this environment and with this kind of investment in gross that appears all about price but actually it's not, and a lot of what we do has more to do with the other three keys and not just the price key. But I would say that we see the model pretty much like we saw before, we just think we need to get to some more normal times for you to be able to more graphically see it. The rate of deflation and the suddenness of that deflation and the persistence of that deflation, frankly surprises as we indicated last quarter. And I think it has masked the otherwise strong results of the program we have in place. I can't tell you how important it is to look at the growth that we had in loyal customers at Kroger. That is significant. It's the growth in the households that shopper does most often, and we've seen it now for some time, but we saw not only that happen but we also see over the course of the month that they are buying more items in those loyal households. All of which are really healthy signs, and are signs that as the world improves, you’ll begin to see – we believe you’ll begin to see in our financial results.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: I actually wanted to follow-up on some of those loyal household metric that you look at, and that’s obviously has been quite a bit of change in consumer behavior, and I haven’t heard quite some time actually through all of this gross margin pinch, but as you look through the data or try to approach it, maybe a little bit differently there. I am curious if you have different tactics or different tools now to maybe reset the bar even a different way to go after those loyal households who have build up the best customers versus the price sensitive customers. Is there anything that you have tweaked there that could be more of a sales callous [ph] and as not as diluted potentially to margins going forward?
Rodney McMullen: Jason, this is Rodney. If you look at, certainly we would be looking at – a little different strategy approach to each customer segment, and one of the things that I think it's important to note when we talk about the tonnage growth and our strong household growth, we had it with all customer segments. So if you look at upscale customers or if you look at value customers or mainstream customers, we had very similar growth across all those customer segments. And we do approach each customer segment a little different, and each one of the offers would be a little different for each customer segment. We think that some of the changes that we’ve had in gross and other things is much more driven by the swing from inflation to deflation, the speed of that swing and the competitiveness reacted because of that. We don’t think it's something that’s fundamental going on to the business other than what's happening today.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: And my final thought on that particular point in terms of deflation, obviously you quantify the deflation, and it is more wholesale versus retail but, and the tonnage growth there’s a general range there. How significant do you also see mix and the price you’ve seen within mix and the treating down in lower price points in general as customers have been migrating toward that, and is there – or even within categories or brands versus probably, how significant is the mix pressure been in the basket over the last six, 12 months?
Mike Schlotman: If you look at over the last six to 12 months, basket changes have been pretty painful and aggressive, certainly through trading down and other things. Now if you look at more recent data, we are starting to see some improvements in a few selected areas. If look at like our jewelry business had a very strong quarter. If you look at our coffee shops, some of those other things, we are beginning to see some improvement in basket but it's very, very early in that process. But if you look at over your question on the six to 12 months, there was a quite a bit of headwind. If you look at much more recent, we are starting to see a few small glimmers of hope.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Thank you.
Rodney McMullen: Jason, one other thing I would add to Jason’s question when you look at the long-term thinking it’s a balance between OG&A and gross, we see tremendous opportunities to continue to reduce costs of doing business through process change. In addition to that, if you look at the free cash flow we would expect to generate every year, we would continue to use that to pay the dividend, reduce debt and buyback stock. So that’s a couple of other things, elements to that strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Feeney with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may proceed.
Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott: Good morning. Thank you very much.
Dave Dillon: Good morning, Jon.
Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott: I am wondering if you’ve seen, there is a lot of talk about -- you talk about market share, for a decade it seems like the -- given that non-traditional retailers were gaining share for a while, it seem like that stabilized particularly for Kroger, and now when we at non-traditional retailers it seems like this more deflationary environment has brought that boogey man back, if you will. I guess, how high to inflation or deflation is the ability of non-traditional retailers to gain share do you think from longer-term perspective?
Dave Dillon: I actually don’t think there is a relationship in that question, it’s my personal view. The only way we play out to where there is a relationship is if the change in inflation or deflation occurred in say in the non-food categories, different than it did in food then it will tend to affect the behavior and the abilities of the non-traditional competitors, but otherwise I don’t see that as a element that is particularly important in that environment.
Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott: Thanks. And just one follow-up, if you wouldn’t mind? There are certain items where they are -- particularly dairy that there are those on the manufacturing side who think have been used as a traffic driver to a much, much greater extent, say the past six months. Have you seen dairy or any other particularly perishable category used more as a traffic driver by your competitors, and if so, how much has that changed at all in the first quarter?
Dave Dillon: Well, first, dairy is one of the most important categories in almost any way you want to look at it particularly as you think about where customers want to shop. So, we pay a lot of attention to it. It’s also important from your point of view because it’s such a big part of our overall business and so it can affect the results by itself single handedly it can affect our results. But what we have seen this past year, we had a period of time where the cost on dairy were quite low through the year, and as a result it was used in many promotional ways throughout the year throughout the industry. However, now the cost have begun to rise, and as they begin to rise, typically at least, it ends out getting a football slightly differently or maybe a little less. And so, I think I characterize fourth quarter as a little less aggressive on milk, than it was earlier in the year.
Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott: And how about so far in the first quarter?
Dave Dillon: We won’t add any comments on the first quarter on milk.
Jon Feeney – Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dave Dillon: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Couple of things, what do you think the natural or automatic growth rate in operating expenses O&A would be prior to any proactive cost reduction effort on your part? What do you think that, that inflation rate in cost would be?
Mike Schlotman: Haven't quite thought of it that way. I think in part it depends upon what ends with the sales and tonnage. But Rodney you want to –?
Rodney McMullen: I mean if you didn’t factor in tonnage or anything else, I think probably 2% to 3% would be a pretty good number to use.
Mike Schlotman: That’s probably fair.
Rodney McMullen: If you just want to use a rough expectation.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Because what I am trying to think about is, what is the comp you need? I know it depends on tonnage to a degree, what is the comp you need in a normal environment to get leverage on expenses if we assume. Gross isn’t going to move that much. And it would seem that you could probably do that on 2% to 3% or certainly the upper end of that range. I don’t know if you agree with that. And then secondly, you made reference to being able to make some process improvements. How low do you think you could get that or change that breakeven comp? If it is 2.5% to 3%, could you have an environment where you get leverage that have that or is that too much to ask?
Mike Schlotman: Well, I understand the nature of your question. I tend to believe that we did get leverage in 2009, even though the basis point change for the year, I know G&A was not high. And I’d describe it for this reason, let me describe it maybe in this context. First, process change as we introduce it leads to better productivity and allows you to get leverage even when there is not much change in sales growth. And we certainly had some of that last year and the benefit of some of that last year. Second is we get leverage from tonnage, now it didn’t show – that part didn’t show up as much because of the deflation, have we not had the deflation. I think that would have shown up very strongly, as a matter of fact. And so we would have easily been there. And it's those factors really that lead me to conclude that 2009 we had good leverage, we expect to have a good leverage in 2010. But obviously when you get some positive growth in identical sales it begins to shrink rather quickly. And the advantage really, the big advantage is, look at our relative position to our competitors. We have been growing our positive identical sales now for a long time, and many of our competitors have not. I mean one of the things we strive to do is to get leverage at flat identicals. Now, time will tell whether we are able to identify and create enough of those opportunities, for that’s true or not. But as we mentioned earlier, we see plenty of opportunities to continue to reduce cost through process change, and we think we have a ton of those examples in 2009 because we were able to reduce OG&A as a percent of sales with tonnage growth significantly higher than what our identical sales growth was.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then, I guess, related to that just finally, you guys do take a long-term view of the P&L, and your view historically has been that EBIT margin would be pretty flat ex-fuel, and that was when we were back at around 3.5. We are now close to the three, because what’s happened in the last year and a half. Is there the new base, that you work also from a flat standpoint or do you think it’s a somewhat depressed number because of deflation, and 3.5 is still the right base one day to work off of?
Mike Schlotman:
 :
Rodney McMullen: And as Dave and I both mentioned, we would certainly expect to have modest improvement once we get through kind of the changes -- the headwind from the deflation on sub we are going through right now, and where that ultimately can be it’s hard to say. We do really make sure -- we focus to make sure we are earning more than our cost-to-capital and certainly slightly at this higher than 3% we are earning more than our cost-to-capital and strive to continue to slightly improve that from where we are.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Ed Kelly from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning.
Dave Dillon: Hi, Ed.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: I have a question for you; I want to come back to the gross margin, it seems to me like the gross margin this year is a lot more complicated than what it’s been historically. Historically, we just look at the selling gross margin that’s what you invest in pricing, and you get some return on that. This year it seems like you have already talked about the negative impact of mix. I heard you talked about after the last quarter that you may not gone to return you are hoping forms on vendors programs and you are just aggressive on pricing on categories because of the competitive response. Could you -- as we think about the 90 plus basis point decline in the selling gross margin this year, how much of that is sort of an unusual decline based on the environment? And then, as we think about into next year and particularly into the back half, as things begin to normalize again, could we see the selling gross margin up as you cycle what would be some of these unusual impacts on the results?
Dave Dillon: That’s an interesting question. First of all, I think the investments that you see in the basis points last year in 2009 certainly were deeper than I think would be enormous if we were to write a description of multiple years over time. I think what the future holds is going to be highly dependent upon our ability to reduce costs because if we could reduce more costs it maybe a little more, maybe not more investment in this past year, but more than what I would have otherwise thought. On the other hand, if we don’t, we will be a lot more conservative. I do tend to think that the long-term trend though will be down not because we are trying to make it go down, but because I think that’s the pressures of the overall industry and I mean, now the nontraditional competitors and the traditional competitors, the pressure that brings to bear in the industry will tend to keep pressure going down a little, but not dramatically, at least that’s my personal view. So, I think I can see both directions. Now, whether we would see it actually go up, it’s certainly possible and we’re not trying to keep it from going up. Our objective is not to drive gross margin down, that’s not our plan, it’s not our objective. Our objective is to try to balance this out and to pick those areas that really matter to the customer and generally that is meant an investment in gross profit and so we follow that direction. But if costs, for instance, in the industry radically changed in an upward direction, I would think all of us will tend to move gross margins up a bit in order to cover that, and I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if that were the outcome, but that’s pretty hypothetical and looking out in the future, I don’t foresee that as the likely scenario.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: When you talk about the prospects for a better second half and expansion in the operating margin, is that because you are talking about the IDs [ph] continuing to get better when you get leverage on that? Is there, I guess, sort of same question, is there a possibility here the gross margin helps that in the back half of next year?
Dave Dillon: We think in the back half that the sales dollars becomes stronger because of the change in inflation from deflation. We think that we get traction on some of the programs we had in place last year and introduced this year. We think that as the market begins to improve a little bit from a customer point of view, from an economy point of view, because it looks like that’s the trajectory in a way. And we think we get benefit of cost reductions, and that plays out all in a way that produces a little better outcome. So, yes to all of your examples I’d say.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just quickly for your last question. Now that we’ve seen an improvement in the credit markets, other companies have been buying back stock a bit more aggressively, and you look at over historically, I mean, you go back ’06, ‘07’,08, you go up back at least $600 million annually, and the level of your stock price was higher than where it is today. So why not get more aggressive with the share repurchase at this point?
Dave Dillon: Mike, you want to comment on it?
Mike Schlotman: As Rodney and I both said, we plan to use our free cash flow to maintain our current coverage ratios to keep the BBB flat we have, particularly as we enter a year where our credit agreement expires in November of ’11, so this is a critical year. Probably we will be redoing that this year because you don’t want to go current on it. So we think it’s important to maintain the BBB flat, and we would use incremental cash to reward share – incrementally reward shareholders through a dividend or stock buyback.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital. You may proceed.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Thanks very much. I’d like to talk a little bit more about the deflation situation. It sounds like from what you are saying that the biggest impact on sales and profitability certainly in the fourth quarter was from dry grocery. Do you have sense of when that category, whether I should say it’s a very big category but becomes inflationary. Do you think that's going to happen even in the third quarter of 2010 because it didn’t become deflationary, I guess, but I guess it did in the third quarter of '09, right, so you could see it in the second half?
Mike Schlotman: Yes. Certainly our expectation would be as you get through the second quarter, I’d expect that it still would be slightly deflationary but the swing versus prior year won't be as painful. And then as you get to the third and fourth quarter, we would not expect to see the deflation on top of deflation to the same degree.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And would you say that's been had the biggest impact on the gross margin rather as opposed to perishable, which were also deflationary last year?
Mike Schlotman: I think it's – to me that's one of those things, but it's a good question but it's very hard to answer, because that certainly is part of it. As Dave has mentioned couple of times on the third quarter and this quarter, once you have that you also have changes in competitive reaction too. And to be able to separate the two, I don’t know that we can. On perishables it's all over the Board, and sometimes the deflation helps them, sometimes it hurts, sometimes that gives you an opportunity to have a great price point, and I think on several things in 2009 that the deflation had produced in dairy and a few other categories gave all retailers opportunity to be aggressive on a price point, and it really caused everybody to react to that.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then --
Dave Dillon: Meredith, I want to make sure everybody remembers that when we talk about grocery inflation and deflation, it's not just dry grocery, it includes our dairy department.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. That's right.
Dave Dillon: Okay.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: And then if you had mentioned that you’re still not quite as pleased with reductions and expenses as you would like to be done a lot, but perhaps didn’t hit your own internal goal, could you talk about what the obstacles have been to getting to those goals and what will be different in 2010?
Dave Dillon: Well the issue for us really is not, we have found a lot of little smaller areas to focus on, and some even big ones that if we have had got success on, but the issue for me is understanding the nature of process change, how to introduce it successfully and how to have it cause us to pull cost out of our organization. It’s the kind of thing that takes, that has a long runway and it’s not something that you say today I am going to save a bunch of money and then next quarter you can show the money you saved for. And while we have been working on it for a long time and actually have a number of examples that fit that description pretty well, we have not gotten quite traction on some of the bigger areas that we would like to achieve. We think it’s there, we see the opportunity there. It’s teaching an old dog some new tricks, I think in my case our organization of how to do some of these things. And so, I think it’s really a long-term thing that as leaders of the organization we will solve.
Rodney McMullen: And the only thing I would add to that, I mean, Dave mentioned that we found and executed a ton of incremental improvements that did help us leverage OG&A expense with tremendous tonnage growth. Now with that said, we believe there is even some bigger opportunities with fundamental process changes and those have been harder to recognize and get in place, but we think that potential is out there and that’s when we talk about being pleased with the short-term, but not so pleased with the longer terms those are the things we’re referring to.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Well it sounds like you are saying it’s just a function of time really?
Dave Dillon: Well, it’s time but it’s also an organization learning how to do these things, it’s both.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then I have one final question, you made a comment, I think it was an answer to Karen’s question about maybe letting up on some of this promotion and you said while the customers that used to what they have – it would be hard to take it away, but it seems like you are, to some extent, being incrementally better to them, more generous to them, and I guess I don’t quite understand why you can’t from a year-over-year perspective, kind of hold it here, why does it have to keep going down?
Dave Dillon: Well, let me describe it this way. The programs that you start once -- once started, customers begin to see it as who you are and your personality and why they shop with you, and to pull that away would be problematic. Now, as to whether now we need to introduce new things, the question is whether now we feel we can get sufficient growth and tonnage and in growth in loyal households without introducing anything new, we tend to think that some change-up is important to customers just simply from the point of view you being refreshed. The main message I was describing to Karen and to you both on promotions though is -- the things we are describing are not a matter of some hot price we put on an item and then add this week, which is what I think – here the other words promotion, and sure we have promotions every week, but we are not turning that up, not making that hotter that’s not the focus of our investment. And yet it is a part of our industry, and I would not expect that to go away either. So, I don’t know that I’ve really answered your question, except to say that I think we feel maybe it’s not to the tune of the 112 basis points of gross we had in the fourth quarter but some of that in this year on a relative basis, particularly in stable cost environment, I think some of that what would be more likely than not because we think that would be what will help us in our process of gaining customer loyalty.
Meredith Adler – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, Meredith.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. You may proceed.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Good morning everyone.
Dave Dillon: Good morning.
Mike Schlotman: Good morning.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Dave, you guys really are going to spend CapEx dollars this year not too far below the 2.3 billion of last year, which is different from a lot of your competitors. Can you talk about how that might be split up between remodels and infrastructure projects and give some examples of the infrastructure project. And talk about what's included in there in terms of simply buying leased properties. That might be a significant component of the number. And then also what you are doing with the convenient stores that from what I’ve read and seen, you have done some experimentation there such as the pharmacies and some of them that, is that a small format that has a lot of opportunity for you?
Mike Schlotman: Chuck, when you look at the CapEx guidance, it's actually very comparable to what we spent in 2009, the two three year reference is what's in the cash flow statement. There is a total of a couple of hundred million dollars roughly of some small acquisition, one store here and there as well as the lease buyouts. The $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion excludes any opportunity to buyback leases or any acquisition dollars. So the number we've talked about in the conference call, 2.15 is the number that would equate to the 19 to 21. So it's a pretty comparable number. We do think that there will be some new stores that we deal in 2010. We gave the number of our expectation for the number of remodels. We think that’s a very healthy program and we continue to get returns above our 11.3% of hurdle rate from those investments. I won't go into specific infrastructure projects, just because of the nature of them. They are pretty important to us from what I spoke up earlier. Some of them help improve the shopping experience that becomes a sales driver for our customers and that helps to fuel the top line, which creates incremental leverage. There are others out there that are cost savings initiatives that allows to have the dollars to execute with Rodney and David, we’re talking about to save dollars permanently to invest back in the model, where we are doing pricing or one of the other keys.
Dave Dillon: Rodney, you want to comment on the C-stores?
Rodney McMullen: On the C-stores, I’d just add that there is a couple of different things that we experiment with to say that’s going to be a major part of the growth over the next few years, I think it's too early to say. That’s one of those things that you continually try to learn and see if you are going to approach it from a different perspective for the customer and see how they react to it.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Okay. And then finally, Dave, when you talk about the reversal of deflation some point this year, that implies to me that we’re going to some modest inflation, but it also implies increasing prices on the shelf. So how much of a rebound in inflation would be too much to pass through?
Dave Dillon: Well, we fully expect within these things we think it’s very reasonable. We fully expect that inflation will be pass through, the cost inflation will be pass through and retail prices. And, I think that’s the more normal approach, and I think that would be what we would expect to happen in the year. Now, whether or not you are going to have too high of inflation that could cause that to not happen, it might be a function of too high inflation and also it might be a function of what the inflation is in. Sometimes when you have radical change too quick of change we have illustrated that on the downside this past year, and you can have the same problem on the upside, you’ve heard us occasionally to see that in milk, for instance, when it changed abruptly. I think you are probably refereeing to the lot of the economic forecast suggest that with the amount of money thrown into the economy that there ought to be a major inflation around the corner. Everything I have heard and read suggests that if that happens it’s going to be a long way off.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing you keep in mind on inflation, Chuck is it base point on where it occurs and how it encourages the most important part of that answer. If we have flat to 1% inflation, but it’s driven by a lot of inflation in products and made in deflation in grocery even though it comes out to slight inflation that’s bad because you’ve got deflation in a very big category and a quick inflation in a perishable category is tough to manage your way through and as always, the speed of change from either direction is makes it difficult for everybody to manage their way through.
Dave Dillon: And we have always felt that the easiest to manage the business in is 3% to 4% inflation, but I wouldn’t want to go from where we are to 3% to 4% in a month, but would mind 3% to 4% over time as long as we get there gradually.
Chuck Cerankosky – Northcoast Research: Thanks. That’s what I want to think about as opposed to some macroeconomics forecast and say hyperinflation for the next five years, I was more thinking in terms of what you just described. Thank you very much.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, Chuck. I think we have a time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital. You may proceed.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Do you think the rate of deflation dwarfed in the Q4, that’s my first question. Have we seen the bottom here?
Dave Dillon: Well, as we described in the quarter it certainly got in grocery particularly a little bit deeper. Mike, is going to take a look at the graphs to see if he has opinion that he wants to describe.
Mike Schlotman: I would say it's pretty difficult to say it has a trough not until we get some insight and vision in the where the first quarter is looking and our first period just closed so we don’t have where what nearly looking to what the first quarter of 2010 is looking like, but overall we had more deflation in the fourth quarter. It would be nice if it’s hit the trough but until we have more insight as we go through the first quarter it will be difficult to declare that.
Dave Dillon: I don’t expect the trough to be short either, the trough could go all the way through the quarter.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And on the branded tonnage growth, catching up to private label, can you talk a little about what’s driving that? Is that vendors the branded companies trying to get movement and passing that through to you all or is it consumer may be looking more to brand and…?
Dave Dillon: As we said, national brand tonnage was up, for it’s a positive number up about the same as where Kroger brand, tonnage was up. And as you look at that we think it's driven actually by both of the things you are referring to. First, it's driven by national vendors needing to drive more volume, and so investing in the promotional strategies of their products. And second is, I actually take it as one sign of some glimmer of hope of improvement, Rodney described jewelry and some other discretionary categories that have improved. I think a trend up a little bit in tonnage and national brand is a similar positive sign. Now how much is due to the consumer changing and how much is due to the vendors investing? I don’t know that, I would try to judge that. And if you remember, I guess, it was probably a year ago, or three quarters ago, Dave talked about on our corporate brands, he would expect when the economy start to getting better that you could actually have negative growth in corporate brands for a little while, and it wouldn’t surprise him. And to me one of the things that I was very pleased with is if you look at our corporate brands, we continue to have extremely strong growth there, and a year ago we had double-digit growth both in units and dollars. So to me it's – I feel good about one the balance, and I feel good it is starting to show a little bit, the economy is getting better, but our corporate brand program has connected with customers in a different way and deeper, and they continue to reward us by buying more of that product.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Got it. Just one last question. Dave, I think you mentioned the last five weeks or the first five weeks of this quarter, the comp it sounds like it's pretty strong, is that? And the Super Bowl aspect of that, is that the calendar or are you trying to tell us you had a very strong Super Bowl? And if it is calendar, can you give us sort of what the adjusted comp is trending?
Dave Dillon: Well, first it's both. We had a very good Super Bowl, but Super Bowl this year was a year later than it was the year before.
Rodney McMullen: A week later
Dave Dillon: Yes, week, later -- yes year later, a week later and the year before and some of the players in super bowl year were still been a year later, but any way it was week later and that made it sell in the selling time and the super bowl itself fell in this year and not in last year and that’s the primary thing. We are not going to try to quantify that; we have lot of things going on at that time. We had some snow storms which also Mike referred to and first of the month, and so it’s sort of a triple opportunity that with the super bowl first in the month and snow storm that was suddenly felt. But, if you try to normalize all of that, that’s why we indicated that while we are a little bit above the trajectory of what we saw for the year and that certainly gives us reason for optimism we want to make sure you don’t over read it because of the super bowl and snow.
Mike Schlotman: And even without that week we would still be within the range.
Dave Dillon: Yes, if you take that out we would have been.
Mike Schlotman: So it is still not – that’s not the only reason why that we are pleased so far, but we would expect the quarter-to-quarter, the first quarter would certainly be tougher than the third and first quarter.
Andrew Wolf – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Well, that clarifies, especially the latter comments. Thanks and good job in such tough environment.
Dave Dillon: Andy, thank you. Before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional thoughts with our associates. First of all, I want to thank you for your hard work not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2009. It was a very tough year. The economic environment was unyielding and that affected all of you and all of our customers. Still you accomplished where many others in the industry could not. You found ways to build even stronger connection with our customers through your creativity and enthusiasm for selling. Our customers noticed, they continued to spend more in our family of stores this quarter and we thank you for making their experience with us rewarding. The challenges ahead in 2010 will be similar to the ones we faced last year. I am confident in your ability to continue to make a positive difference in the lives of our customers and your coworkers throughout your efforts every day. Recently Katy Barclay joined Kroger to head and lead our human resource function. I want to welcome Katy to Kroger and recognize the work of our HR team, especially Katy, Della Wall and Chuck Schaeffer in improving the process of our associate tracker survey. Soon you’d be hearing more from your managers and supervisors about the results of our most recent associate tracker survey. Thank you for taking time to complete the surveys and sharing your feedback with us. We've heard from over 246,000 associates across the US, wow. We value your input and we use it as we work to improve Kroger and make it a great place to work. Thanks for all you do. That completes the call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2009 Kroger Company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. We recognize that the third quarter results we reported earlier today differ significantly from the outlook we shared with you when we reported Kroger’s second quarter results in September. For that reason, we are modifying the structure of today’s call from our typical format. Today our prepared remarks will address the factors that caused our third quarter results to differ from our internal projections. We aim to provide you with a better understanding of our current business environment and our plans going forward. We do not plan to use this time to repeat financial information provided in Kroger’s third quarter earnings release. Finally, our prepared remarks will be shorter in order to allow more time to address investors’ questions. I will now turn the call over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon: Thank you, Carin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me today to review Kroger’s third quarter 2009 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The operating environment has proven to be more difficult than we expected and our performance during the quarter clearly reflects it. We came up short in several aspects of our performance. We have deflation in sales, making expense leverage difficult, a sharply more competitive environment that is now widespread, and cautious consumers. These factors led to results below our expectations. However, our short-term results obscured some otherwise strong fundamentals in our performance such as exceptional tonnage growth, market share gains in key segments, increases in loyal household count and good cost control. These fundamentals are important to our long-term success and creating shareholder value. For the second consecutive quarter, deflation accelerated in most grocery categories. Last year at this time, we had estimated inflation of 6%. This year we estimate deflation to be minus 0.8% -- a nearly 700 basis point swing year-over-year. More important, deflation was particularly acute in categories like milk, produce, meat and grocery. We certainly sold more units, as any associate who stocked dairy or produce departments can attest, but at much lower retail prices. Based solely on our tonnage, we had a solid quarter. In fact, our tonnage during the quarter would have generated identical supermarket sales above our original annual guidance were it not for the continued deflation. As a result of continuing deflation affecting our sales and higher tonnage and customer count, which increases workloads throughout our organization, it has been more difficult to leverage expenses. In addition, the current economy has slowed employee turnover rates, increasing average hourly wages and health care benefit costs. But overall, as demonstrated by a lower OG&A rate, excluding fuel, we did a good job of managing expenses. We also saw competition increase. Continuing a trend we saw last quarter, pricing and promotional activity increased to include more of our competitors, expanding to more of the markets we serve. Even so, we continue to gain market share, which is critical to Kroger’s long-term success. Compounding matters is the economy. The environment continues to create cautious consumers. Some are choosing to be more disciplined in their spending and are buying down, while others are holding back altogether on purchases because they simply don’t have the money to spend. As a result of all these factors, we have revised our guidance for both full-year identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth. We now expect full-year identical supermarket sales growth of 2% to 2.5%, without fuel for fiscal 2009. This guidance assumes that third quarter deflationary trends continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. So far, identical supermarket sales for the fourth quarter after four weeks are running about the same as the third quarter. We have also revised our 2009 earnings per share guidance. We now expect full-year fiscal 2009 earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share. This guidance excludes the southern California impairment charges recorded in the third quarter. While these revised forecasts are below what we had expected to deliver for the year, we believe they appropriately reflect the challenges of the current environment, which continues to be characterized by significant deflation, cautious consumer spending and more aggressive competition. Kroger’s continued growth in tonnage and loyal households and our competitive advantages position Kroger and our shareholders to benefit once operating conditions improve. Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, we expect current operating conditions to extend at least through the first half of the year. Deflation is expected to moderate throughout the year, and we will be cycling many of the price investments we put in place during the first half of 2009. We expect the combination of these factors will produce identical sales growth, excluding fuel, and earnings per share growth, both above forecasted 2009 full-year results, of course excluding the southern California impairment charges. Now, Rodney will offer you additional perspective on the quarter. Rodney.
W. Rodney McMullen : Thank you, Dave. Good morning everyone. Customer traffic in our stores continues to improve and growth in loyal households continues to be strong. Loyal households represent our very best customers. Our data show these customers are making more trips to our stores and buying the same number of items per visit they did during the same period last year. So, over the course of a month, these households are buying more items from Kroger than they were a year ago, which indicates they are consolidating more of their spend with us. In addition, visits from all households we track rose in the third quarter. This is driving outstanding unit growth for our business. During the first half of the year, we initiated several pricing programs to attract and retain cautious customers. These programs have cost us more than we originally anticipated. They have also resulted in tonnage increases much higher than we anticipated, an excellent trend in the long-term. But in the current environment, more intense and pervasive competitive activity coupled with deflation that has yet to moderate as we anticipated, led to results below our expectations. We are seeing more sales at promotional levels as customers in all segments have become more conservative in their spending. At the same time, we have noticed a marked change in pricing programs at many competitors as retailers compete aggressively for every dollar. We have revised our plans in order to respond effectively. As I mentioned before, strong overall tonnage growth was driven by Corporate Brand and national brand sales. Our Value Brands are clearly winning with customers who in previous downturns shopped elsewhere for this value proposition. National brand grocery tonnage was also up for the quarter. Tonnage growth was particularly strong in Dairy, Meat, Produce and Grocery as customers responded positively to lower prices. As this positive trend in tonnage growth continues, our associates are doing a phenomenal job keeping up with the increased volume. Our plant, warehouse and store teams are keeping up with what is quickly becoming a new “norm” for our business. Each month, customers are putting more items in their baskets because they are getting more for their money in our family of stores. We are encouraged by what this shift means for the long-term growth of our business. On the whole, the Kroger team did a good job controlling expenses during the quarter, particularly considering the deflated sales. The growth in our tonnage and loyal households, coupled with a deflationary environment, makes for a difficult environment to manage labor. Fortunately, our staffing models are based on tonnage, not sales. If not for that, our stores could be understaffed for the amount of business we are doing. But our customer-focused strategy and the labor management philosophy that supports it, helps us keep checkout lines short and stores in excellent condition so that our customers will want to return. Now turning now to labor relations, we reached a tentative agreement last month with the union representing our associates in Arizona. We also delivered a final offer to the union representing our Colorado associates. In both cases, associates will be voting on those new contracts during the next few weeks and we are hopeful they will be ratified. Negotiations in Atlanta and Portland continue and are now underway in Dallas. We have contract extensions in those markets. Rising health care costs and underfunded pension plans continue to be important issues in our labor discussions, in addition to the increased pressures on our business that we are now experiencing. Next, Mike will give you some perspective on other elements of the quarter, including the impairment charge related to our business in California. Before he does that, I want to emphasize how pleased we are with our team at Ralphs. They continue to do a terrific job in one of the most difficult operating environments in the country right now. High unemployment and real estate values that continue to deteriorate have clearly affected consumer behavior there. We remain confident in the ability of all of our associates at Ralphs to strengthen our position there. Mike.
J. Michael Schlotman : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our release, we have taken a non-cash asset impairment charge in the quarter that reduced Kroger’s earnings by $1.62 per diluted share. The impairment charge was the result of several factors. First, the economy in California is as weak as any in the country. Unemployment in California is at record levels at 12.5%, well above the national average. Over two-thirds of those who are unemployed live in Southern California, where Ralphs operates. High unemployment and population declines have caused us to revise our near-term profit projections for Ralphs. Finally, valuations for businesses are at historic lows. Due to all of these factors, we were required to write off the goodwill. Let me spend a minute on fuel -- as expected, lower fuel margins also pressured Kroger’s quarterly earnings. As you may recall, in last year’s third quarter, our retail fuel business experienced exceptionally strong margins of $0.239 per gallon of fuel sold. This year we earned, on average, $0.119 per gallon of fuel sold at our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers during the quarter. Lower fuel margins explain approximately $0.08 of the year-over-year decline in Kroger’s earnings per diluted share for the quarter. On a rolling four-quarters basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.107 this year compared to $0.156 for the same period a year ago. A normalized margin for this business is approximately $0.11 per gallon, and that is incorporated into our full-year earnings forecast for fiscal 2009. We continue to see positive identical gallon growth. Expanding our convenient fuel centers is an important part of our “one-stop shopping” value proposition for customers. Turning now to use of cash flow, in light of the current environment, we have reduced our internal capital plans by approximately $1 billion over the next three fiscal years. Our original plans did call for continued capital expenditure growth. We now expect capital expenditures to average under $2 billion a year over the next three years, based on current conditions. We plan to focus our capital expenditures on store remodels, infrastructure projects and expense reduction initiatives. This will strengthen Kroger’s free cash flow. We expect to use free cash flow to maintain our current debt coverage ratios and reward our shareholders. Now, I will turn it back to Dave.
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Mike. We hope our comments today give you a better understanding of what is happening in the current environment and our plans and priorities going forward. It should be clear that our strategy is based on customers and volume. In periods of deflation, this strategy helps us build market share and strengthen our long-term market share position, but clearly the short-term financial results suffer. Conversely, in periods of inflation, sales rise more significantly but tonnage movement is not as strong. We are confident that with the adjustments we are making, and as the inflationary picture improves, Kroger will be better positioned than many of our competitors. There are other changes we could have implemented that would have improved short-term results. But, in our judgment, they would have hampered our ability to grow market share, provide a good shopping experience for our customers and create value for our shareholders and opportunities for our associates. We would now be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) You have a question from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Thanks for all the details on the quarter. Kind of digging a bit more into how things played out by month, can you go through either by detail or even just at a higher level how month by month sales played out? Can you talk a little bit about the paycheck cycle and is there any impact on your business by more consumers being on food stamps or the impact of EBT?
David B. Dillon: Well, let me start with food stamps -- food stamps continued even just this last month of November, continued the last three months at as high a level as we have ever experienced, at least as far back as we’ve looked. And the last three months were a little bit higher than the months preceding, so if you looked at our third quarter, that means the first month of the third quarter would have been a little bit less food stamps and then it increased from there a little bit -- not a lot because it was already at a pretty high level. It affects the sales cycle in every state differently because each state has a different process to how they pay out the food stamps. Sometimes it’s the first of the month, sometimes it’s scattered between the first and the 10th and sometimes it’s stretched all through the whole month. But on the whole, we have seen an exaggeration of what’s happened at the beginning of the month and the end of the month. The end of the month for us has been poorer than we are used to seeing; the beginning of the month a little bit stronger than we have been used to seeing. And certainly the electronic benefits have increased dramatically when you compare say to three years ago.  You go back to three or four years ago, the food stamp volume we are currently running is not quite double but it’s a lot higher, so it’s very significant.  Now, as to the trends through the third quarter, Mike may want to check my facts on this but generally speaking, at the time of our earnings announcement for the second quarter release, would have been about four weeks into the third quarter, at that time we gave you a sense of where sales were. And from that point forward, they gently dropped in dollar sales but our tonnage continued reasonably strong and so it became a different quarter for us, almost -- I’d say almost from the moment we hung up the phone but it wasn’t quite that dramatic, but clearly it became more deflationary and it became more competitive from that point to the present time.  Does that give you a sense of what you are asking, Deborah?
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Yeah, that’s incredibly helpful -- and if you had to go back and obviously you’ve been in this business for a very long time, as has the management team as a whole -- if you were to go back, could you describe another environment in the past 20 or 25 years that was like this one and did the competition react similarly to how they have now, or is this kind of a new game?
David B. Dillon: Well, the environment itself, I would characterize as a new game. I have not ever seen anything like this or if I have, my ability to understand what was going on around me was so long ago that I maybe didn’t perceive what was happening. But put that aside and I think just use conventional knowledge of what typically happens and I think what we saw from a competitive point of view is pretty simple -- is that sales, as you’ve seen, many of our competitors, in fact most of our competitors, have reported negative sales, negative IDs, and when you are in that position it is pretty normal to try and reach out to say what can I do to try to change that. That automatically makes a market a little bit more promotional and a little more focused on price. So we shouldn’t have been really surprised that that occurred but it did occur clearly differently and a little more pronounced in the last half of the third quarter than what we had experienced earlier in the year. So I think that the behaviour you are seeing is actually pretty consistent with patterns in past cycles but I think the environment is a clearly different environment than what we have experienced before. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, and I just want to close it out with it sounds like you are gaining share with I think a very important customer base, which is your most loyal households. Is there anything you are doing different in terms of communicating with them to drive the additional footsteps or is that you think that they are just more aware in terms of some of the values that you are offering to them?
David B. Dillon: Well, remember, put this in context -- remember we’ve been on this journey now for multiple years and while it has a lot to do with price, it has an awful lot to do with other things. We talk about our four keys, well, price is one of the four keys but the other three keys are pretty important to our customers too and I think Rodney said it pretty well -- if you were to put a piece of masking tape over our sales dollars and look at all of our other data inputs, you’d go away saying well, this is a pretty good quarter. Our cost control was good, our growth in loyal households -- our growth in households even not looking at just a loyal but households on the whole grew. And in fact, all of the dimensions in the way we typically look at customer reaction has been strong, and so I would say that we believe it’s the accumulated affect of all of the things that we have done that came before.  One of the mistakes that we made in not just this quarter but earlier in the year is we committed a whole lot of our plan to some pricing strategies that we put in place much of -- most of which was put in place early in the year. We didn’t leave ourselves a lot of gun powder for later in the year if the market got more competitive, which it ended up doing. But we think some of the price positions that we took earlier in the year and other things we did helped generate what we are seeing today. These things have a long tail and they don’t produce results immediately but as a result of things we’ve done earlier in the cycle, I think gave us the good results that we’ve achieved with customers.  Rodney, do you want to add to anything?
W. Rodney McMullen : Well, I was just going to add a couple of comments on a couple of Deborah’s questions -- one, when you look at the cycle, if you go back and look at certainly from a recession standpoint, generally the supermarket industry lags by about six to 12 months on a cycle. And certainly if you look at where we are in the process right now, it certainly would suggest that that would be a similar type lag this time. Obviously the economy is starting -- it appears has stabilized and starting to get a little bit better in some spots, so if our historical trend is similar this time, it would be a similar type lag, I would expect.  The other thing in terms of what it looks like different today than before is our decline in average selling price per unit would be more this time than before. We think a lot of that is because before customers that we would lose in a recession, today we are keeping them and we think some of that decline is because of that. But if you look at -- certainly if you look at our average selling price per item, the decline is more this time than it would have been before. And we would have not had deflation to the degree that we have today. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, well thanks for all the color and best of luck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of BMO Capital Markets.
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Just a couple of housekeeping first and then some questions on your unit volumes. You normally give your product cost deflation and also private label as a percent of units and a percent of sales in the quarter. Do you have those handy?
W. Rodney McMullen : The private label units were 35% and the percent of sales were -- I don’t have it right in front of me -- 26%. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay. 
W. Rodney McMullen : So basically the same as the last quarter but still a growth over last year’s third quarter. Not as big a growth, but -- 
David B. Dillon: It was a slight growth from third quarter last year. We’ve now had I think four quarters in a row of about -- five quarters in a row of almost 35% or in the range of 35% of the units in grocery have been in Kroger corporate brands. 
W. Rodney McMullen : If you look at our corporate brand unit growth is basically double-digit range, very low. And that would have been on top of double-digit growth a year ago in the same quarter, so that’s actually stacked two quarters on top. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and your product cost deflation?
W. Rodney McMullen : It would be a negative 0.8% based on the way we estimate it. 
David B. Dillon: And that I tried to emphasize in my comments, that doesn’t really give you a good clear picture because that number, while a big swing from last year, seems like a small one but when you look at where the deflation occurred, it was in meat and produce and dairy and grocery are the biggest areas and those are really important areas. And so that’s really why I would emphasize that point.  We had some inflation in, as I recall, in general merchandise and in pharmacy and that tended to offset a little bit of the percentage that we would report as a total number. So I think it’s important to look at some of the categories that it occurred in. 
W. Rodney McMullen : Most of that inflation is driven by tax increases on cigarettes. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, the GM is mostly -- don’t draw any other conclusion other than the fact that cigarettes went up. 
W. Rodney McMullen : When taxes go up 25% or 30% -- 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and are you seeing deflation in grocery as in the center store excluding dairy now?
David B. Dillon: Yes, if you take dairy out, it’s not quite as deflationary as it is with dairy but it is still deflationary more than 1% deflationary, and --  
W. Rodney McMullen : Last quarter was inflationary. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, and that’s a good point -- Mike looked at last quarter for us and last quarter, grocery without dairy was actually an inflation number slightly and this quarter grocery without dairy was deflationary, so that’s a big change. And in fact, I think that’s the primary change I’m describing when I talk about the more deflationary environment than we experienced in the quarter before it. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: So on your tonnage, you gave that 8.5% unit volume in the quarter, or sorry in the Q for the second quarter and I just had one clarification on that -- first of all, was that unit volume at your stores or from your warehouse? And then I guess the second question is can you provide us with that number for the third quarter? Because it would see that it is higher this quarter than it was in the second. 
J. Michael Schlotman : It was at the stores and it’s just a little bit better than what was in the Q last quarter. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and then just turning to your triple B rating, I guess you had said that you needed -- if EBITDA declined by 2% for this full year, you would still maintain your triple B rating -- I guess with your new guidance, even at the high-end of the range on earnings, I get an EBITDA that is declining by about 4%. I know you also reduced your CapEx, so I’m just wondering where that situation may shake out in terms of maintaining your triple B rating. 
J. Michael Schlotman : That 2% estimate on that was actually the rating agencies when they put out their press release when we went to triple B flat. As you saw in the quarter, we did reduce debt and our net total debt to EBITDA ratio did improve over the same quarter last year. It went from 195 to 193. We would expect to be able to maintain our coverage ratio in the range that we need to to maintain our credit ratings and the reduction in capital over the next three years is to help us to satisfy that and reward shareholders. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, and then my last question is just on Ralphs in general, I mean, I guess could you address whether or not part of the situation with the write-down was your specific positioning in the market, because that would be the one market where you are viewed more as a quality operator as opposed to price, so could you maybe talk about that a little bit?
David B. Dillon: Well, I actually think the write-down came as a result of the change in values of businesses in that market, as hard hit as that area has been hit by the economy, and because of the impact of the economy on our customers on our current and future forecasts for cash flow from that division based on the consumer. We are quite bullish on Ralphs in particular. In fact, we believe in the last six months that our market share has actually grown slightly and that’s based on looking at A.C. Nielsen tracking data. We think that the market itself has shrunk a little and that’s actually what creates a lot of the problem. So I wouldn’t read anything into that write-down having to do with how pleased we are with Ralphs except that we are pleased with that team and their strategy and we believe in the long run that that’s going to be a good market for us.  The positioning, we would tend to be -- actually we are in lots of markets there, so it’s not just upscale. I don’t think -- what you are describing I think is maybe it’s hurt more proportionately because of upscale features but I don’t think that’s the case. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie of UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS: Could I just confirm what you said about tonnage growth, because I missed part of the answer, I’m sorry about that -- did you say that tonnage growth was higher in the third quarter than the second quarter and did you put a figure around that?
J. Michael Schlotman : We didn’t give a specific figure. In the Q last quarter, we disclosed it was 8.5% and it was slightly stronger than that in the third quarter. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Okay, so -- I mean, that’s -- so that’s just private brand? [Multiple Speakers]
J. Michael Schlotman : No, that’s total tonnage. 
David B. Dillon: I wanted to make sure I was using the right number. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Okay, so total tonnage is up more than 8.5% in the third quarter, so -- I mean, you must be very satisfied with that and for the long-term, that set you up very well. So really what I wanted to ask about is the cost of achieving that and whether you think that getting your gross margins down at these levels is a price worth paying for that tonnage growth?
David B. Dillon: Well, that’s a great question and I alluded to that earlier when I said that the strategies we put in place earlier in the year spent pretty much what we had projected to spend -- in fact, actually as I think we earlier indicated, spent a little more than we had originally planned because they were more successful than we had originally planned. And as a result then when the markets got a little more competitive, we needed to react to that situation requiring that we invest additional dollars.  So we would have to say for the quarter, we were disappointed in where our earnings ended up being but very pleased at where the tonnage was and how our customers reacted to our plan, so I think you could argue that yeah, in the quarter, maybe it was too much investment but we couldn’t roll the clock back very easily on what we had committed earlier in the year and we believed as I closed the discussion with, we believed that we didn’t want to make short-term changes that we thought would cause us bigger penalties in the long run, so that’s why we maintain the course. 
Neil Currie - UBS: I’d agree with that statement -- I’m just wondering more about the reactionary investment that you had made. Considering that your tonnage growth is so -- was so strong and you are happy with the planned investments, do you feel the need to respond to everything that competitors do? Wouldn’t 7% tonnage growth be great?
David B. Dillon: Well, that’s -- actually, yes it would and I agree with your point -- we do not need to respond to everything competitors do. We make a judgement call in each case, whether or not what the competitor is doing and how the consumers are responding is an important situation or not and we are responding to those that we think are important in protecting our franchise with the customer but we are -- we didn’t -- we did not in the third quarter and do not plan in the future to respond to every little thing that happens. We make judgement calls on each of those and I didn’t really specifically comment on Thanksgiving -- we gave you the sales so far, or a good indication of the sales so far this quarter and Thanksgiving of course is in the fourth quarter but Thanksgiving and sales and results were softer than we would have liked. And it was a pretty competitively contested holiday and so it fits the characterization you have, except that at holiday times we found with customers, it’s real important to make sure you protect your franchise. And so that’s actually one of the elements that is in our minds as we give you the new guidance for the rest of this year. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Okay, because my next question was going to be that obviously you missed by $0.10 in the third quarter but the fourth quarter you’ve taken guidance down by I guess another $0.20, so that wouldn’t imply that you are going to take your foot off the pedal in terms of reactionary investments, or are you just being over-cautious here?
David B. Dillon: Well, I won’t say we are being over-cautious but I will indicate that we felt that we did not properly read the market in the second quarter release when we were telling you where the third quarter and the rest of the year would come out, and I fault myself and as we looked at that, we did not read the market right and we are trying to stand back from it now and read it more accurately for you and to try to describe all the factors that we know about. And given that the two major holidays in the fourth quarter, one of them has already passed, we already know the data and we can share with you that it was a soft holiday for us in sales and the earnings results were softer than what we would have liked to have and so when we take those things into account and look at how unpredictable this environment has been, we had to leave a lot more room than we might ordinarily have left with only one quarter left in the year. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Okay, and then on 2010, I mean, historically you have really focused on the top line and your stated policy is really to hold operating margins relatively flat but given the sort of investment that you have seen this year, would you maybe in the second half of 2010 and beyond be now looking to recover some of this over-invested margin?
David B. Dillon: Well, I think what we are going to see next year is we will have to see it as we go but we would expect things to improve, particularly in the second half, from what we have experienced this year. But as we have indicated, we think the first quarter or two could be rough because -- for a lot of reasons, one of which is that we don’t know when deflation actually will turn. We also haven’t rounded fully the year when we had the price investments that we have made. Those are just some examples and we can’t predict where competition is going to be yet in the year either, so ordinarily we give the full-year guidance for 2010 in March, which we still plan to do. We did though want to give you an indication of what we saw ahead, so that you would have some way at least to bracket where the world is and that’s why we indicated that our -- both our sales and earnings per share we expect to be higher in 2010 than what we are projecting for 2009. 
Neil Currie - UBS: And the CapEx cut for over the next three years -- will you look to give that back to shareholders?
David B. Dillon: Mike. 
J. Michael Schlotman : Well, as I said, our use of free cash flow, that obviously will strengthen it and we will strike an appropriate balance between maintaining our triple B rating, which we think is important in this environment as well as returning to shareholders. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Thanks. Well, well done on the tonnage and unlucky on the margin. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolfe of BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Just on the increase in tonnage and you tied it into variable costs and that is how you run the business -- is it one for one? I mean, is your -- I assume it isn’t but could you give us a sense of how much hours or store labor hours you have to add for every increase in tonnage so we can do some sensitivity analysis around that?
J. Michael Schlotman : If you look -- every department is obviously different but if you look at it overall, it’s usually about 60% of our hours would be variable, 40% would be fixed. Now that would depend on where you start out on the volume of a store and the department of the store. But as a rough rule of thumb, that’s going to be pretty close. 
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, so we’re talking tens of millions of dollars per quarter with this kind of tonnage run-rate of increased variable costs against department contributions because the unit profits are down and aren’t that great -- I mean, is that sort of how the department P&L shake up?
J. Michael Schlotman : It would certainly be tens of millions. The other thing that would mitigate that to some extent is we continue to make process changes in our stores to improve productivity, and I said stores but we are doing the same thing in our manufacturing and our warehouses, continually looking at ways to do the same work more efficiently and effectively and that would mitigate some of that increase in hour needs. 
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Got it. And I just -- the other thing I wanted to ask about was as you looked at as of third quarter I think you indicated got tougher towards the end, particularly versus where you set guidance, was it more being forced by the consumer and how they are behaving and maybe more unexpected markdowns to clear out perishables and things like that? Or is it more out of the competitive environment when you have sort of gone back and done your post-mortem on where things are and how the quarter shook out?
David B. Dillon: Well, the post-mortem for me says that deflation was more pronounced from the -- when we had the last call to the present. Deflation was more pronounced than what we had expected it to be. I actually thought it was going to begin turning but I guess I was looking through rose-colored glasses, so that’s the first item.  Second is I think based on where the industry was seeing its sales, you saw a lot more reactions throughout the industry, more competitors and more geography with competitive reactions and that was -- I wasn’t surprised to see some of it but it was more widespread than I had expected. And those are the two biggest areas that I think we just didn’t see properly. With hindsight, we can see a little bit more clearly.  With deflated sales, particularly when we weren’t able to get a higher margin for it and in fact had a lower -- clearly a lower margin for it -- that doesn’t leave a lot of dollars to pay the bills and our bills came in in regular bills because the labor we have to spend is for the tonnage, not for the dollars. 
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay, and I just want to really follow-up on Neil’s question on the guidance, particularly when you add back the $0.08 swing, you know, the quarter clearly wasn’t nearly as bad as it looked, as the reported number on the core business ex fuel, which makes -- and I think I just look back and I think Q4 was pretty neutral on fuel last year, which really makes your numbers, your Q4 look pretty scary or pretty conservative and could you just give us sense of that -- are you saying what you are seeing lately and with Thanksgiving is just making you that cautious? Or are you trying to build in some kind of conservatism so you don’t surprise investors?
David B. Dillon: Well, I’m probably not going to -- in fact, I won't call it conservative as an estimate because I don’t think it is. I don’t think that’s an accurate description. I will tell you that it is more conservative relative to where we see our current forecast than it was when we gave it in the second quarter in September. At that time, we gave you a forecast that we believed to be accurate but it was pretty much right where we were seeing things. So we’ve built in a little bit of room for the fact that we got surprised on the downside and so we are expecting that that could easily happen this quarter, particularly with the very important holiday of Christmas ahead of us and given what happened in Thanksgiving, I’m not as bullish about where Christmas is going to come in for the industry and as a result, that doesn’t mean we are being conservative -- that means maybe that we are being realistic about the current environment. 
Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I would like to talk just a little bit about tonnage. I had the same sort of question when Safeway was talking about tonnage when they reported their third quarter numbers -- tonnage always goes up when perishable costs or prices go down. To the -- are you seeing more tonnage growth than you would have expected given the amount of deflation in those perishable categories?
David B. Dillon: You are correct that in categories like produce and certainly parts of, maybe not all of meat, when you have commodity costs go down, typically tonnage always goes up. That would be accurate. I don’t think that I felt this was just a reaction to what happened with commodity prices though and I would turn to maybe grocery as a good indication of that, is that our grocery tonnage was solid too. And while it had some deflation in it, as I’ve pointed out, I think that the tonnage growth that we are seeing is more a reflection of our customer. So look instead at the data that we get from our loyalty card -- we are growing the number of loyal households that we serve. Those loyal households are shopping more often with us, making more visits -- that’s not new news, that’s old news. They are buying more items in a month’s time -- that’s also the same news as we had last time. The only change that we are seeing in that is a positive change and in this quarter, the one we just finished, we are actually seeing the number of units they buy per visit of the loyal households has become flat. It’s no longer a decline. It was a decline the last several quarters on a per trip basis, but now on a per trip basis, they are actually buying more items -- not more, the same items as they bought the year ago, so I see that as it’s a small development but I see it as a positive development and I think it is reflective of our overall program is connecting well and producing the tonnage. Now if you had a sharp swing in the other direction on inflation, I think you would see some contraction in tonnage. The best example I can think of is milk. If milk costs go up, and we do expect that they will go up some -- in fact, they already have a little -- as milk costs go up and as retails go up, we do expect some of the gallonage to dissipate that we have gained. But we think that there’s still lots of tonnage out there to be had based on the combination of our strategy for connecting with our customer. 
J. Michael Schlotman : The only thing I would add on tonnage is it’s pretty broad-based -- it’s not just the perishable department, so if you look across the whole store, it’s pretty strong across the whole store. The only place there would be weaknesses are more things that are economic related in terms of discretionary type items -- if you look at seasonal items and some of those kinds of things would be where you would see the softer tonnage. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Thank you, and then a follow-on question with that -- when you look at the frequent shopper date, I know you have more households in general. Does the data show that people are buying more than just the promoted merchandise, that their baskets -- you know, that they are bringing you more of their total purchases, even if they are not what you would consider a really loyal customer?
David B. Dillon: That’s a hard one to answer because the market has gotten a little bit more promotional and as a result, the items that customers buy, their basket would be a little more promotional too. So I don’t know that I can answer it any different than that. We think our gains remain solid, even in the face of the promotional side of this, is how I think I would characterize it. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I guess I meant are you just getting people coming in and cherry picking you and that’s why households are up. 
David B. Dillon: Well, households are up but so are loyal households and loyal households require a household to be something more than a cherry picking customer. They actually have to buy with a combination of frequency and dollars over time to qualify for that description and that category is clearly growing. So that would not be a customer who comes in and buys just the featured item and leaves. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. When you think about the inflation outlook for dry grocery, we have almost nearly an entire year coming up, at least four quarters, of inflation to compare against -- is that right?
David B. Dillon: Three quarters would have -- if you take dairy out, I think that’s right. Rodney. 
W. Rodney McMullen : I was just going to say in the first quarter, wouldn’t expect to see much different than where we are today. In the second quarter, I think we will start seeing some categories changing. If you look at dairy, I think it will change sooner rather than later; if you look at other categories, I think it will probably -- a little later if you look at traditional grocery. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then my final question is about the impairment charge -- I try to remember, I was around a long time ago but I’m not sure my memory is very good, but I don’t believe that you had good will on your books for any other markets besides southern California and so you didn’t have to do the impairment test anywhere else but would it be fair to say that the impairment doesn’t mean that Southern California is necessarily worse than anywhere else?
David B. Dillon: Mike. 
J. Michael Schlotman : I’m not sure what you mean by not necessarily worse -- there are a lot of places where we do not have any good will. We still have over $1 billion of good will on our books, as you can see on the balance sheet, and it’s spread over a lot of different geographies. There is no more good will on the books for Ralphs. That has been entirely written off with the combination of what we wrote off at 04 and what we wrote off that we announced today.  I wouldn’t characterize it as any worse than anywhere -- you just don’t have to do a calculation like you do for when you have good will for other entities that don’t have it, and it’s the combination of factors that we spoke about -- the tough economy, the cautious consumers, the high unemployment, as well as just general market conditions. When you apply a multiple to a revised cash flow based on that environment yields you a value lower for the entity than you would have gotten at this time last year. 
W. Rodney McMullen : And the physical value of the assets clearly, clearly a decline in value in California. 
J. Michael Schlotman : Right. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Right. Okay. Thank you very much for answering my questions. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Whitmore of Cleveland Research.
Jason Whitmore - Cleveland Research: David, you talked briefly about making some adjustments -- I’m not sure if I picked up on what exactly those adjustments might be, whether they be near-term or moving into 2010 and I think maybe more broadly, have you thought differently about your business mode for the next couple of years, assuming that this value emphasis sticks with us for a while, or whether the macro or competitive environment remains stickier longer than expected. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, we’ve given a lot of thought to that, actually. First of all, I did not describe specifically what adjustments and for your thinking, you should think about as we look at our business, we are looking at adjustments in our gross margin and in our cost structure. But both of the areas that we are looking at are, I would characterize them as not significant changes, not radical changes, not big changes, not the kind of thing that you would see some difference in our numbers next week or next month but would help in our judgment would help make the current strategy where we are more affordable.  What we are not doing, if you go back to the closing comments I had right before we came to Q&A -- in fact, let me just read the sentences to you again because I think they are real important -- there are other changes we could have implemented that would have improved short-term results. But, in our judgment, they would have hampered our ability to grow market share, provide a good shopping experience for our customers and create value for our shareholders and opportunities for our associates. We did avoid and are continuing to avoid making significant changes, abrupt kind of short-term changes that probably five and 10 years ago we would have been more inclined to make. That doesn’t mean though we are going to stick our head in the sand and ignore what the operating environment is.  I think the biggest thing that I am watching for is the area of inflation and deflation. If we were to continue with a very deflationary environment, which is what I would think of as the current moment to be, I think we would have to re-ask ourselves what do we want to do on our price strategy and I think we’d have to push ourselves a little bit more on gross margin. But because we believe it is of more limited duration, we are holding the course a little bit more straight than we might have done if we thought it was a more permanent change in the economy. I don’t know that I can spell it out any clearer than that. 
Jason Whitmore - Cleveland Research: That’s helpful. I think -- I was curious within -- regardless of the competitive environment, which obviously has changed in the last three to six months, do you think all in for 2009, it’s been a year of learning at how to re-establish or define value within your product offerings or within your stores? Not just private label but opening price points and all in with the basket, which seems to be where the greatest amount of pressure has been. And I don’t know if that’s baseline or the promo mix or just all that sort of noise from all the deals that have shown up in the channel, some supplier driven, some retailer driven -- but is that mix getting re-evaluated all-in, is that what you are talking about with gross margin?
David B. Dillon: I think we have done a really good job of evaluating how to create value for our customers in this environment and we started doing that actually a couple of years ago but it became very strong in late 2008 and in the beginning of 2009 and I actually think it’s because we’ve done a good job on that point, I think that’s one of the reasons that our identical sales are positive and that our tonnage is strong. There’s not many retailers, food retailers out there who can say that and we think we can say it because of the things we did actually some time ago on exactly the points you are making. That value proposition and the combination of what are the right items, what are the right prices, what is the right promotional strategy, and it’s not a fixed target. It’s a moving target as you go through each month and see how the customer is reacting and changing and what the competitive environment is but on that, I would give us pretty good marks. I think we’ve done a good job there. 
Jason Whitmore - Cleveland Research: And to follow-up on your expense or cost structure comment, has that moved up in priority or urgency internally to help find other ways to offset some of this pressure?
David B. Dillon: Yes, one of our longer term disappointments right now is that we have not yet found as many process changes that produce large dollars and implemented those changes as we had hoped we would have. We found a lot of the opportunities but we’ve not been able to turn it into actual dollars as much as we had expected and it is an important part of our strategy going forward. We are not giving up on that point. We are pressing ahead and pushing that point even harder because we believe that we can make some permanent reductions in some of our costs through process change in ways the customers won't feel abandoned and it won't be short-term and it will make more affordable the strategies that we have in mind. And that is a disappointment for this year but it’s a long-term disappointment. It’s not something that I can say today we are going to change and you will see a difference next week or next month or even frankly next quarter. We hope you will see some changes next year. We are pushing ourselves hard to make that true because that is an important part of our strategy. 
Jason Whitmore - Cleveland Research: Great. Thank you much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: First, sort of a macro question -- when you are talking about deflation, is it tied up with trading down? I mean, how easy is it to tease those things apart because it seems to me the consumer is buying very often at the lower end of a category’s price point range and so you are buying in lower price point merchandise. 
W. Rodney McMullen : If you look at the way we are estimating our deflation, it would not be as much because it’s more looking at the price of what we are paying and selling product for. If you look at individual cost per item, the deflation number would be significantly more than that 0.8%. So if you look at for an identical item that customers are -- if you looking at what’s within each basket that customers are buying, that average price per item is significantly more deflationary than the 0.8% is. And that we are not reflecting in the 0.8.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Gotcha, so the -- I don’t know, a mix adjusted rate of deflation would be significantly greater than the 0.8%, to paraphrase what you just mentioned, Rodney?
W. Rodney McMullen : Right, yes. That would be our estimate. I mean, you know, obviously you could get a PHD before you know for sure, but that would be our estimate, or our expectation. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Okay. Thank you. Mike, when you look at the CapEx budget contraction over the next three years, how fast does that drop? You know, you divide a billion by three, you get $333 million a year but is it more back-end loaded or can you cut projects faster? How should we look at that?
J. Michael Schlotman : Well, we are certainly looking at 2010 as we speak but we are not in the mode of wanting to spend a dime to save a quarter. By paying something to delay a project or incurring a penalty to delay a project, we just don’t think that would be prudent at this point. So we are looking at 2010 and trying to make sure projects that are -- we are legally committed to, we don’t do anything to incur a big penalty or a big charge as a result of it. But we are trying to moderate the program in not just 11 and 10 but -- or not just 11 and 12 but 2010 as well. 
W. Rodney McMullen : It will be more back-end loaded though. 
J. Michael Schlotman : We would certainly expect 11 reduction to be more than 10 and 12 to be more than 11, but 10 will still be meaningful. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right. When you look at what you describe as loyal households, what percent of Kroger sales do they generate?
W. Rodney McMullen : That’s one where -- it’s a good question. I’m not sure that we would want to answer that one because that one is pretty proprietary. But it’s a meaningful number is about all I can really say, Chuck. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Okay. And did you give us an actual number for your ticket and traffic in the quarter? If you did, I missed it. 
J. Michael Schlotman : We did not. If you look at it the way we historically measure it, traffic would have been more than 100% of our sales growth. Average basket would have actually been a decline. And if you’ll remember in the prepared comments, we talked about it relative to households versus each -- you know, the transactions themselves. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right. And again, back to this whole pricing and deflation question, is a pick-up then in -- well, a reduction in deflation, some movement towards flat pricing or even inflation, how much does that help you if the consumer is buying carefully and buying at the lower price points within a category?
David B. Dillon:  Well, it obviously depends on what items change and that is the whole ballgame anyway -- I mean, that’s true even on deflation. Some items that change are harder to move in a market and others are not, so I think it’s -- the proof is ultimately in what the customer does. I don’t know that there is any better answer. 
W. Rodney McMullen : The only other thing I would add is at some -- if you look in the second quarter, we start cycling some of the significant deflation from the current year. So you don’t have that headwind that we are going against. Now, the mix change can go either way because if the economy improves a little bit, customers could also start trading up a little bit too. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: That is what it sounds like -- the economy is your biggest challenge right now and it’s almost a waiting game for the stronger players. 
David B. Dillon: Yes. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right. Gentlemen, thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Muschkin of Jefferies & Company.
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: I want to kind of hit on some points people asked before but just to Rodney, I think you said that the supermarkets trail the economy by about six to 12 months. I actually concur with that. So as we look at next year, clearly this quarter was really tough but as we look at next year, it looks like we have employment inflecting, it looks like food at home sales actually already inflected real, and it looks like inflation is inflecting probably by the second quarter. So if I listen to what you guys are saying, how you are really focusing on the expenses, it looks like we could enter a period with Kroger growing EBITDA dollars faster than sales sometime next year. I was wondering if you had any comments on that. I know that’s been something that’s been hard for you guys but if we enter that period, do you think it could last for a while?
W. Rodney McMullen : Well, to me it’s one of those where as we gave the guidance that Dave talked about, what we are assuming is the world stays kind of where -- what we see today. To the extent that it gets better, that would be obviously the up-side. To the extent that it would be worse would be the other side.  To commit today on your number, I wouldn’t necessarily commit to it today. It will be something when we normally give more description on the 2010 guidance in March we will do that, but I wouldn’t want to commit to that at this point because I still think -- you know, one of the reasons why the range is so wide that we gave for the fourth quarter, there’s still an awful lot of uncertainty and an awful lot of moving parts out there and I think it’s too early to say those moving parts have stopped. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: But Rodney, if I can maybe jump in and do a follow-up there, I mean, we’ve talked about in the past EBITDA dollar growth not really keeping up with sales growth. Is it -- as you guys look at the customer first strategy and look past this economic kind of abyss that we entered about a year ago, is it the idea that you really want to get those EBITDA dollars growing faster than revenues?
W. Rodney McMullen : Well, if you look, our long-term strategy is to have slightly improving operating margins and in order to have slightly improving operating margins would take EBITDA dollar growth slightly in excess of our sales growth. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: And then I guess I just have one other question -- and it goes to your -- if I look at your, for your best customers that have a Kroger credit card, receiver your mailers, buy all your gas with you guys, it’s unclear to me that you are actually even priced above Walmart when you put all those factors in. And I guess my thought is do you think that’s right, number one? And if yes, do you think you are able to communicate this well enough with your customers because your tonnage growth is great but if it’s that much of a value, maybe you could argue it should be even more? 
David B. Dillon: I would answer yes and yes. I really believe that that’s a correct statement, is that our customers, our very best customers, see the combination of what we offer and they like it, even from just a cost or a price point of view, they like it better than what others offer. But I also would add that they like our storage better too, in addition to the pricing position. 
W. Rodney McMullen : You know, when we do research, clearly customers rate us very highly on our people, shopping experience, and products and our best customers, our advocates would understand the price value they are getting and that’s the reason why they love us so much and it is our responsibility to make sure every time a new customer comes in that they can see that total value, because that’s what’s in it for all of us for the long-term. And that’s what we are really focused on doing. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: So do you think the message is good enough for new customers though? I mean, it seems to me that people would be coming to you in droves if it’s yes and yes to those two -- you know, yes to the answer that you are just as good a value, maybe even a little better than Walmart. It seems like that would create a huge amount of growth in market share if communicated optimally. 
David B. Dillon: Therein lies our opportunity. 
W. Rodney McMullen : And when you ask me, on anything, I’m never going to say that it’s good enough, so that’s just -- I think all of us are that way. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: All right. That’s all I have for you guys. Thanks for taking my questions. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kim [Gale] of [inaudible] Investments. 
David B. Dillon: Kim, are you there?
Kim Gale - Analyst : A couple of questions -- a technical question on the impairment. My understanding was that it was -- impairments are typically taken for a permanent loss of value and you talked about the cycle and things being somewhat temporarily depressed, so I was wondering if you could amplify it a bit on that.  Secondly and perhaps more core to the strategy, I’m wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of elasticity of demand? Clearly people want to save money and price is very important but I’m wondering if you are seeing the kind of results from price investment now that -- you know, the kind of results, if you can compare them to what you are seeing now versus what you might have seen a couple of years ago. 
David B. Dillon: Mike, do you want to comment?
J. Michael Schlotman : On the impairment, there’s really -- the literature doesn’t allow you a lot of flexibility on looking at an aberration in the market today. There’s a little bit of flexibility of looking at market valuations today compared to the historic valuations but you certainly aren’t going to sit here today and assume you are going to get back to the historic highs of market valuations as well and just with where the economy is in southern California, the unemployment in Southern California and the effect that is having on the consumers in Southern California adjusted for maybe not current market valuations but not overly robust market valuations either. It just wound up being a trigger event in the quarter that caused us to have the need to write the good will off. 
David B. Dillon: Let me answer the last half of your question about elasticity of demand. I think we are seeing more reaction to our pricing programs, both regular price that is everyday shelf price and also promotional prices and I think that’s a result of the customer becoming more sensitized to pricing in this environment and in this situation. So the customer wants it, is reacting more -- that’s one of the reasons we pointed out that the pricing program we put in place earlier in the year or the pricing programs, plural, that we put in place earlier in the year that we felt we got a stronger reaction than we had actually expected based on the past. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : I mean, it’s clearly a tough quarter and the deflation throws sort of a monkey wrench into all of this but just looking at gross profit per foot, this is the first down quarter I’ve seen in a very long time -- you know, 53 week years, 52 versus 53 week years accepted, so -- and you clearly talked a little bit about not wanting to react on the short-term versus your long-term thinking but I guess I can read into your answer there then that you certainly think that there is still more to be gained from price investment and that that should while perhaps depressing margins result in higher gross profit per foot over time?
David B. Dillon: Well, we definitely think there is more room for us from a pricing perspective, but we also are moderating that view and balancing that view with our ability to pay for it. We think that’s important.  As for shrinking gross profit per square foot or other ways you might want to measure it, we hope that this quarter and the quarter we are in now and perhaps another quarter or two are aberrations in that regard. We do not expect that to be a permanent part of our strategy. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : Okay. And then maybe just amplifying a little bit on Chuck’s questions, could you just go through a little bit of the methodology that you use to calculate your deflation number? Because it sounds -- I don’t know if it’s sales weighted or if it’s like an even weighting of items or exactly how you do that but that might be helpful. 
J. Michael Schlotman : It’s in the categories -- it’s the cost of what we are buying the item for this year compared to the cost of what we are buying the item for in the two-year period compared, combined. And then it’s weighted by the velocity of those going out the door. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : So it’s based on your cost then, so it doesn’t take into account your actual selling price?
J. Michael Schlotman : No, it’s cost and the velocity of the tonnage going out the front door -- it does not take into account the price. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : So to the extent that you are sharper in price this year versus last year, your deflation could well be quite a bit worse than that number?
J. Michael Schlotman : Sales deflation would be, but not product cost deflation. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : Right, but I’m thinking sales, just from a top line perspective. 
J. Michael Schlotman : Sales could be deflated by more than our product cost deflation as a result of that, yes. 
Kim Gale - Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Kim. I think we have time for a couple more questions. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: I just want to ask you -- have your comps, at least in your mind, stabilized here? And I ask that question because you talk about Q4 IDs being the same as Q3, yet Q3 decelerated for most of the quarter, which would imply that maybe the first four weeks are better than call it the last four weeks of Q3. Your basket is flat, deflation at least looks like it’s maybe peaked so I was wondering if you could comment on that?
David B. Dillon: I think you’ve sized it up pretty correctly -- about the only exception in the four weeks we’ve had so far would be Thanksgiving was softer than what we would have liked, because when I made the comment about our [ident] sales now are about similar to or par with where we were in the third quarter, that’s where we were for the whole third quarter, which would be a little higher number than where we were in some of those later weeks. So I think that’s accurate.  I don’t know that I can predict though whether this is really the bottom or not. And I’d have to say that it does play a little bit on our heads because we are not used to seeing, particularly in the last three, four years, we are not used to seeing numbers that are quite this small on our identical growth. So we’ve tried to look a lot more at our household growth and our tonnage growth to really see what’s the health of our business, and because we think it’s strongly healthy, I’m willing to get past some of these low ID numbers and -- so I’m hopeful that it’s sort of at the bottom but I don’t know that I can judge that for sure. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. But your fourth quarter of last year I believe decelerated through a lot of the quarter, right, because holiday was fairly difficult last year -- is that right?
David B. Dillon: I think that’s right. I believe that’s accurate. Our IDs that quarter were 3.8 for the quarter -- I don’t remember exactly how it fell through the quarter but I believe that’s accurate. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: All right. And then there’s been a lot of talk on the call about tonnage growth and tonnage growth is great but the gross margin is down over 100 basis points and I don’t think investors are going to give you credit for that unless you prove that you can keep it. So what is your confidence that the volumes that you are driving today as it relates to investment in price, you are going to be able to keep once we come out of this?
David B. Dillon: Well, it’s a hard question to answer but we believe that because we are connecting with the customer and not just buying them through hot promotions and having them come in and cherry-pick us, that we believe that that connection over time will produce somewhat consistency in our tonnage and our business with them.  Now obviously as inflation comes into play, some tonnage will dissipate. One question often you all have asked is on Kroger Brands, when all this changes, the economy is better, what do we expect Kroger Brands to be? Well, I don’t really expect it to be 35% of the units sold in grocery but I also don’t expect it to fall back to our old levels. And if you go back just a year or so ago, that old level was down around 32% and so I think some of this gain is permanent but not all of it, and I think some of the tonnage gain is permanent but not all of it. And the biggest issue for us is market share and the connection with the customer as we measure our loyal households and I expect that to be solid going forward and our strategy is intended to try to keep it that way. 
W. Rodney McMullen : I’d only add one thing to Dave’s point -- the other thing, as you know, every quarter we measure how we perform with several thousand customers on how we are doing on delivering our basic services and customers continue to tell us that we are improving on the way our associates are treating our customers, that shopping experience and speed of checkout and some of those attributes, we continue to get better on those both on an absolute basis compared to us but also a relative comparison versus our competitors. And to me, that’s the other reason why I would add on top of what Dave said that gives us confidence that it is something that we can keep and maintain and grow from when the economy improves. 
David B. Dillon: That’s a good point. I would agree with that. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Could you help us understand where the competition is coming from, Dave? Is it regional guys, is it national guys? Walmart’s clearly made a lot of noise about getting more aggressive on price. I’m not sure if you are seeing it on the ground or not but does that play a role?
David B. Dillon: We generally don’t talk about specific competitors but let me just give you four examples -- it would include of course Walmart, because you described that and that’s certainly accurate and that’s widespread; it would include Safeway, who has announced what they are doing; it would include Albertson’s, both sets of Albertsons’; it would include local and regional operators like Giant Eagle and HEB; and Meier, and all of those are illustrations of that it’s been more competitors and it’s more geography. And there are others too but those would be good examples, good illustrations. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: All right, and then one last question for you hear on share repurchase -- I’m looking at the cash flow statement and you bought back about $130 million in stock year-to-date. Last year it’s over $600 million and I know you want to keep the rating and you’ve had concerns about the credit markets and a revolver but your stock is also $20. You are talking about the fact that you do think earnings will improve next year -- it would seem like now is the time to buy. So I was just wondering what your thoughts are on that. 
J. Michael Schlotman : Well, as we said earlier, we are going to continue to balance the use of our cash flow to maintain our credit rating and give value back to the shareholders and that would be one opportunity to do it but we are not going to commit to exactly in what form that will take. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you. 
David B. Dillon: But we would agree with you that based on all those circumstances, it looks like a good time to buy, so all those of you listening, [I would pay attention to that].  Thank you. Next question. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things -- 
David B. Dillon: And John, you are going to be the last question, I think. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. It looks like vendor allowances have stepped up over the last six months, both food and non-food. Have you guys seen that as well and does that go higher from here?
David B. Dillon: Well, vendors are responding in lots of different ways. They are lowing some list cost and they are doing more promotional money and all of that to try to keep things moving. That’s pretty consistent with what we saw last quarter too. I think that’s one of the reasons you are seeing deflation in grocery is that you are seeing overall the costs of the products coming down and so yeah, I think that’s true. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Now, should that be helpful to gross margin or no, as you supplement your investments with vendor spending?
David B. Dillon: It depends completely on the items. Some items are so competitive that it almost doesn’t matter too much what the cost is because we got to have the right retail. Other items that are not as sensitive if we see a decline there, that actually should help gross margin a little and so we think in a deflationary environment, some items actually do help us but they didn’t help us enough to offset the ones that didn’t help us this last time. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right, and where are we now on SKU rationalization and how do you attack that in 2010? You would think that would be a priority, a way to maybe get cost down and get sharper on items that matter most. Is that going to accelerate in 2010?
W. Rodney McMullen : I wouldn’t necessarily say that it would accelerate. Assortment has been something that we worked with Dunnhumby on over the last couple of years and through that whole period of time, we’ve had pretty meaningful change in the SKU rationalization, and making sure that it’s store specific. That’s something that I think we will constantly have a debate in terms of how to improve and how to make sure we have what the customer wants. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right, and then you look at the pressure you are under. Obviously there’s a lot of companies out there without your scale and without your comp momentum. You know, do you guys have a sense -- I mean, it’s hard to tell but you wouldn’t think that there would be a lot of dry powder for folks going into 2010, that there might be some moderation in the competitive environment. What’s your sense of that?
David B. Dillon: I don’t think I can comment on that very well, but I think you’ve assessed it pretty well. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then as you guys look at 2010, what’s your best guess when -- do you have a sense when we go from deflation to inflation? Mid-year?
W. Rodney McMullen : I would expect probably mid-year. I would expect in the second quarter for some categories we’ll begin to see it as we move through that quarter. But I think in terms of looking at us overall, I think mid-year is a good point to use. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right, and your 2010, the comments you made about 2010, just so we are clear, you expect to comp better than 2% to 2.5% and you expect some level of earnings growth?
W. Rodney McMullen : Correct. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. We don’t yet know -- I guess -- if you look at the old model of a slight improvement in EBIT margin, and I think we always worked off of maybe a 3.4 EBIT margin for that number, you know, have we reset the bar to something lower than that or -- so we are working off of that new number or we don’t know yet?
W. Rodney McMullen : I don’t think at this point we would be ready to give that kind of detail. 
J. Michael Schlotman : We’ll give further guidance in March. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. All right, thanks. 
David B. Dillon: John, thank you. We know it’s been a long call. We hope it’s helpful but before we sign off, I would like to share just a few additional thoughts for our associates who are listening in. As you heard, our third quarter performance was not as robust as we had hoped it would be. It is clear the operating environment continues to present challenges, some new and some we’ve already faced. The economy will continue to put pressure on our customers and our organization. We know the challenges ahead and we recognize the opportunities as well. Your individual -- your personal individual connections with our customers during this important holiday season will help strengthen our position into 2010. We appreciate your dedication and hard work as we focus on delivering the best experience for our customers. We wish you and each of you a wonderful holiday season with your family and friends. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays. That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2009 Kroger Company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one topic with one question, and a follow-up question if necessary. Thank you.  I will now turn the call over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Carin and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2009 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Don McGeorge, and Mike Schlotman.  As many of you know, Don announced his decision to retire earlier this year and will remain with us in an advisory capacity for the next few months. Rodney was named President and Chief Operating Officer effective August 1st. In a few minutes, Rodney will offer details on certain aspects of our performance during the quarter and then Mike will provide details on the financial elements we report.  First I will start with an overview of the current environment. We are pleased with our performance this quarter as it aligns with our long-term strategy of winning households for life, making Kroger a stronger retailer now and in the future. Our customers are increasingly turning to Kroger's family of stores to meet even more of their everyday household needs. As a result, our customer focus strategy is generating and will continue to generate solid long-term value for Kroger's shareholders.  Identical supermarket sales increased 2.6% in the second quarter without fuel. This is a solid increase, particularly considering changes in customer behavior and significant deflation in produce and dairy. In fact, our product cost inflation estimate excluding fuel dropped to a negative 0.2% from the positive 3.6% we estimated in the first quarter. The increase in identical supermarket sales also signals that more customers are turning to Kroger to consolidate purchases, driving the exceptional unit growth we saw in the quarter. In fact, this quarter -- this is a quarter where we believe our identical sales results do not fully reflect the strength of our business. Our comments today should give you some additional perspective. Growth in the number of loyal households we serve is just one example. Loyal households represents our very best customers and during the second quarter, our data shows a strong increase in the number of loyal households that shop our stores. Our data also indicates that these customers are making more trips to our stores and buying fewer items per trip, yet in the course of a month, these households are buying more total items from Kroger than they were a year ago, which indicates that they are consolidating more of their total spend with us.  In addition to deflation and changes in customer behavior, two other factors influenced Kroger's results in the quarter -- planned investments and competition. As a result of all of these factors, gross margin declined more than expected. Rodney will share details on each of these factors with you shortly but first I want to update you on Kroger's exceptional tonnage growth and discuss guidance for the remainder of the year.  Our overall tonnage growth in grocery increased at almost double the rate we experienced in the first quarter. Strong corporate brand sales drove overall tonnage growth in grocery, just as it has for the past two quarters. We also saw tonnage growth in national brand products. This is a trend change from the past three quarters where we’d seen declines in national brand unit sales.  We experienced very strong tonnage growth, particularly in dairy, meat, and produce as customers responded positively to lower costs and better pricing. I want to thank our associates in our plants, warehouses, and stores for doing an outstanding job keeping up with the tremendous volume growth we’re generating. Keep up the great work.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we have confirmed our full-year identical supermarket sales guidance of 3% to 4% without fuel for fiscal 2009. This guidance assumes product costs for the remainder of fiscal 2009 are consistent with or slightly lower than they were in the second half of fiscal 2008. We have revised our 2009 earnings per share guidance to reflect continued changes in customer behavior and an uncertain operating environment. We now expect full year fiscal 2009 earnings of $1.90 to $2.00 per diluted share. This is a wider range than our previous guidance of $2.00 to $2.05 per diluted share because of the uncertain economic environment and the subsequent caution on the part of customers.  In the short term, there are several factors influencing our business that caused us to change our original projections. These factors may continue to influence Kroger's financial results for the remainder of the year and will help determine where in the earnings guidance range we end the year. Scenarios that would lead to earnings per share at the high end of the range include improvement in customer sentiment that leads to a sales mix change which could enhance Kroger's gross margin; moderating inflation in produce and dairy; a lessening of competitive or promotional activity in key markets; and stronger margins in our retail fuel business than we had -- than we currently anticipate.  The reverse of these scenarios could lead to a result at the lower end of the guidance range. Despite the challenging operating environment, we remain on our plan and we are confident our approach and the investments we are making will continue to make -- and we will continue to make Kroger a stronger retailer now and in the future.  Now I will turn to Rodney who will discuss other aspects of our performance during the quarter. Rodney. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. The Kroger team produced solid results in the second quarter. As Dave said, four primary factors influenced our results this quarter -- one, deflation; two, changes in customer behavior; three, planned investments that were part of our original plan; and four, competition. I want to take a few moments to discuss each of these factors with you, beginning with deflation.  In general, we can grow our business in an inflationary or deflationary environment but sudden deflation in a highly competitive market can lead to retail prices and product costs that drop quickly, creating lower margins. This was the case in the second quarter in categories like milk and produce, where we experienced significant deflation, we certainly sold more units. But lower retail prices and profit per unit pressured our second quarter results. And for the first time in several quarters, we began to see deflation in most grocery categories.  The second was changes in customer behavior. We continue to experience changes in customer behavior during the quarter. Consistent with the past two quarters, customers are buying more of what they need and less of what they want. The most prevalent trend this quarter was the willingness of customers to switch within a product category. For some customers, it meant switching from one national brand to another lower priced national brand. For other customers, it meant trying a Kroger brand or switching to our value brand. Our corporate brands continued to enjoy exceptional growth -- in fact, this continued to have double-digit growth in units this quarter versus last year.  Corporate brands now represents 26% of our grocery sales dollars and 35% of our grocery units sold. This is almost 200 basis points higher than their unit share in the same quarter of last year.  Another trend we are seeing is in food stamps and other benefits. Government data indicates an increase in these benefits due to the economy. At Kroger, we are seeing an even sharper increase in our sales from customers using food stamps. While all of these changes in customer behavior can adversely affect Kroger's sales and profitability in the short-term, they do benefit us in the long-term because it keeps customers in that category and in our stores.  As part of our overall strategy, we plan our price investments strategically and make decisions based on our deep insight into customer behavior through our partnership with dunnhumby. This is a competitive advantage for Kroger. As a result of our insight, we have moved some planned investments up and delay others based on the competitive market and customer behavior as we did during the quarter.  The competitive landscape also changed during the quarter. While our industry has always been competitive, we did see heightened activity in more markets than we typically do. This is not surprising because customers are spending less and retailers are aggressively competing for their dollars.  We continue to enhance Kroger's strong competitive position in this environment. Our positive identical supermarket sales results and strong tonnage growth demonstrate our ability to continue to gain market share in all economic environments.  As part of our customer focused culture, we deliver value in a number of ways through our people, products, prices, and the overall shopping experience in our family of stores. Additionally, our fuel rewards program continues to reward our most loyal shoppers through discounts on fuel earned through their purchases inside our supermarkets. No other U.S. grocery retailer can currently replicate the value proposition we offer. Customers’ response to our programs and initiatives continues to be overwhelmingly positive. Through these types of investments, our customers have saved $1.5 billion in the past year.  Now let’s turn to labor relations. Last month our associates in Dayton, Ohio ratified a new agreement. Negotiations continue in Atlanta, Arizona, and Portland and we have contract extensions in all three markets. In Colorado, our efforts at the bargaining table have not produced an agreement. We have made a balanced strong offer for a new contract there and we expect it will be in the hands of our associates to vote soon. We are hopeful that our associates will approve the offer without a work stoppage.  In Dallas, the contract for our store associates expire later this year. In addition to the normal pressures on our business, rising healthcare costs and under-funded pension plans will have to play out at the bargaining table. Still, we continue to be a destination employer that is hiring and promoting associates in this tough economic climate and offering high quality affordable healthcare for associates and their families.  Now Mike will offer additional color on the quarter. Mike. 
J. Michael Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. I will review several aspects of Kroger's second quarter performance, beginning with net earnings. Kroger's second quarter net earnings were $254.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings of $276.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the same period last year. We estimate that our retail fuel operations added a penny less to second quarter earnings per share this year compared to the prior year. I will cover retail fuel operations in a few minutes but first let’s review key financial metrics of our core supermarket business. Let’s start with gross margin.  As many of you know, we use a term internally to measure the difference between the retail price that a customer pays for a product in one of our stores and the cost we pay to procure that product from the supplier. This term is supermarket selling gross margin and it declined 88 basis points during the second quarter excluding our retail fuel operations. This declined significantly larger than our average investment over the past several quarters. It reflects the planned investments that Rodney described for you. It also reflects the unplanned factors he described, including the impact of sales mix changes, some heightened competitive activity, plus produce and dairy deflation that has been deeper and more sustained than we anticipated. These are temporary factors. As they normalize, we would expect Kroger's selling gross margin investment to normalize as well.  Kroger's FIFO gross margin excluding our retail fuel operations decreased 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The difference between Kroger's FIFO gross margin and supermarket selling gross margin is primarily the operating costs that are embedded in our FIFO gross margin. These operating costs include shrink, warehousing, transportation, and advertising expenses. During the quarter, we achieved meaningful improvement as the rate of sales in all these areas. We were particularly gratified to see improvement in logistic costs given the significant tonnage increase handled by associates in our distribution system to service the additional customer demand in our stores.  Turning now to LIFO, we recorded a $14.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter, a decrease of $31.5 million from the prior year. We now anticipate a full-year LIFO charge of $70 million for fiscal 2009. This estimate is based on our forecast of 1% to 2% inflation for the year. This particular inflation forecast is based on cost changes for products in our inventory and is used for our LIFO calculation. The LIFO calculation does not consider the velocity at which a product moves -- only how many units of an item are in inventory and the year-over-year change in the items’ cost. When Dave referenced 20 basis points of product cost deflation relative to sales, that calculation does consider the velocity of product movement.  Turning now to operating, general, and administrative expenses, Kroger's OG&A rate excluding retail fuel operations decreased 7 basis points compared with the same period last year. This decline reflects strong cost controls, lower incentive compensation, and our ongoing efforts to control utility costs through several of our efficiency initiatives. We also enjoyed some relief in expenses tied to petroleum costs. For example, the plastic shopping bags provided in our stores.  We are very pleased by this OG&A performance. Achieving OG&A leverage is particularly challenging in an environment of declining retail prices and higher unit sales and we appreciate the progress our team made in this important area. We continue to see opportunities for additional operating cost savings, which will be important as we face ongoing cost pressures in pension, healthcare, and credit card fees.  Kroger's long-term objective is to balance cost savings with investments. While we did not meet that objective this quarter, we believe the period was a short-term anomaly. Total operating costs did decline and we were pleased with the direction, especially considering the deflation on the top line and strong unit growth. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, Kroger's operating margin excluding our retail fuel operations and the benefit of a lower LIFO charge decreased 17 basis points. On this basis, we now expect a slight decline in Kroger's operating margin for the year.  Let’s now turn to Kroger's retail fuel operations. Kroger now operates more than 800 supermarket fuel centers and about 700 of our convenience stores sell fuel. Gasoline is an important part of Kroger's one-stop shopping strategy, allowing us to offer a convenient service at a great value to our loyal customers. Customers continue to respond well to our fuel offering. During the quarter, we sold more fuel gallons, both on an absolute and identical basis.  In the second quarter, the cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers was $0.136 compared to $0.179 for the same period last year. Because of the margin volatility inherent in selling large volumes of fuel, we always encourage investors to take a longer view of this part of our business.  On a rolling four quarters basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.133 this year compared to $0.12 for the same period a year ago. Please keep in mind that the fuel margins we realized in fiscal 2008, particularly in the second and third quarters, were exceptionally strong. Our expectations for the current fiscal year are based on a more normalized fuel margin of $0.11 per gallon.  Now I would like to update you on Kroger's financial strategy, beginning with capital investment. We continue to view the current environment as an opportunity to improve Kroger's store base and overall operations. We believe capital investment is important for the continued growth of our business as it positions Kroger as an even stronger retailer in the future and we continue to see returns above our hurdle rate. For the second quarter, capital investment excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities totaled $518 million compared to $461.1 million in the prior year. On this basis through the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, we have invested $1.1 billion. We continue to project 2009 capital spending of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities.  During the first two quarters of the year, we spent $115.3 million to purchase some of our leased properties at very attractive rates. This included several retail stores and one distribution center.  We expect additional real estate opportunities to come our way and we have the financial strength to be able to take advantage of them.  Net total debt was $7.3 billion, a decrease of $198.5 million from a year ago. On a rolling four quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.78 compared with 1.90 during the same period last year. We expect to continue to improve Kroger's debt coverages on a year-over-year basis.  While Kroger's bias towards debt reduction remains in the current environment, we have continued to make some share repurchases. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.8 million shares of stock at an average price of $21.58 per share for a total investment of $60.1 million. At the end of the quarter, $425 million remained under our current stock repurchase authorization.  Also during the quarter, Kroger returned $59 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividend payments. We believe Kroger's quarterly cash dividend, which currently yields over 1%, is one way that our customer first strategy rewards shareholders.  Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Mike. As you can hear from our comments today, we remain on our plan. Our approach and the investments we are making continue to strengthen Kroger today and position us well for future growth.  It may seem counter-intuitive to hear me so optimistic in such an uncertain environment but based on what I am seeing first hand in our stores, I am enthusiastic about the can-do selling passion our associates have embraced and our customers tell us that they see it too. That’s why customers are choosing to spend more time and more money in Kroger's family of stores. If you haven’t visited one of our stores in a while, I encourage you to do so. There is an excitement and an energy among our associates that is inviting and is really fun to see. They are doing an outstanding job and that’s why Kroger's future is so promising.  And with that, we’d now be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great. Thanks so much and thanks for all the color on the call today. You talked about some of the change in consumer behavior in your loyal households. Can you also talk about what you are seeing from the rest of your customer base as well?
David B. Dillon: Well, we’re seeing a couple of things that might be of interest to you. The consumers throughout the U.S. obviously are going through a lot of trauma and so we are seeing a change in the customer behavior in our store a little bit. For instance, the end of the month selling is noticeably at lower levels than what it used to be so it’s more impacted. We saw that through this last quarter and we actually saw earlier signs of it before but I think it’s even more clear now.  I think it also tells you a little bit about consumer behavior when we indicated that among our very best customers that while we’re getting -- that we’re growing the number of households that are counted as our best customers and those folks are shopping with us more often, that’s a little counter intuitive too and they are buying fewer items when they shop more often. That’s also a little counter-intuitive. But the picture as we see it is people are spending money when they need to -- that is for meals for the day or for the week, but they are only spending what they need to and then they are having to come back a little bit more often. By coming back a little more often and because they’ve consolidated purchases with us, we are seeing a higher unit purchase per household over the course of a month.  So I think that’s -- it’s good news for us but it’s a pretty clear picture that the consumers around the U.S. and the customers at Kroger are experiencing some trauma in this environment. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, and then in terms of a follow-up question, obviously you are gaining market share. Are there certain categories where you are gaining more share or is it pretty widespread throughout the store?
David B. Dillon: Well, it’s really widespread. Let me just give you a little more color on the departments in our ID sales. Our strongest departments were in meat, deli, bakery, grocery and nutrition. All of those were clearly above the average. General merchandise continued to be a little soft, mostly the discretionary areas but it is slightly improving in the trend from where it was before. And produce of course is negative but that is all driven by the deflation experienced in the category. So on the whole, we feel like we are growing share pretty broad-based.  And actually, it’s pretty broad-based across our divisions too. We did have in the quarter we had two divisions that had negative ID sales. Those divisions though were negative less than 1% negative, so just barely negative. We had two that were flat and the rest were positive so that’s pretty widespread as well, so hopefully that will help you a little. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great. Thanks so much and best of luck. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Canaccord Adams.
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: I think the numbers make a pretty clear statement that Kroger is going to maintain its pricing advantage in the marketplace and given your scale, probably best positioned to handle it. But your competition has to be feeling more pain than you are and I know you might not have lived through a past cycle like this one but how -- in your best guess, how long do you think this could last for and are different channels important in the equation this time?
David B. Dillon: Well, I don’t think there’s been a cycle like this one before, at least not that I would have experienced. It’s hard to predict, obviously, how long this will last and you can follow the economists and get their sense but my sense is a while longer. I realize that doesn’t help you very much but we are actually, as you can tell, pretty optimistic. We saw signs last quarter in the tonnage growth, and you’ve never heard me before, I don’t think, say that our sales were better than the identical sales that we actually reported but they were.  To give you a little perspective on that just for a second is if you look at the tonnage and look at our produce and dairy sales and try to adjust -- in other words, take the movement we experienced but take the deflation that we experienced out of it, you’d see almost an increase of roughly 200 basis points in our ID sales. I mean, that’s remarkable.  And so actually you’d say I think in those numbers that Kroger saw some recovery in sales last quarter but it doesn’t really show in the numbers because of so much deflation. So I’d watch for when the commodities begin to change, when the deflation subsides a little, and I would think a couple of quarters but it’s still out there. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: And the -- 
David B. Dillon: -- might want to add to that. 
Unidentified Participant:  Well, I was just going to say -- you know, from an economy standpoint, we’re doing our planning with the assumption that it will be slow for a while but it will continue to get slightly improved from where we are today. As Dave talked about deflation, we certainly think deflation is possible for the next couple of quarters but not as bad as what we saw in the second quarter and then once we cycle, we would certainly expect to see next year or typical grocery inflation. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: Okay, and then my follow-up, maybe you can just reconcile what you just said about deflation being persistent because I think in the guidance it says the costs for the remainder of this year consistent with or slightly lower than they were in the second half of last year. I think the second half of last year, maybe I’m misinterpreting, I think you were still looking at costs in the 5% to 6% range. Am I missing something there?
J. Michael Schlotman: What that was attempting to say was that while it went up last year in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter, we would expect no inflation to slight deflation in the back half of this year compared to those high cost increases last year. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: Okay, thanks. 
J. Michael Schlotman: It’s not saying we are going to have the same inflation as last year’s second half. We feel it’s going to be flat to slightly down. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: Okay. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things -- Dave, I guess from the guidance with regard to the back half of the year on comp, you have seen no further slippage in your comp number here early in the third quarter but that number has held. And then you would expect to get a bump in the fourth quarter on maybe less deflation and general merchandise, with Fred Meyer coming back. Is that fair?
David B. Dillon: Well, actually it’s not quite accurate. If you look at the third quarter so far and we only have four weeks I think into the quarter, our identical sales actually are down a little from what we experienced in the second quarter. However, and it’s a big however, the comparisons are actually difficult, beginning I think roughly last week, for us to draw many conclusions because last year you may recall we had several storms, hurricanes, one of which actually just this last weekend a year ago came up through the Midwest and did quite a bit of damage, so the comparisons are kind of tricky right at the moment but I did want to make sure you knew that our sales so far in this quarter are down just a little bit from where they were last quarter. That obviously suggests that later in the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter that we expect to see some modest pick-up in our sales in order to get within the guidance and that would be accurate. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: The follow-up to that, first quarter didn’t you say what the tonnage growth was? I thought it might have been 4% or something like that. Is that not right?
David B. Dillon: I don’t know if we did or not. 
J. Michael Schlotman: The only thing that we talked about in the first quarter going off of memory would be on corporate brands had double-digit tonnage growth and that national brands actually had slightly negative tonnage growth. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. All right and then finally, if you look at the ROI of your price investments and obviously you are doing this, you are picking up some traffic, you expect to keep those customers as the economy gets better -- how do you look at the ROI and do we know yet if the returns you are getting are comparable to what you’ve gotten in the past?
David B. Dillon: Well, we obviously believe the ROI on the price investments is worth the investment. We believed it at the time we took the position or we wouldn’t have taken it and we continue to believe it or we wouldn’t have maintained that price position.  The good part about it at Kroger is we get a look at the customer through our customer insights and that allows us to adjust as we go, so as if we see something that we don’t think is going to pay off in the short or long run, depending on what our expectations of the particular investment was, then we change it. And that’s been true through the quarter and it’s been through actually in the past as well. 
J. Michael Schlotman: And if you go back at the price investments that we would have made two or three years ago, we are very, very happy with the results that we’ve got from those and it’s one of those things where you continue to measure over an extended period of time, and as Dave mentioned, if something is not working, you adjust accordingly. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  Good morning. Just to dig in a little bit on private label gains, are your gains slowing a little bit now that the brands have begun to grow again? If you could speak to that a little bit. 
David B. Dillon: Well, we had two -- three quarters now in a row where our percent of units sold in grocery in corporate brands was 35%. Fourth quarter, first quarter and second quarter, all three were 35%. Now, the growth in the fourth and first quarter was roughly a 300 basis point increase and the growth this last quarter was roughly 200 basis point increase and so I suppose the rate of growth is different but that’s only because last year the rate was different. But we’re still running 35%, which is strong.  Now, we see this as a continuing trend. We do not see it subsiding. We are very happy with that. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  And what do you think is behind the trend change on the branded side of the house?
David B. Dillon: I actually think it’s two things -- I think it’s using our investments in brands effectively. Our customer insights helps us think about how we spend our money on promotions and on pricing and on promotional pricing, everyday pricing and so forth. And I think that helps us target the customer where the customer wants to be targeted. And second is I think some of the national brand vendors are really trying to regain some tonnage movement and see us as a natural place to do it since we are effective at using money wisely in that regard.  It does not seem to affect really the growth though of our corporate brands and so we see that as really good news, that it broadens the customer appeal and we see that all as positive news. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. And then on the deflation discussion, is there any insight you can give us on what’s going on on the supply side in any of those categories? Have farmers backed off on production? Is there anything that could point to that could end some of the deflation just from supplies tightening up?
David B. Dillon: Well, if you look at -- like on dairy, as an example, there’s been a reduction in the number of milk cows but this summer has been so mild there’s actually been an increase in the production of milk. So if you look at net net, there’s actually an increase in production of milk. At some point, that will -- you will have a normal cycle and that will affect the amount of milk that’s out in the market and it will affect cheese also.  Mike mentioned to me corn is the same thing, where there’s fewer acreage this year but so far it’s been a very good growing season when you look at the country overall, so there’s plenty of supply there. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  And produce is another area where you’ve had some double-digit deflation -- what’s going on there?
J. Michael Schlotman: As you know, that will change for each season. The summer season was incredibly strong, both from a quality standpoint -- I mean, the product was eating outstanding and there was a lot of it. That won't always happen but we just had an incredibly good summer from a produce standpoint. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. And just maybe a little more color on the increased competitive activity. It sounds like you probably invest a little more gross margin than you would have liked because of what others were doing. If you could talk about that a little bit. 
David B. Dillon: Well, we don’t talk about specific markets on competitive activity but it’s pretty clear that there was more of it this quarter than in the past. We’ve always described quarters as being highly competitive and I think that certainly continues but we just saw more markets that had retailers trying to regain some lost position in the -- during the quarter and that caused us to make sure that we were responding appropriately.  We look at market share as a very important strength for Kroger and plan to keep it that way. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Dave, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in terms of your IDs and where you are running now and what you expect for the rest of the year. I mean, it seems like you need IDs to pick up from here to hit the guidance that you provided. Is that how we should think about that or are there other moving parts to that?
David B. Dillon: Our year-to-date through the second quarter IDs without fuel are 2.9%, so to be within the guidance, we obviously have to be better than we’ve been running to get it back up to 3 or higher. And we indicated that in the first four weeks -- it’s just four weeks but the first four weeks of the third quarter were a little bit less than what we experienced in the second quarter. That’s also correct but then identified that the storms and stuff from last year made at least last week and even this week, and maybe even the week after, a little hard to compare. So it will take us another three or four weeks before we see the picture more clearly but that what we are expecting is some pick-up in our IDs through the remainder of the year, particularly later in the year, especially as we think and believe and expect and hope that produce deflation moderates a little and dairy deflation moderates a little. Those two by themselves, I gave that number earlier where if you take just those two areas, produce and dairy and try as we can, although there’s no real sure way to do this, try as we can to adjust and say if we had not had the deflation but did have the tonnage growth, what would our ID sales have been? And it was roughly a 200 basis point impact. So it’s a big deal. If we saw some change in that area, even if the tonnage didn’t quite maintain, I think we would see some pick-up in ID sales.  So that’s the base of our assumption and how you should think about it. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. And clearly what you have discussed in terms of tonnage, you know, to me seems extremely encouraging and it seems like you are continuing to take share. I mean, should we infer from all that that your acceleration in your price investments are performing at least as well as you would expect relative to plan in your peers?
David B. Dillon: Yes. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. And one last quick question for you -- you did buy back a little bit of stock this quarter. You had indicated previously that you probably wouldn’t be doing that. Why not buy back more at this stance with your stock sitting here at $20 and the credit markets getting much better?
J. Michael Schlotman: Well, we continue to balance our need to make sure we have the right liquidity through this time and while I agree the capital markets are getting better, we do have a bank credit facility that matures in 2011 and somewhere around this time next year we’ll be in the throes of renewing that and once we can see clearly where that’s going to shake out, we’ll take another look at our liquidity. We also think it’s important to get the increase in our credit rating from S&P to triple B flat so that when we redo that credit agreement, we can also issue A2P2 commercial paper, which will be a huge help from the standpoint of how we access the capital markets. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. Good luck the rest of the year, guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Muschkin from Jefferies & Company.
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So beating a dead horse a little bit here but I wanted to get your insights -- you know, we’ve gone now I guess starting in 2001, you guys started to do a lot of price investing but we have actually walked a lot of your stores, Dave, and we would actually concur with what you said about your execution. It seems over the last three years, execution merchandising stocking pricing and all the end caps really is probably as good as some of the private companies out there. When do we not have to invest 88 basis points in gross margin to keep customers loyal? That’s a lot. I’m not saying you guys don’t have to invest still but that’s a lot and it seems like with what we are seeing at the stores, there should be more loyalty or am I missing something? Maybe there’s not an answer here but I would love to have you respond to that.
David B. Dillon: Scott, I appreciate your vote of confidence and your observations and I think that’s reasonably accurate with what we feel about our own business. We would agree with you that the 88 basis points of selling gross that we invested in the quarter is strong, is deeper than we’ve had in recent quarters and I really see it as a bit opportunistic. In this current environment, based on what our customers clearly want, we felt we needed to take some pretty strong positions.  I don’t think most of us in our working career, maybe none of us, have seen an environment, a selling environment quite like what we are experiencing right now. And we are intent on making sure that it turns into a good opportunity for us and for the company, for our shareholders and for our associates and for our customers.  And so we’ve looked for ways in which we can effectively spend money that we think will give a return to the shareholders in the long run but will certainly attract the customers in the short run. We think it’s a current advantage we have. It takes advantage of the customer insight we have, it takes advantage of the financial strength that we have, it takes advantage of the market share that we have. So we see this as really a -- I won't say a one-time opportunity but there are not many times like this and we wanted to make sure we used it to a reasonable extent. We realize the gross investment was deeper than most of you expected and it was deeper than what we had planned for originally for the quarter. But we made -- through the quarter, we made several intentional choices to go down this path because we believe it was the best long-term path for you as shareholders, for our associates, and as I’ve said, for our customers. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Okay, I appreciate that. And just I guess two follow-ups, one on what you are saying -- when you look at the demand curve and what people respond to, you know, you walk into let’s just say a Ralph’s in Southern California, fully stocked produce area, competitors including Walmart not seeing that. Do customers want to pay for that? You know, that type of execution? In other words, if your prices are just as good or better, doesn’t that help you or were you basically saying hey, come to my stores and see what we -- and try to gain actually new customers?
David B. Dillon: That is a trickier call than most of the things -- trickier decision than most of the things that you’ve described up until now because that really is the acid test. There are costs associated with that produce presentation you just described and the question really is do the customers want to pay for that? And we are regularly reevaluating that question, not necessarily, although certainly includes the topic of produce stocking but it includes lots of other things.  You’ve seen some differences in our shelf conditioning, as an example, because we specifically concluded that customers didn’t want to pay for that. And we saved the money and with the savings, we reinvested that into things that the customers did want, which was lower prices, shorter lines in the stores, and a few other things, better in-stock conditions, that kind of thing. So we are constantly trying to reevaluate that.  I think that balance in what services we offer in the stores will probably change over the long haul. It won't change quarter to quarter and week to week. We would just confuse customers with our brand if we were to do that but I think you will see gradual changes over time as we continue to assess what the customers really want in our stores.  But you picked a rather -- I won't call it an extreme example but a really good example because Ralph’s does such a great job in their produce presentation and you do have to ask that question.  Now I’ll also offer that the Ralph’s produce department is a very effective group too. They work real hard and I would give them high credit for getting that done at a minimal amount of cost that it would take to do that. Other parts of the country might not be as successful to deliver on that at the same lower costs that they can achieve. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Certainly if you look at the research that we do with our customers every quarter, this past quarter on our four keys the customers gave us higher ratings than they had before so certainly we are connecting even better with the customers than what we have before.  You know, as you look at over time, and Dave and Mike both mentioned, we would certainly expect more balance in terms of between selling gross reductions and reductions in total operating costs over time. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Actually, we’d love to keep talking about this but I’ll open it up. I may follow up with you guys later today if that’s okay. 
David B. Dillon: Feel free. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie from UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I guess margin is the topic of the day and I just wanted to drill down a little bit more, if I could. It seems to be that there are three main areas of -- or three main reasons why your margin went down. One was planned investments, one was reactive investments, and the other behavioral changes by consumer, with some positive like private label and some negative like trading down.  I just wondered if you could give us a level of magnitude as to which contributed most to the overall 88 basis point decline in the supermarket selling margin?
J. Michael Schlotman: If you look at the four areas that I talked about on deflation, changes in customer behavior, planned investments, and competition, that order would be in terms of how we felt affected the numbers the most. So we felt like deflation affected the gross margin, selling gross the most. Changes in customer behavior was second, planned investments was third and competitive changes was fourth. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Doesn’t competition actually feed into deflation one as well, because I think it was a quarter ago that we talked about milk margins. In fact, obviously the costs are down as well as the selling price and I think a quarter ago, you were saying that units were up and the gross profit dollars were slightly richer in milk, yet that’s changed. And is that to do with more competition?
J. Michael Schlotman: To me, that’s the $6 million question -- how much of it is being driven by the market and how much of it is driven by competition? I think each one of us in the room here would have probably a different answer and I am not sure you can prove what is the right answer but we certainly think the deflation and changes in customer behavior will cause more competitive reactions. 
Neil Currie - UBS: That seems to be the biggest change quarter on quarter, is that last quarter, gross margin seemed to be, and we’ve seen this [inaudible] with the company is that the lower cost of goods sold is not necessarily a bad thing but it seems to now be a bad thing. Would it be right to say that’s been the biggest change quarter to quarter?
J. Michael Schlotman: I think if you only look at the quarter, when you look at longer term, we do not believe it will be a bad thing. 
Neil Currie - UBS: And if I may, I just wanted to ask the same question everybody else has asked but in a slightly different way, which is if you look at the one area that’s -- that you can control better, which is the planned investment, do you feel that you could -- obviously things change through the quarter. Do you feel you could still achieve the sort of tonnage growth that you are achieving whilst moderating that planned investment? How sticky is it?
David B. Dillon: We actually made changes to our original plan before the quarter started and during the quarter. We accelerated a couple of items and we decelerated and postponed a couple of items based on how we read the market at that time. And I believe, personally believe that what we chose to do was a good contributor to the increased tonnage that we experienced and the connection with our households that we experienced. I suppose you could argue on any one of the points of what we did or whether it produced the value but the proof really comes with a little bit of time. And as Rodney correctly pointed out earlier that it’s our past experience with some of these approaches that have helped us interpret what we ought to do today and in today’s environment. And it was a judgment call and that’s what we ended up making. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Thanks, and if I can just ask one more question, you took guidance down for the year by around $0.05 to $0.10, depending on where the high and low point was. And you missed in this quarter the street’s expectations by around $0.05 or so. That seems to indicate that the second half of the year, your expectations are broadly unchanged, enough despite sort of a tough headwind on fuel profit comparisons. So does that indicate that the second half of the year, you feel just fairly secure about your original expectations and the second quarter was really just an inflection point in terms of competition?
J. Michael Schlotman: Well, if you look at -- and we don’t give quarterly guidance but if you look at where the consensus estimates are for the back half of the year and add it to our first half results, it would be the high-end of our range. So if things were to go right and we were to hit the metrics that Dave spoke about in talking about our guidance, that could put us at the high-end of the range, because we’re $1.05 so far and it’s I think $0.95 for the back half of the year is the current street. So I -- we didn’t take $2 off the table but there is variability out there. We have a big mountain to climb in the third quarter with where our retail fuel operations were last year and just the uncertain customer environment is what caused us to give the broader range that we did give. 
Neil Currie - UBS: That’s very helpful. Thanks very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Good morning, everyone. Dave, could you discuss sort of the pace of business in the second quarter, to start off with? I mean, was it getting more difficult as the quarter progressed or was it a very sudden thing at some point in the quarter?
David B. Dillon: We actually saw just two things that were notable in the quarter. Mid-summer, which would have been the middle of the quarter, was softer than I would have expected but the most important thing that we saw was the end of the month was noticeably softer than it had been running before and the first of those end of the months came right after we had this conference call after the first quarter, so the end of June. It was true at the end of June, end of July and it’s safe to say the end of August, even though that’s in the next -- in this new quarter. Those were all soft periods and I think it’s something we’re just going to have to get used to because I think it’s a clear picture for what our customers are going through. They just run low on money by the end of the month and that ends up softening even more the discretionary purchases that you get. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Certainly from a dollar standpoint and from a unit standpoint, not as much so. 
David B. Dillon: That’s true. That’s very true. We still have a lot of physical work in the stores because we have a lot of traffic in the stores end of the month but they are not buying quite as much in the dollar size of what they did before. 
W. Rodney McMullen: So a lower price point. 
David B. Dillon: So I think it’s just a shift in what we have to get used to as handling the business. It’s not a danger sign or anything like that but that’s really what we saw in the quarter. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Are you seeing the private label national brand split more distinct towards the end of the month?
David B. Dillon: You know, I don’t know that I’ve looked at that, so I don’t know that I have an answer. I’m looking around and I don’t think we have an answer for that, Chuck. That’s an interesting question. I’d suspect that I would -- I mean, I would hypothesize that there are some changes in the end of the month in a number of ways and that could certainly be one of them. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: Can you talk about the growth you saw in loyal households in the items? You were happy with the growth in each. Could you describe what is a loyal household and how much stronger things actually are?
David B. Dillon: Well, I’ll give you a sense -- loyal households, we use an internal definition which I won't repeat or share but it basically is a grid that is made up of frequency of visits and amount of purchase in a period of time before we will count somebody as a household that is loyal to Kroger. And loyal doesn’t mean exclusively with us -- in fact, you’ve heard me talk a lot before about we believe that among our loyal households that as much as 50% of their business that they could give us, they are giving to other places, other outlets. So there’s still significant increases available from our loyal households. So you can imagine what the non-loyal households have to offer. But we are seeing a growth in that area. We are also seeing specifically a growth disproportionately high, not huge but still disproportionately high, the new households, new loyal households that we are seeing are disproportionately in the direction of customers who are a little more price sensitive. Now, that could be driven by what is happening in the economy. We certainly think what we are doing helps with that because we are trying to play to that sweet spot and we believe it affects the way people shop and certainly our data would suggest that too. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And included in this definition you mentioned, it would be the tonnage growth -- that’s where that’s coming from? More households, more loyalty?
David B. Dillon: Yeah, we actually track tonnage two different -- at least two different ways. One is to look at what moves through our warehouses and goes to the stores. On that basis, we were very happy with tonnage. With the households, we actually track units that they buy in each visit and then we track units that that household buys over the course of time. And as we pointed out in the households, they are actually buying fewer units each time they come but they are coming enough more often that the average number of units that a household is buying from us is higher than it was. So that’s actually good news. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And deli bakery was one of your stronger categories, I think somebody said? I just want to check on that. 
David B. Dillon: Yes, that was one of the departments that was better than our average. We are very happy with that area. 
J. Michael Schlotman: It still seems pretty clear that people are switching from going to restaurants and eating at home and either buying things in our stores to prepare at home or buying things in our deli department. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: And finally, you had a number in the press release about the purchase of the leased facilities. Is that strictly your own buildings or does that include from other companies, other retailers’ buildings?
J. Michael Schlotman: It’s by and large facilities we operated that were leased that we had the opportunity to buy out that lease. There was one building we acquired with the way you described but it was only one. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: How do you feel about the opportunity over the rest of this year and into next year, actually, being able to purchase buildings from other owners, other operators?
J. Michael Schlotman: I would think it would continue. There’s one that came across my desk just today. It was a property we’ve been trying to negotiate with the owner to buy it out. They didn’t like our offer. They actually decided to take it to auction and we are now going to buy it because we have first right of refusal on the property, that we are now going to wind up buying it at what it went for auction for, which was well below our original offer, so we are glad they didn’t take our offer. 
Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research: All right. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from BMO Capital Markets. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets:   Just a couple of questions, sorry to beat a dead horse also on this one but as it relates to the planned investments, I know you said you accelerated some and then decelerated some but for the full year, it’s fair to say that you will increase your planned investments. Is that right?
David B. Dillon: Let’s see if I can describe it this way -- that’s not right. I think the planned investments will be fewer this year than what we had originally had in mind but I can say that at least one of them is a little more expensive than what we had originally planned, which is entered into our thinking. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets:   Okay, and then I guess just switching to the environment, a couple of questions within this -- you know, you said you had two divisions that have slightly negative IDs. Can you just give some color around how that might -- I know there was only one division in the fourth quarter and then one division in the first quarter but they weren’t the same division. Can you maybe just give some color on that?  And then wondering if you can just talk about the environment and how you -- I mean, obviously it’s competitive. Would you say it’s become irrational?
David B. Dillon: I actually don’t remember which divisions were negative in the previous two quarters so I don’t know whether it’s the same ones or now. Mike may know that and answer it in a second but I think it’s real important in the deflationary picture that we only had two that were negative and those two that were negative were less than 1% negative -- I mean, I think that’s an astounding picture, personally. So I think that’s important to note. Did you want to answer that question?
J. Michael Schlotman: On the negative divisions, the divisions are different than what the division was in the fourth quarter and what it was in the first quarter. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, so that just illustrates what is happening, is the market is in a bit of a state of flux. It just is. I mean, this is just an unusual market time. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets:   Okay, and then I guess just the last question -- Mike, can you just elaborate on what you think needs to happen for you to get an S&P upgrade, or a rating change?
J. Michael Schlotman: Well, they came out a couple of weeks back and put us on positive credit watch, which in their language means that a ratings upgrade should be imminent. They described the environment that it would take for that upgrade to occur and in their model, we could have a decline in EBITDA of up to 2% this year and still have the metrics that they think would allow us to be upgraded. And while this quarter was soft, if you look at EBITDA year-to-date, we are up on EBITDA year-to-date. So I think we are hitting the metrics that they want us to hit and we have a lot of conversation with them. Obviously ultimately they have -- they are the decision-maker, not us but we continue to deliver from a credit metric standpoint what it is we promise to deliver. 
Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets:   Okay, great. Thanks very much. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Karen. We have time for one more question. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays Capital. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Most everything has been answered but I was just wondering if you could comment, when you talk about trading down or changes in consumer behavior, you didn’t mention consumers buying more product on promotion. Other market chains have talked about that. I was wondering if that’s something you were seeing. 
David B. Dillon: I think it’s fair to say we are seeing a little bit of that but is that because of the state of mind of the consumer and our customers or is that because the markets are a little bit more promotional with the competitive activity? I’m not sure I know the answer to that question. I’m looking around to see if there’s any other color to that but I’m not sure that we have anything more to add. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And do you believe that having the frequent shopper data and being able to be more targeted in your promotions allows you to avoid having to do sort of widespread kinds of promotional activity?
David B. Dillon: Sometimes it does but a lot of what we have done in this past quarter would have -- is pretty obvious, either in our ads or in our stores and wouldn’t be targeted individually but the thing about what we are picking and the value of some of our consumer insights is it allows us to understand when we pick an item or a price or the combination, it helps us to understand who is the target audience that that item and that price speaks to, because even though it may be available in the store to everybody, it obviously doesn’t speak to everyone. So that’s really the value of consumer, customer insight for us is it can target the way in which we behave in the store. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And we use that data more and more to go to suppliers and suggest things to try together to enhance their volume and enhance the loyalty for our customers with our customers also. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, we talked about the national brand increased tonnage in the quarter and I think one of the contributions there that created that is the vendors we do the best job with are ones we are partnering with, who work with us and thinking about how to use this data effectively, just like Rodney described. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And is there any change in the level of support that you feel you are getting from vendors, either secularly or because of your ability to partner?
David B. Dillon: Well, I think vendors are generally speaking, and this isn’t just with us, they weren’t happy with their tonnage so I think they are trying to reassess what they do on pricing, both list price and also promotional money. One of the advantages that we have at Kroger is that we partner well with national vendors and the insight that we have allows us to effectively spend the money that we can use to invest with the customer, so it ends up being a good spend and as you can see then, good results. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you very much. 
David B. Dillon: Meredith, thank you and before we sign off though, I do have a few thoughts I want to share for our associates who we encourage to listen in. First, I want to thank you for your hard work during the quarter. We are making a difference in the lives of our customers by offering more and more ways to save money and to take care of their families. You are the direct link to our customers and we appreciate all you do every day.  I want to say a special thanks to the 55 associates who will be featured on products sold in our stores next month as part of our Giving Hope a Hand Breast Cancer awareness campaign. These terrific ladies are encouraging others to take charge of their own health by sharing their personal journeys as breast cancer survivors with their fellow associates and our customers. They are an inspiration to each of us and we are fortunate to have them on our team.  And on a final note, I want to thank Don McGeorge and congratulate Rodney McMullen. Don has devoted 32 year-career to the Kroger Company and he has influenced every aspect of our business over the years. He is a true champion of associates and customers and we are all indebted to Don for his exceptional leadership, balanced with just the right amount of humor.  And Rodney has stepped into the job as President and Chief Operating Officer and many of you already know Rodney but for those of you who haven’t met him yet, you will find him to be a passionate retailer who, like Don and I, started in our stores. We look forward to his insightful leadership in his new role.  That completes the call today. We thank all of you very much for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Kroger Company first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. My name is Katina and I’ll be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Carin Fike : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I will turn it over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon: Thank you, Carin and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me today to review Kroger’s first quarter 2009 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today we are pleased to report very solid results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are off to a good start for the year, particularly considering the environment in which we are operating. Our Customer 1st strategy continues to serve Kroger customers and shareholders well. By paying close attention to the changing needs of today’s shoppers, Kroger continues to refine the value proposition that we offer to our customers through a combination of better service, improved product variety and quality, a shopping experience that is appealing and convenient, and lower prices. This approach allows us to report the first quarter sales and earnings results that we are discussing with you today. Let’s begin with sales. Total sales in the first quarter were $22.8 billion compared with $23.1 billion for the same period last year. That comparison may look a bit unusual, and it reflects the year-over-year decline in retail fuel prices. As a point of reference, during the first quarter of the current year, the average retail price for a gallon of gas sold at Kroger’s fuel outlets was 41% lower than it was during the corresponding quarter last year. When you exclude fuel sales, Kroger’s total sales for the first quarter increased 3.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales, without fuel, increased 3.1%. Several departments posted identical sales growth above the company average, including meat, pharmacy, deli/bakery, and grocery. Strong sales in these areas were tempered by continued slowness in sales of discretionary general merchandise as well as deflation in produce. Even so, all but one of our supermarket divisions posted positive identical results. As you know, we believe that identical sales growth, excluding fuel, is a very important metric for evaluating Kroger’s business. Internally, we also look at a few other measures, and I thought sharing color on some of those measures would give you better insight into our first quarter sales trends. Some of the other metrics we look at include customer traffic, unit sales growth or perhaps tonnage, and corporate brand share. In each of these areas, we saw positive trends in the quarter. Our corporate brands enjoyed another quarter of double-digit growth in both dollar and unit sales. In the Grocery department, the corporate brands represented 26% of sales dollars and 35% of units sold. As in the third and fourth quarters last year, our overall tonnage growth in grocery was driven by corporate brands. National brand grocery unit sales declined slightly, but at a slower rate of decline than we saw in the third and fourth quarters last year. Based on these results, it is clear to us that the customers continue to look to our own high-quality store brands and the value they offer. And while this shift affects Kroger’s identical sales results, since our store brands typically carry retail prices significantly lower than the national brand equivalent, some as much as 50% lower, it is a trade-off we are happy to make for the long-term growth of our business. Our identical sales growth is also affected by product cost changes, but the impact can vary considerably across different product categories. So take a deflationary category like milk, for example. While we sold more units, retail prices for milk pressured our first quarter sales results. On the flipside, higher inflation in tobacco helped our sales growth but depressed unit sales on these products. Naturally, product cost changes have always been a factor in our retail pricing decisions. But in the current environment, we are seeing much greater variability and we expect it to continue throughout the year. This adds even more complexity to our business as we manage through this environment. This morning we confirmed our guidance for fiscal 2009. We are forecasting full-year identical supermarket sales growth of 3% to 4%, without fuel. This guidance reflects our outlook for product cost inflation of 1% to 2%. Our full-year earnings expectation for fiscal 2009 remains at $2.00 to $2.05 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance was a strong start to the year but it is still early and while our earnings per share results were well ahead of the consensus estimate, they were only slightly ahead of our internal budget. Looking forward, there are several variables that will likely influence Kroger’s financial results for the balance of the year. These key trends include: Commodity Costs -- our manufacturing plants enjoyed an outstanding quarter as we benefited from strong volume and lower commodity costs. However, based on rising costs for many commodities today, we do not expect that to continue for the rest of the year. Diesel Fuel Costs -- our logistics operations benefited from lower diesel fuel costs during the quarter. Again, based on a number of variables from a global perspective, we do not expect to have the benefit of lower diesel costs for the remainder of the year. Consumer Behavior -- shoppers remain cautious in this economy and we do not anticipate that changing any time soon. We expect customers’ spending patterns to continue to reflect their uncertainty. As you think about Kroger’s outlook for the full year, recall that as we described last March when we shared our 2009 expectations with you, margins for our retail fuel business are expected to be much lower in 2009 than they were in 2008. The toughest comparisons will be in the second and third quarters of this year. This headwind will be offset somewhat by lower LIFO expenses. Excluding the benefit of the lower LIFO expense, we anticipate a slight increase in Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin. This operating margin expansion plus the 3% to 4% identical sales growth creates the earnings growth reflected by our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2009. This guidance reflects our commitment to delivering solid near-term financial results even in a tough operating environment, while investing in the future growth of our business. On top of that earnings growth, Kroger’s dividend adds over 1% to shareholder return. That kind of return should look attractive to investors in this market. Now I will turn to Rodney for additional details on the quarter. Rodney.
W. Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. As our first quarter performance indicates, our associates understand the importance of our Customer 1st strategy and its focus on people, products, lower prices, and the overall shopping experience in our family of stores. The strength of our Customer 1st strategy and the flexibility of our business model enable us to continue to deliver value for both customers and you, our shareholders, in this difficult environment. At the same time, we are investing in Kroger’s long-term growth as we work to emerge in an even stronger position once the economy recovers. Let’s take a closer look at our performance during the quarter. Kroger’s first quarter net earnings were $435.1 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings of $386 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, in the same period last year. We are pleased to report strong earnings results for the quarter, yet these results are only slightly above our internal expectations, as Dave mentioned before. There is extreme volatility in many of our input costs and it is still early in the year. We encourage analysts to keep that in mind as you think about our guidance for the year. Turning now to Kroger’s gross margin performance, FIFO gross margin excluding Kroger’s retail fuel operations, rose 5 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We continued to make investments in lower prices for customers, as reflected by our supermarket selling gross margin, which declined 48 basis points compared to the same period last year. Improvements in shrink, advertising, and warehousing costs as a rate of sales, as well as lower diesel fuel costs, funded Kroger’s investments in lower prices. As Dave mentioned, we do not expect the benefit of lower diesel fuel prices to be significant for the rest of the year. On LIFO, we recorded a $23.1 million LIFO charge during the quarter, a decrease of $16.9 million from the prior year. This decline benefited Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin by 9 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Our estimated product cost inflation for the quarter, excluding fuel, was 3.6%. Cost inflation across several store departments, including grocery, drug/general merchandise, nutrition, and deli/bakery, was tempered slightly by deflation in produce and dairy. For the full year, we continue to expect a $75 million LIFO charge, which would be $121 million lower than the prior year. Kroger’s first quarter OG&A rate, excluding the company’s retail fuel operations, was flat compared to the prior year. I believe the company’s OG&A performance was actually better than that comparison suggests, so I’ll take a moment to explain why. Kroger has three non-wholly owned investments: dunnhumbyUSA, The Little Clinic, and i-wireless. Excluding both our retail fuel operations as well as the effect of these investments have on OG&A, Kroger’s first quarter OG&A rate declined 14 basis points as a percentage of sales. This decline reflects strong cost controls as well as our ongoing efforts to control utility costs through several efficiency initiatives that we have implemented. We do see continued opportunities in these areas, which will help us offset ongoing cost pressures Kroger faces in pension, health care expenses and credit card fees. Kroger’s first quarter operating margin, excluding our retail fuel operations, expanded 20 basis points. As you may recall, our 2009 guidance indicates that we expect a slight expansion of Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin, excluding the benefit of an expected lower LIFO charge. On this basis and excluding the effect of the three non-wholly owned investments I mentioned earlier, Kroger’s first quarter operating margin expanded 18 basis points. This expansion is significantly higher than the slight non-fuel operating margin expansion incorporated in our 2009 guidance and long-term business model. The out-performance was driven primarily by the benefit of lower diesel fuel costs, which we don’t expect to continue for the balance of the year. Several of you I know are interested in the performance of our retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, we sold more fuel gallons compared to the prior year on both an absolute and identical basis, which reflects our customers’ strong interest in this part of our retail offering. While gallons were up, cents per gallon fuel margins were down year-over-year. The cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers was $0.082 in the first quarter compared to $0.092 in the same period last year. Our retail fuel operations did not materially impact total company earnings or year-over-year EPS growth. Because of the margin volatility inherent in selling large volumes of fuel, we always encourage investors to take a longer view of this part of our business. On a rolling four-quarters basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.143 this year compared to $0.114 for the same period a year ago. Please keep in mind that the fuel margins we realized in 2008, particularly in the second and third quarters, were exceptionally strong. Our expectations for the current fiscal year are based on a more normalized fuel margin of $0.11 per gallon. Now I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about our financial strategy. As you know, Kroger’s Customer 1st strategy is supported by the disciplined and balanced approach we take regarding our long-term financial strategy. We believe it is important to allocate cash flow to keep our store base current, reduce Kroger’s leverage, and provide a solid return for shareholders. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions, totaled $654 million for the first quarter, compared to $637 million in the prior year. We did not invest in acquisitions in the first quarter of this year, compared with $80 million invested in the same period last year. Capital projects during the quarter included 10 new, relocated, or expanded stores and 37 remodels. Our return on asset measures improved year-over-year. We continue to project fiscal 2009 capital spending of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. Net total debt was $7.4 billion, a decrease of $243 million from a year ago. On a rolling four-quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.78 compared with 1.95 during the same period last year. This compares favorably to the 1.77 ratio we reported in the second quarter of 2007, which was the lowest ratio since our leveraged recap in 1988.  We expect to continue to improve Kroger’s debt coverages on a year-over-year basis. Kroger’s bias toward debt reduction and away from share buybacks remains. We believe this is the right approach in the current environment to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and allow the financial flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities. On the labor front, we have some progress to report. Earlier this year, we successfully completed contract negotiations in Roanoke, Virginia and Las Vegas. Last week, our Smith’s associates in New Mexico ratified a new agreement. We are currently in some tough negotiations in Denver and have contract extensions in Arizona, Dayton, and Portland. Later this year, we will negotiate agreements for our store associates in Atlanta and Dallas. In addition to the normal pressures on our business, the twin challenges of rising health care costs and under-funded pension plans will have to play out at the bargaining table. Before I turn it back over to Dave, I want to thank our associates for their efforts during the quarter. We delivered value to our customers and our shareholders in an environment that is incredibly trying. We are able to do this because of your commitment to our Customer 1st strategy. Listening to customers and responding to their needs is a critical part of our strategy to earn customers’ loyalty for life. It is also an important part of our objective to create a sustainable business model that rewards shareholders with long-term value creation. Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. As you can see from the results we reported this morning and the information we shared with you today, Kroger established good momentum in the first quarter. We are focused on maintaining this momentum throughout the year by investing in what we offer customers and adapting along the way to meet their changing needs. We expect to emerge on the other side of this recession as an even stronger player. Now, we would be happy to take a few moments to answer your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.
Susan Anderson - Citigroup: This is actually Susan Anderson for Deborah Weinswig. Good job on the quarter, you guys. First, can you talk a little bit about Kroger’s tuck-in strategy and the strategy for gaining market share? Do you expect any real estate opportunities to open up as a result of the weak economy and some consolidation we’re seeing? I think the last quarter, you mentioned that valuations are still too high. Have you seen those come down yet?
David B. Dillon: I didn’t hear the first part of your sentence but if I understood you right, you wanted to talk a little bit about how we see the market in terms of acquisitions. 
Susan Anderson - Citigroup: Correct, yes. 
David B. Dillon: And I would say we see it pretty much the same as what we’ve described before. We of course have lots of good opportunities we’ve seen in some of the end market acquisitions that we’ve made and those are episodic as they become available. Always interested in those.  Bigger ones, of course, are certainly available out there. There’s lots of opportunity but prices are still a little steep and we tend to be cautious and wanting to be careful to pick something that’s a good fit for us. Rodney, do you want to add anything?
W. Rodney McMullen: No, I just completely agree and we continue to look at several things but from a pricing standpoint, we haven’t found anything that really makes sense. 
Susan Anderson - Citigroup: Okay, great. And then also can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? It seems like it’s still pretty stiff out there. It seems like a number of grocers are doing things in terms of price cut promotions to drive traffic. Maybe talk about what you guys are doing and then also what you are doing with your loyalty card, any new initiatives there?
David B. Dillon: Sure. Well, the competitive environment, as always, I think, is probably our standard description is it’s a very competitive environment out there and you’re right -- in a number of markets, people are reaching out for sales. We feel though pretty good about our situation. In fact, if you think about -- let’s think about the sales we just reported, the identical sales growth without fuel of 3.1%. Sometimes [the number] is a great indication of where we are. Sometimes it’s actually too good of an indication of where we are -- that is, it overstates the fact; and other times, it’s the reverse. In this case, I think there are a number of factors that suggest that the 3.1 actually is not as good an indicator of where we are, that we actually did better than what that number shows. We talked about some of those but if you think about the competitive environment and how that plays out, our tonnage and units was up, our pharmacy scripts are up, our gasoline gallons are up, our Kroger brand sales were up strongly. We’re seeing some wild numbers that will tend to cause these numbers to get a little skewed, like the inflation and deflation we described, particularly in milk where our units were up strongly but the dollars are down because of the deflation in milk, as an example.  We of course are seeing the impact of discretionary GM but from the customer point of view, we’re seeing behavior that, based on the economy, that is pretty similar to what we’ve seen in the past. And one of the reasons we are comfortable in describing this continuing is if you look at our second quarter so far through four weeks, we are about the same level of identical sales without fuel as what we were running the quarter we just finished. That continues to give us confidence that while the consumer is uncertain and that uncertainty seems to be continuing, it does not seem to be getting worse but at the same time, it doesn’t look like it’s materially improving.  Now I realize that doesn’t get exactly to the competitive question but to me the way for us to answer that is how are we doing and how are we feeling we’re connecting with our customers and what are we seeing in our sales. And as you can tell, I’m actually more bullish, even, then the 3.1% ought to imply and in these circumstances, 3.1 is pretty darn good. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The only other thing I would add in terms of the use of the loyalty card, that’s something that dunnhumby and working with Don McGeorge and Don Becker over an extended period of time, we continue to modify the offering, modify the way we interact with customers and you continue to see improving engagements measured by redemption rates and customers that are actually engaged using mailings that we send. So we see continued progress. I don’t think there’s anything that we want to talk about that’s a huge new initiative until we actually do something. 
Susan Anderson - Citigroup: Great. Thanks a lot. Good job on the quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things -- how would you describe the balance you thought you had this quarter between price investment and comp? I know you guys are always struggling for the right balance. It’s hard to get that every quarter but how do you think the balance was this quarter?
David B. Dillon: Actually, I felt pretty good about it. Some of the numbers you think about, our gross margin that we showed was up five basis points but as you know, I actually look at the selling gross a lot more closely, because that’s more reflective of whether we invested in lower pricing or not, and that was down 48 basis points. Now, that was all offset, plus a little, actually, by the shrink in advertising and warehousing improvement and of course, diesel fuel. And if you combine then our OG&A and as Rodney pointed out, I look at the OG&A as actually improving by 14 basis points. If I wanted to look at a flow of our business and whether or not it improved or not, I would take those variable entities out and look instead at the 14 basis points and if you combine the decline of 14 basis points of OG&A and you combine that with our improvements in shrink advertising and warehouse improvement, even taking out the diesel fuel, we still had good progress on saving money to be reinvested on behalf of the customer. And we selectively did reinvest it as the selling gross decline illustrates.  So actually I feel pretty good about it. If there’s anything in this market that I am encouraging us to keep look at, it’s keep pushing for sales, because we believe sales are available. We’re proud and pleased with where we are but we are pushing ourselves to do even a little bit better because sales are really our future and our strategy, and as we invest in those sales, we expect to have even more savings than can be applied back in, that which then produces the earnings growth that we forecasted in our guidance. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Do you think the rate of reinvestment increases as we go through the year or stays about the same?
David B. Dillon: I think we read it as we go, John. I don’t think that we can necessarily answer that. What we are targeted at is the sales guidance we indicated between the 3% and 4%. We’re pushing ourselves to be squarely there and we are pushing ourselves to be squarely at the earnings, the $2.00 to $2.05 a share. And as we do that, we measure ourselves as we go and if, of course, if sales don’t pan out, then we push ourselves a little harder to get those sales because we think our earnings are the direct result of the sales. So that’s why we’re going to push that point.  So I don’t know that I can predict it except that I would say the whole year is going to look pretty much like we’ve described. Now, we had a lot of tailwind in the first quarter. Diesel fuel is maybe the best example but there were other illustrations. The commodity costs that we talked about and some other things, but if you take those into account, we of course think the rest of the year is going to be a little bit harder if you just look at a comparison to the previous year. But I think it’s going to be the same plan that we played out in the first quarter on the whole. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Just on dairy and produce deflation, how much do you think the combination hurt the comp by? Could it have been 100 basis points or not that big? And then when does that start to flatten out year over year?
David B. Dillon: Well, I don’t think we have a number to give you. I would be surprised if it was 100 basis points. That strikes me as too high. But both of those were important areas that you are describing and in terms of flattening that out, I don’t know. Rodney, do you have an opinion on that?
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, if you look at dairy, we expect it to go up from where it is today but throughout the year we still expect it to be lower this year than it was last year for the equivalent period of time.  The item that probably affected the identicals the most and really was some of the background on Dave’s comment about he feels more confident on the number than what the 3.1% would show, is if you look at the switch from national brand to corporate brands, this is a rough estimate and there’s several different ways you can calculate it but we think that hurt identicals by about seven-tenths of a percent just by itself, and that would actually be more than the dairy and produce deflation. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right, and then finally, I think you said in the fourth quarter that non-food hurt the comp by 40 basis points or so. Was that similar in the first quarter or different?
David B. Dillon: I don’t have that number, if we’re looking to see if we have that. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The 40 basis points was Fred Myer only, John, not total non-food. 
David B. Dillon: And in the fourth quarter, that would have been a bigger impact than in the first quarter because it was a fourth quarter holiday season. 
W. Rodney McMullen: It was about 20 basis points or so in the first quarter versus 40 in the fourth quarter because of what Dave said. 
David B. Dillon: So about half the impact. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The holiday selling. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman representing Canaccord Adams.
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: First, can you just touch on basket versus traffic? And then as a follow-on to that, if we look at the basket that consumers are purchasing today, can the number of units actually continue to go down? And I’m just asking you to base that on history. And where I’m going is if you get a little bit of reinflation in the back half of the year, could that be a good thing or if basket size is to go down further, could you see more sensitivity from the customer?
David B. Dillon: Well, interesting question. Thank you. Average sale actually was down a little bit in the quarter and transaction count, if you look just purely at transaction count, it was up strongly. If you look at our own customer loyalty data, what we see happening is customers are coming in more often but they are buying less in the individual trip than they were buying before. But the combination of the two produces -- generally has produced increases. Now certainly there’s some households that are buying fewer items over the course of a month but there are many households that are actually buying more items from us in the course of a month. It’s just that they are visiting us more often.  What we believe is happening is customers are buying what they need when they need it, closer to when they need it to make sure that their dollars stretch further to the end of the month, or to the end of the pay period. I think we have seen that now actually for several quarters, and so to me it’s actually pretty clear what they are doing in that regard. But the net result for us though is it gives you a misleading feeling that we are selling less to people but in fact I think customers are consolidating more of their purchases at Kroger and I think we are actually selling more items to many households than we were before.  So that actually bodes well. Now, at the end of the year if we end up with a little bit more inflation and we’ve commented on some of the commodity costs that we think could sort of reverse themselves and create a little bit higher issue for those items, at least, you could see resistance on those items but I think you may find people shifting to other items. And as a result, I’m fairly bullish about what the rest of this year is going to look like. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: And is it possible that -- yeah, sorry. 
W. Rodney McMullen: You had also mentioned in your question can units keep going down. I don’t -- just specifically on the units going down, we continue to see very strong unit sales growth. It’s the national brand that is down a little but that’s way more than offset by the strength of our corporate brands. 
Unidentified Participant:  I think corporate brands is double-digits. 
David B. Dillon: I’d put that in proper perspective because first, I don’t see units as really doing down. They may be going down on an individual shop basis and most stores would measure that on a per transaction basis. We measure it on a household basis and when you look at it the way we’re looking at it, it’s actually not really declining generally. Now, certainly some households but on the whole it’s not and that double-digit growth in our own Kroger brand is just gigantic and in grocery, it was 35% of the unit sales so you can just do the math yourself how important that was to us. And the national brands were down in tonnage but only slightly down and down at a less of a declining rate than they were in the fourth quarter, so that’s actually an improved position. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: And is it possible that maybe the decline in retail fuel prices is not -- well, I guess what you sell and then to customers, is helping the number of visits people are coming around? And I guess at the same time with the competitive environment, I guess you described as not getting materially changing that much, maybe -- is there more of a cherry-picking mentality that you think that your customer has now versus before?
David B. Dillon: No, I don’t see a greater cherry picking mentality at all. In fact, the way we are trying to do our program is based upon winning households over a long period of time and winning their loyalty and that kind of approach doesn’t really target the cherry-pickers. It’s possible that the increased frequency of visits might have some relationship to gas prices but I actually think it has a lot more to do with how people are feeling about their money and how they stretch their money over a longer period of time, and I also do think that lower gas prices tends to put, and in fact it does put, more money in people’s pockets, which of course helps us -- helps every retailer, for that matter. 
W. Rodney McMullen: But if you look at recently fuel prices have been going back up and you can hear increasing concern from customers about the price of fuel. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: And then lastly just on the pace of [ID] through the quarter, and I forget if you comment on this but I’m curious where you ended the quarter and I heard your comments that you are relatively flat with where you left off in the current quarter. 
David B. Dillon: We didn’t give any dimension on how it went through the quarter. I think it’s probably enough to make sure you knew that in the first four weeks of the second quarter, we’re about the same as where we were last quarter, which we take as a positive note that things are as steady as they were. 
Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly representing Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Good morning and nice quarter in a tough environment. My question for you is on your ID sales and the fact that your ID sales so far in the first four weeks of this quarter are up similar to last quarter to me it would seem encouraging because you are beginning to cycle the stimulus promotion that you had last year. Do you view that as a headwind? Does it make it tougher to cycle that? And then I’d just be curious as to whether you would view the underlying comp as a little bit better because you are cycling a tougher comparison?
David B. Dillon: I would really agree with just about everything you said except that I don’t think I would play up too much the headwind from last year’s tax rebate promotion. It was a good promotion and based on what we know about which customers it targeted, I don’t really feel like we are going to have as much headwind as maybe what you described, even though I liked having the promotion that we had. And I do feel good about the sales trend in this current second quarter. I do take it as a positive picture and I think it’s worth remembering that and so I think you’ve probably sized it up just right. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. And on the gross margin side, you saw a pretty big benefit it looks like from shrink, advertising, lower warehouse expense. How sustainable are those items? And then, I don’t know if you can maybe break out the diesel impact so we know what doesn’t continue?
David B. Dillon: Well, I’ll see if Rodney and Mike want to give some numbers on that specifically but I’ll tell you on shrink, advertising, and warehousing expenses, I am very pleased with the teams that work on those, both in those particular disciplines but also in our operating divisions who work with those too. Our results were very good and in my opinion, those results are pretty sustainable.  We are trying to do the kinds of things -- we’ve talked about shrink often enough, where we’ve said we try some things and it hurts our sales because we went too far. I think we are very balanced. We are trying to apply better thinking to the way in which we do shrink and I think our organization has responded well and produced great numbers, very pleased with that and I believe that it can continue.  Do you want to comment on -- 
J. Michael Schlotman: Yeah, if you just look at diesel, on a rough basis it’s about 40% of the total improvement is because of that, so 60% we would view as more sustainable. 
David B. Dillon: So you can see it’s pretty important though. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And the diesel fuel comment is not necessarily the absolute cost of diesel fuel this year versus last year. It’s more relevant to what our expectations and our guidance of 2 to 2.05 was, so it’s more a comparison of what our internal expectations were for diesel fuel. The actual prices in the first quarter were below our expectations and they appear to be trending at or slightly above our internal expectations. I just don’t want people to think that we were doing something magical and buying diesel fuel differently last year versus this year. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then lastly for you, on SG&A, could you provide a little bit more color on those three wholly-owned investments that you talked about and why we’re sort of hearing about them this quarter? I mean, it seems like it could be a few cents a share impact, based on the numbers you gave. And just how that variable sort of plays out the rest of the year -- is it really just a one-time issue?
W. Rodney McMullen: It’s really not anywhere near that size of an effect. You can see the portion of the entities that we don’t own on the very bottom line. If you notice, we don’t have net earnings anymore. We have net earnings attributable to Kroger and that line right above there represents the amount that’s not attributable to Kroger backing out, so it’s a relatively small effect because that’s the portion that we don’t own and they are pretty much not entirely 50-50 but close enough for conversation. The impact is that on the individual lines of the income statement, we have to put all those entities in on every individual line of the income statement now and that’s a result of FASB-160 and two of those are actually entities that are appearing for the first time in that manner because they are new investments as compared to this time last year, that being i-wireless and the Little Clinic.  My hope is that as we cycle this and at this time next year, the effect on our OG&A and gross lines won’t be dramatic and we won’t have to talk about them but putting things in for the first time, because these are start-up entities by and large, so they have fairly high expense rates, relatively low revenue, so when you consolidate them it can make your comparisons look kind of strange, and that’s why we called it out. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. And was there anything else non-operating or non-recurring in SG&A? I mean, you had about 4% growth excluding that. I would have thought that maybe it could have been a little bit better, given the environment. And can it get better than that the rest of the year?
J. Michael Schlotman: You’re looking at the total OG&A as reported?
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Yeah, as a growth rate year over year. 
J. Michael Schlotman: I’m looking up what it was without some of the -- because you can’t see it -- you can’t see it with the entities pulled out. It wasn’t as high as that when you pull out fuel and you pull out the one-time entities, so if you look at the absolute growth in dollars without that, it would have been -- it would not have been a 4% growth rate. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. 
David B. Dillon: Well, to have declined 14 basis points, it couldn’t have been.
J. Michael Schlotman: Right. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karen Short with FBR Capital Markets. 
Karen Short - FBR Capital Markets: Sorry, not to beat a dead horse here but just on your guidance, so I had to paraphrase, it looks like you obviously maintain your guidance for the year on sales and earnings, your sales are currently still in the 3 to 4 -- well, they are still at the 3.1% range but you definitely sound more cautious. I guess the only thing that I can gather that would have changed since your prior guidance is really your diesel expectations or is there something else?
David B. Dillon: Well, let me take you through a little bit of the thinking. I’m not more cautious when it comes to thinking about the strength of our business. I’m actually feeling pretty good about where we are on sales and where the sales can be and the organization’s work there, so first of all, I take that as a really confident statement on my part. But when we look at the earnings, we looked at our own internal forecasts, that’s one of the reasons we told you that our first quarter was only slightly better than our own internal forecasts and plans. We thought that was important. We had some tailwind items in the quarter that we do not expect to continue later in the year and we think they are important enough that you shouldn’t get so bullish based on the earnings in the first quarter to extrapolate that out for the rest of the year, and just to give you some of those examples -- diesel fuel, you already commented on that you saw that, but look at retail fuel margins. We talked specifically about that and in the second or third quarter, retail fuel margins will be less this year by quite a little bit than they were last year, in our opinion. Commodity costs, we think that there will be some swing back in those that take some of the tailwind out of the first quarter into the remainder of the year. And then on the economy and the customer uncertainty, we see that actually as continuing through the year. I don’t see that getting worse. I’m not sure I see it getting better. We don’t see any particular signs of it getting better but that is sort of steady as it goes. And then of course, LIFO, which we’ve already talked about. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Certainly on the economy we are seeing things stabilize and in a few areas seeing a little bit better but not much. When we say a little, I mean, it really is a little. 
J. Michael Schlotman: Karen, I think Dave’s comment about relative to our internal expectations is one of the important factors here as well. When you look at our internal expectations compared to the consensus estimates for the year by the quarter, really what we are saying is the first quarter consensus was well below our internal expectations, although the year for the consensus was within our range. And if you are wondering where we think you are too high, I would point to the fourth quarter. 
Karen Short - FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Actually, I mean, I got -- the list that you just gave makes sense to me. I guess when I think of fuel margins, you already knew that fuel margins were unusually high last year and so you factored a normalized fuel margin into your guidance for the current year, so I guess I don’t count that necessarily as unusual. But looking to fuel margins a little bit, I guess I’m curious -- I think on one call, you had kind of given some directional impact on the impact on earnings from a change in margins and I can’t remember what quarter it was but I kind of got that about $0.01 change in gas margins year over year was about a six-tenths of a cent in earnings. So I guess the first question is can you tell me if that’s kind of directionally right? And then the second question is with margins very unpredictable, I guess I’m curious how quickly you can react to strong or weak gas margins as it relates to the rest of your promotional programs? Meaning if you are suddenly seeing really strong gas margins, can you accelerate a promotional program within that period so that there’s kind of a neutralizing effect, or do the reverse if margins are suddenly much weaker?
David B. Dillon: While Rodney and Mike are looking up what comments they want to make on the impact that you were asking initially, but let me talk about the fuel margins and our other margins. It would be incorrect to say that we view them as independent of each other but it would also be incorrect to say that we try to make up or get back any change in gas margins and visa versa. Gas margins change every day and that’s one of the reasons we say that the liquid gas margins, you need to look at least a full-year run and I even think longer term is even better than that, but certainly looking at four quarters gives you a much better sense of where gas margins can be. And on any way of measuring, last year on a four-quarter basis was much higher than what we have historically experienced and what we expect to experience going forward.  So if we see in a given week or a given month or a given quarter that gas margins are higher or lower than what our expectations are, certainly it will influence what we do elsewhere in our business but it’s not going to -- we’re not going to let it whip-saw where we go because we are directionally a focus on what our customers want and we don’t want to change that model just because of one month or two months of gas margins, one direction or another.  So I don’t think I’d [be too direct here by that] -- now I realize that the gas margins were forecasted for the whole year and it did enter into the guidance we gave for the whole year but I think it helps explain why our first quarter internal estimates were about on-target for the guidance that we’ve given you and I think it helps explain why when the street had a lower expectation for the first quarter, why you shouldn’t go add the extrapolation of that performance into the second, third, and fourth quarter because in the second and third quarter, the gas margins aren’t going to be there this time. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The other thing I would add, I think your number would be reasonably close. The thing that we all have to remember is that part of it will be a function of what the retail price of gas is, because so much of gas is bought on credit card. If gas is at $3.50 or $4 a gallon, the interchange fee that we are paying to the credit card companies is a lot higher than if gas is at $2 a gallon, so that would be the one thing that would cause your number to be off as much as 20% or 30% either direction, depending on what the retail price is. 
J. Michael Schlotman: You also have to figure out what gallon growth is doing because the amount of gallons we sell could affect your calculation relative to the effect on net income. 
Karen Short - FBR Capital Markets: Right, got it, okay. And sorry, last question, any status on the conversations with the S&P as it relates to your ratings? And I guess any progress on how they look at the under-funded, multi-employer plans?
David B. Dillon: I’ll let Mike answer that. 
J. Michael Schlotman: There’s no net new news out of the rating agencies, which in this environment is good news, I would say. They continue to ask a lot of questions about the under-funded liability. We continue to help educate them significantly on it and as we go throughout the year, hopefully market returns help some. As we said in the prepared comments, both rising health care costs in the country and this under-funded pension liability is going to have to be something that works out at the bargaining table. 
Karen Short - FBR Capital Markets: Right. Okay, thanks very much. 
J. Michael Schlotman: The other thing is we think it’s very important to be as transparent as we can on what that under -- potential under-funding to be and that’s one of the reasons why we’ve shared it for several years and we continue to have the dialog with all the rating agencies to make sure they understand that and make sure they understand our plan on working to address, too. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Scott Muschkin representing Jefferies & Company.
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: I’m sorry, I’m in the car, hopefully you guys can hear me but I just wanted to reclarify Karen’s last thought process there, her first question -- is your confidence the same, increased or decreased regarding your $2.00 to $2.05 number guidance?
David B. Dillon: I’d say about the same. I don’t know, Mike or Rodney, if you feel any different. I don’t see it -- I certainly don’t feel more confident but I don’t feel less confident about it, so I’d have to say about the same, yeah. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Okay, that’s great. And then the second question, getting back to I think it was the first question about acquisitions -- can you guys just refresh us, if we were going to make some -- you know, we’ve done a lot of tuck-in, kind of in-market acquisitions but if you were going to do something bigger, kind of what your parameters are for that? And do you think prices for something larger are working their way down or not really?
David B. Dillon: Rodney, do you want to comment on that?
W. Rodney McMullen: In terms of overall, as we’ve said many times, any time when we look at something, merging with somebody that would be a new market, we’re looking for somebody that has a high quality asset base with strong market share, great people, and a culture similar to what we have. And we think that is just absolutely critical, any time that we merge with somebody on a bigger scale. If you look at our merger with Fred Myer, if you look at our merger with J.C. -- any of those companies, they all fit those parameters. So anytime we would go into a new market, those are things that are the first things that we look at and that we have to check off. And then we’d have to make sure we get comfortable in terms of the sustainability of their business model and what they have.  So those are things that we would continue to look at, always have and always will, and it’s a characteristic of every deal that we’ve participated in. And we also look to see what does the party bring to us and we think that’s what creates our merger. If you look at what Dillon, when we merged with them many years ago, they brought a lot of things to Kroger. If you look at Fred Myer, there’s many, many things that Fred Myer brought to Kroger. If you think about our three-tier corporate brand program, you think about our marketplace store, you think about our price impact store -- all those are things that Fred Myer had that brought to us. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: And of course it brought Dave to you guys too, right?
W. Rodney McMullen: Absolutely. And Joe [Piccler], two for one. 
David B. Dillon: That was a two-fer. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: How about the [inaudible] large type of acquisition? Do you think it’s improving? Do you think prices are becoming more realistic? Do you think the pressures that are coming to bear on the market are making things more likely or less likely? 
W. Rodney McMullen: I don’t think the trend really has changed on that, and as you know, we look at a lot of things but we don’t do a whole lot, so -- we want to make sure that it is the right one but I don’t see that this environment really changing that much. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: And one final one, if I could, obviously -- I think it was 48 days [at this point] to selling gross margin investment, kind of large, offset by a lot of great things that were happening. Where do you think your ability going forward if those things -- and this has been asked before but I mean, what do you think your ability is to continue that type of investment the rest of the year with what you know today?
David B. Dillon: Well, I think the investment varies a little bit by the -- maybe a lot, actually -- by the opportunities that we see and -- but directionally, and I tend to look at this more on an annual basis, directionally we expect to continue to invest in our selling gross by investing in pricing but we also expect, and have even in this last quarter, invested in other things that are not price, things that improve the other three keys -- people, the shopping experience, and the products keys. We’ve invested in each of those in the quarter too. Now in this environment, we’ve invested a little bit more on price than -- disproportionately than you might have otherwise done in a normal economy but I think all of them are important. So I expect that we’ll continue that trend through the year and we have a number of things in mind, we have a number of things we’ve put in motion in the first quarter which we think will play out well for the rest of the year. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Perfect. Thanks, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Sorry for the background noise. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate your comments when you were talking about the bias towards debt reduction and away from share buy-backs, and I guess what I’m wondering is you’ve got some short-term debt on the balance sheet but you also have a fair bit of cash. So with all that, it seems like borrowing costs have really come down lately so I’m wondering if you can talk about your views on potentially tapping the debt capital markets to term out some of that short-term debt?
J. Michael Schlotman: Some of that short-term debt, if you look at what’s there, there was a piece of debt that matured June 1, which would be in the short-term category on our balance sheet. I think it was about $360 million or so, which if you recall back last fall, we did a debt offering and said that that was really pre-funding that opportunity. We have paid that off. We did not do an incremental borrowing to do that, so relative to our overall cash position, that would come out of that.  You also have to keep in mind if you look at the cash, there was about $460 million on the balance sheet, so a large chunk of that got used up at the beginning of June when we paid that note off. 
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And if you can talk kind of big picture, if you -- what signs are you looking for that will make you a little more comfortable going away from debt reduction to share buy-backs? And I understand that I am a debt guy so it may seem odd for me to be asking that but it seems like your balance sheet is in very good shape, so I’m just kind of wondering what signs you are looking for from the economy or from the capital markets to get you a little more comfortable going back to share buy-backs?
J. Michael Schlotman: From a capital market standpoint, I feel comfortable with our ability to access the capital markets when we need to. Clearly from -- if you look forward to our bank credit facility maturing in November of 2011, so that means sometime this time next year, we’ll be sitting down and renegotiating that facility, it would be great if we were a triple B flat with all three agencies so we had broader -- so we had access to the A2P2 commercial paper market versus the unrated commercial paper market. That would change our view of our ability to get day-to-day liquidity. While it looks like the ability to do a larger bank deal is better today than it was six months ago, it’s still uncertain how big it could be, how long it will be, what it will cost, and how many banks will be, so there’s still a little bit of caution, in our view. We also think we need to improve our credit metrics. Keep in mind the net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio we talk about is the one that’s contained in our bank facility. It’s not necessarily the one the rating agencies use because it doesn’t capitalize the rents and it doesn’t contemplate the multi-employer pension funds. Obviously the way they do it would have gotten better as well.  So all of those are in the background. I do think that one of the things we have to keep in mind is absolute debt doesn’t necessarily have to go down as EBITDA grows and we reduce debt a little bit, that obviously -- what we are really fixated on more than anything is the absence of leverage ratio, not the absolute dollar amount of debt necessarily, but we do want to have a better ratio. 
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, that’s helpful. And just one follow-up -- Mike, it sounds like, you know, within the past couple of years, I’ve heard some frustration on your part, or maybe I just interpret it that way, with the rating agencies. It sounds like you are renewing a commitment to really try and work toward that mid triple B from S&P. Am I interpreting that correctly?
J. Michael Schlotman: We think in this environment, it would be very helpful for us to be A2, P2, F2 and be able to access that commercial paper market rather than the unrated market. I think we’ve had the commitment all along. Obviously the thing that’s been the wildcard in this is the amount of the un-funded [inaudible] obligation or the estimate of the amount that they are under-funded by, even though it’s not a direct obligation. And as Rodney said, we do believe in the transparency of putting that number out there and it’s bounced all around the place and the size of it right now is probably the thing that was more of a headwind than we would have estimated two years ago. 
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. Have a good day. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Neil Currie representing UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS: Good morning. I just want to talk about eating at home trends and how you are benefiting from people eating out at restaurants less. Obviously private label tends to move up during tough times and tends to be quite sticky. Do you think we may be able to see that in private -- in eating at home trends and people eating out at restaurants and shopping at supermarkets more as the economy does level out or maybe shows some improvement, that some of this market share growth from restaurants that you might be seeing could be sticky?
David B. Dillon: Well, I believe that that would be correct. We are still seeing the trend of families eating a little less at restaurants and a little more from us. Part of that is driven simply by where they can get the less expensive meal and part of it is driven by improvements that we’ve made in our own deli and meals that are ready to take home and eat, the combination of which -- I mean, we’ve commented that bakery/deli was one of the areas that has improved in sales above our average and that’s been true now for some time. That’s a reflection of the better job that we are doing.  Now, on the flip side, restaurants are doing actually a better job in trying to develop more of their pick-up meals at the restaurants to take home, trying to get some lower priced point items. Those I think could get a little bit of traction but I still don’t expect any big change here, other than the continued trend. And as the recession ends and the economy improves, because of the improved quality job we’ve done in our delis, I fully expect to retain some of that -- maybe not all but I certainly expect to retain some, and the same would be true of the Kroger brand, just as you described. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The other thing, and this was the trend we thought we were seeing even before the economy slowed down, people are starting to eat at home more together as a family and when we do our research, customers certainly tell us they enjoy eating together as a family and there’s been quite a bit of research done where people that eat together as a family and Columbia did a great study on this, kids have a much lower rate of being involved in drugs or abusing alcohol and things like that. So we really think that was a fundamental trend going on, even outside of the economy. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Thanks, and obviously setting up the bottom end of the ladder when it comes to when people do eat out less or trade down, you are very much a high quality operator. However, while on the one hand you are gaining market share from restaurants, I presume that there are some customers who are going to super centers, dollar stores, limited assortment discounters. What’s your confidence that that trend won’t be sticky as the economy recovers and you can get back some of those shoppers who are really struggling financially and going, compromising some quality and going to lower end retailers?
David B. Dillon: Actually, it’s those trends that give me confidence in our sales going forward because it tells us that there’s opportunity and sales available out there that we could still be getting more. So actually I feel better about the fact that that data is there and the reason I am confident about that is I believe based on our own research that customers prefer to shop with us than in those other types of stores that you’ve described. And because they prefer to shop with us, we think that as we give them more and more reason to do so, even in this economy they will continue to do so and they will do it in growing numbers, and when the economy improves, we think that that improves our prospects even more.  So I’m pretty bullish from the perspective of what you were describing. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And as you’ll recall in the first -- year-end earnings call, we talked about it, that our market share last year grew by over 60 basis points and if you look at over the last four years, it’s 225 basis points for the sum of those years together.  Sure. Just a final one -- I noticed that you called out lower warehousing, cost of warehousing distribution and that you seem to call out as a part from the usual cost being lower, in terms of the some of the investments you’ve made in IT in recent years with regard to warehousing and distribution, we started to see that come through in terms of lower cost or is there something else that’s causing lower warehousing costs?
W. Rodney McMullen: It’s really a combination of lower costs from the investment and driving that plus process change in our existing facilities. It’s really both together. 
Neil Currie - UBS: Okay. Thanks very much. 
David B. Dillon: I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Thank you, gentlemen. Your final question will come from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.   
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Thanks for taking my question. Good numbers, congratulations. I would like to start by talking a little bit about a comment you made about if you see some inflation again, then something that was a tailwind in the first quarter might go away and you weren’t talking about fuel. I think you were talking about food inflation. Is it fair to say that the deflation you saw in some categories was actually beneficial to gross profit dollars? I think I’ve asked this question before but I’ll ask it again. 
David B. Dillon: Well, it really depends on the items. Let’s just take milk as an example. We do expect the cost of milk to go up a little bit in the end of the year from where it is now and I do not think it’s correct to say that that helped our gross margin dollars but we sold a lot more milk. But the dollar sales would have suffered a bit because it was down actually quite a little bit.  So if we end up with a little bit of inflation in milk going towards the end of the year, actually we’ll see the retails go up and I would actually anticipate maybe that makes a little bit more gross margin in that situation but that’s always a hard one to read. It depends completely on the competitive market.  And other areas that we were talking about, we called out manufacturing, who had a terrific result in the first quarter and it was partly because of the great job they are doing and the processes they are doing and the increase in tonnage that they were able to sell, but it also was driven in part by lower commodity costs and we are expecting some of that to change and as that changes, that does depress a little bit the profit that we were producing and manufacturing in the first quarter. 
W. Rodney McMullen: But we still expect outstanding results. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, still expecting a good year from them, yeah. I don’t know if that fairly answers your question. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Yeah, no, I think that’s helpful. I was just trying to understand what tailwinds exactly you thought would go away. 
W. Rodney McMullen: It was really those lower input costs for our plants. We called out that and the diesel fuel costs were below our own expectations. Those were the two major tailwinds in the first quarter that at this point are beginning to dissipate. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Thank you. Another question I have, I believe you said that you are putting a big investment program on the remodels or you have one in place, and I just want to confirm that you do look at it as kind of a push to do remodels, and also is there a point where you feel that you have done the push? You know, obviously you always have to do remodels but is there a point, and really I want to know is there a point at which you would see the CapEx come down?
David B. Dillon: Well, I look at remodels a little bit different than that. I don’t look at it as a one or two or three-year push. I look at it as more of an emphasis. We are getting good results on our remodels. We are pleased with what we are achieving with them but I actually think the pace with which we are doing it, I don’t see it reaching a point, for instance, at the end of next year where we sort of reduce that. I think we are going to be pushing remodels for some time and we’ve been emphasizing them now for what, the last two or three years, at least. And I just see that as we are getting better returns on those too, actually, then when you compare it instead to some of our other investments. And so it’s natural that we would emphasize those areas, so I don’t think it’s going to be something that you will see wind down in another year or two. I just think that that’s an important area for us to keep building. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And as Dave mentioned, our performance to budget continues to be very strong on the remodels. Obviously if that changed, that would cause us to look at it differently but as long as we are getting some strong returns on that investment.  The other thing, if you look at the number per year, you’ll see a much more measured pace and you won’t -- we haven’t splurged to try to do 400 in a year or 500 in a year. It’s really trying to balance it across periods of time. 
J. Michael Schlotman: If you do a couple hundred a year, it takes you over 10 years to touch every store and 10 years is probably too long for a lot of stores to go between remodels, so --
David B. Dillon: Yeah, we think it’s too long. 
J. Michael Schlotman: This kind of number is the range we need to be in. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay, got it. That makes sense. I wanted to ask you a question about the one market -- I don’t think you mentioned in a long time that any of your markets have negative comps. This time I think you said there was one market. And although this is going to be hard to break down, to what extent is that assumption to that market of the economic environment or to what extent is it a function of competitive environment? And those are related, but -- 
David B. Dillon: Well, let me offer three comments -- first, it is one division, it was only slightly negative. Second is that it is the result of both the environment, in my opinion, the environment, customer behavior, and competitive activity, both of those are playing in that particular situation, and so I actually wouldn’t make too big a deal of it because it was only slightly negative but we thought in fairness we’ve got to mention there was one. 
J. Michael Schlotman: And we mentioned that we had one in the fourth quarter as well. It happened to be different markets between the fourth and the first though. 
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then my final was just a housekeeping question -- we underestimated interest expense for the quarter. Do you have -- can you give us guidance for interest expense for the full year? And just maybe just understand a little bit about what would be driving interest expense at the moment?
J. Michael Schlotman: I wont update the guidance for that now but we’ll step back and look at addressing that when we file our 10-Q and give some clarity to what’s driving the interest expense. Is that fair enough?
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: That’s fair. That’s fine. Thank you very much. 
David B. Dillon: Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all. But before we sign off, I would like to share some thoughts with our associates who we encouraged to join us on this call today.  Thank you for your individual contributions to our results this quarter. In our industry, operating successfully in any environment is a challenge. Performing well in this current economy is remarkable. It’s clear your commitment to Customer First strategy continues to differentiate our family of stores from our competitors. I hear, see and experience great customer service in our stores every week. It is gratifying when others recognize it too. Recently, one of our exceptional associates in Nashville, Tennessee was featured in the local paper for her customer service skills and her commitment to the neighborhood where she works. Described by her store manager as the heart and soul of the Bellevue store, Joe Hughes has been working for Kroger since 1968. Everybody knows Mrs. Joe. “I just love my customers,” Mrs. Joe says. “I know some by first names, some by last name and some I know their faces and they know me. I see this store as a corner grocery that is involved in the community. They realize we are here for whatever they need.” Earlier this year, I had a chance to meet Mrs. Joe. She is a great example of the tone John Hackett, our Mid-South President, has set for the whole division. Mrs. Joe is Customer First at its best -- many small, simple acts of kindness practiced every single day that make customers want to return. I want to thank Mrs. Joe, the whole Bellevue store, and the entire team in our Mid-South division for all they do to create a great environment in our stores for our customers. I also want to thank all of our associates for the extra efforts you make every day on behalf of our customers. We appreciate all you do. That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Kroger fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. My name is Erica and I’ll be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Miss Carin Fike. You may proceed.
Carin Fike :  Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is continued in our SEC filings but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I will turn the call over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon:  Thank you Carin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me today to review Kroger’s fourth quarter and full 2008 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and outstanding results for the fiscal 2008. The Kroger team did a remarkable job throughout the year of consistently delivering results in an environment that was more difficult than we assumed when we set our original guidance. Our performance during the quarter was solid in an environment that was uncertain. Total sales were $17.3 billion compared to $17.2 billion for the same period last year. If you exclude fuel sales at our supermarkets and convenience stores, total sales increased 4.4% over the prior year. Keep in mind that the retail price of gasoline fell considerably in the past year. In fact, the average retail price of a gallon of gas sold at Kroger’s fuel outlets was 41% lower than it was in the fourth quarter a year ago. Our fourth quarter identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.8%. Several departments posted identical sales well above the company average including meat, grocery, nutrition, pharmacy, and deli bakery. Strong sales in these areas were tempered by continued slowness in sales of discretionary general merchandise.  We’re finding that customers are basing their purchasing decisions more on what they need versus what they want. And we are addressing their needs in a variety of ways. Our efforts to help customers and their families navigate this tough economy are driven by our Customer 1st Strategy. As a result, we offer customers a unique combination of values no other competitor can match.  We believe many of the same money saving strategies shoppers employed in 2008 will continue throughout 2009, including combining trips to save fuel; eating out less often at restaurants; choosing Kroger brands more often; entertaining at home; and using more coupons and food stamps. At Kroger we see these changing trends as opportunities and many of these opportunities play to our strengths. We have unique tools that enable us to identify and act on changes in consumer behavior more quickly than our competitors.  I want to update you on how we’re doing in a recessionary environment beginning with Kroger brands. Our customers recognize and appreciate the quality and value of our comprehensive store brands which today number more than 14,400 items. We leverage our manufacturing and procurement capabilities to innovate and introduce new items that add value for our customers. During the fourth quarter 27% of Kroger’s grocery sales came from our own brands and grocery unit sales of Kroger brands reached a record high of 35% of total grocery units. These results continue the exceptionally strong growth in Kroger brands we saw in the third quarter and as expected Private Selections exceeded $1 billion in 2008. Customers are increasingly turning to our premium line of products because of the value and high quality they offer. In addition, our Value brands enjoyed strong growth as well. Once again our $12.5 billion Kroger brand portfolio enjoyed strong year-over-year growth and fueled Kroger’s overall grocery volume growth in 2008. We continue to see our own brands as a strategic asset in growing our business in 2009 and beyond. Our Kroger brand portfolio has offerings that meet our customers varied needs and budgets. Also, we continue to drive cost savings made in any area of our business back into lower prices for our customers. Keeping prices low is one of the several key drivers of our identical supermarket sales. Our $4 generic program in pharmacy which includes 90 day supply for only $10 continues to drive growth in our pharmacy business. Our pharmacy teams consistently hear directly from customers how much they appreciate this value. Through this generic drug program Kroger customers have saved over $150 million this past year. Our fuel rewards programs offer additional value by giving customers discounts on gas as they shop in our stores, pharmacies and gift card malls and in 2008 Kroger customers saved more than $100 million on fuel through these programs. Even with gasoline closer to $2 a gallon, Kroger’s fuel rewards program offer customers a great value and thanks them for their loyalty. Kroger also made significant gains in market share in 2008. In the major markets we serve Kroger gained 61 basis points of additional market share according to the internal methodology we use to estimate market share. This is the fourth consecutive year Kroger has achieved significant market share gain. Over the past four years combined, Kroger’s share in our major markets has increased roughly 225 basis points. Rodney will offer more insight into market share gains in a few moments. I want to thank our associates in every store, every plant, every warehouse and every office for their role that they played in driving market share gains in so many of the markets that we serve. These gains are the direct result of our associates’ commitment to our Customer 1st Strategy. Moving now to our outlook for 2009, we are optimistic and at the same time cautious as we help our customers navigate through today’s challenging economy. We expect full year identical supermarkets sales growth of 3 to 4% without fuel in fiscal 2009. This guidance reflects our outlook for product cost inflation of 1 to 2% compared to our earlier forecast of 2 to 3%. Kroger is positioned well to win customers in 2009 and beyond. Now I’ll turn to Rodney for additional color on the quarter and the full year and our 2009 outlook. Rodney.
W. Rodney McMullen :  Good morning everyone. As Dave mentioned we are very pleased to deliver value to both our customers and shareholders during this difficult economic times. We firmly believe our ability to do so is the result of the sustainability of Kroger’s long term Customer 1st Business Strategy and our flexible business model. Our strategy, which is unlike any other operator in our industry, allows us to consistently deliver solid near term results for our shareholders. At the same time, it enables us to invest in Kroger’s future growth. Since it is a long term strategy, I plan to spend most of my time discussing Kroger’s full year 2008 results but first I’ll share some additional color on the quarter. Kroger’s fourth quarter net earnings were $349.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings of $322.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the same period last year. The strength of our core grocery business drove this solid year-over-year earnings growth. In the fourth quarter Kroger’s retail fuel operations had minimal impact on total earnings per share.  We did benefit from a LIFO charge that was $13 million lower than the same period last year.  Note that this lower year-over-year LIFO charge does not reflect lower food inflation rates. Rather it reflects the timing of LIFO expense recorded throughout 2008 compared to the timing in the prior year.  Heading into the fourth quarter we had a better understanding of the timing and the amount of the settlement related to a Visa-MasterCard lawsuit associated with interchange fees. This prompted us to accelerate certain planned 2009 price investments to offer customers additional value during the holidays. The after tax benefit of $11.7 million we realized in December is a result of this settlement offset the cost of these accelerated price investments. The net impact on Kroger’s fourth quarter results was not material. We believe these strategic investments improved customer loyalty to Kroger and will drive future sales growth. The Visa-MasterCard settlement did help our OG&A rates. Excluding the settlement amount, Kroger’s fourth quarter OG&A rate excluding fuel increased 9 basis points compared to the prior year. Better controls over wages and store supplies helped offset rising healthcare costs.  Turning now to Kroger’s full year 2008 results, we produced outstanding results. The full year identical sales growth of 5% without fuel is within the guidance we raised throughout the year. We are especially pleased to produce these results in such a tough economy. Kroger’s strong non-fuel identical sales growth contributed to strong earnings results. Today we reported fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.92 per diluted share, excluding expenses we incurred during the third quarter for damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ike. This exceeds the upper end of the guidance that we shared with you in December and represents a 13.6% growth over fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.69 per diluted share. On top of that earnings per share growth, Kroger’s quarterly dividend adds over 1% to total shareholder return. We met our earnings per share target for the year even though Kroger’s non-fuel operating margins did not expand slightly as we originally forecasted. Rather, our non-fuel operating margin declined 15 basis points, partially due to a $42 million year-over-year increase in LIFO expense which reduced Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin by 5 basis points. As we have discussed in earlier quarters this year, Kroger’s LIFO charge was driven by levels of food inflation that we’ve not experienced in almost 20 years. During the fourth quarter food inflation remained at these higher levels. Our estimated product cost inflation excluding fuel for the quarter was 5.9% with inflation in the grocery department approaching 8%. Many consumer products goods companies have not reflected lower commodity price costs in their pricing. As we’ve mentioned to you several times before, this represents an opportunity for Kroger brands to continue to gain share.  On an annual basis, Kroger’s FIFO gross margin excluding our retail fuel business declined 16 basis points. Supermarket selling gross margin declined 32 basis points. Improvements in shrink as well as warehousing and transportation expense funded a portion of our continued investment in lower prices for our customers. Kroger’s OG&A rate on a full year basis without fuel declined 3 basis points. Cost control across all areas of our business remains a priority for the company so we can continue to invest to improve our customers’ shopping experience. While LIFO was a headwind for the year, strong fuel margins, particularly in the second and third quarters of the year provided some offsetting tailwind. In the fourth quarter the cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers was $0.097 compared to $0.128 in the prior year. We continued to experience strong gallon growth both on an absolute and identical basis. On a rolling four quarter basis the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.147 this year compared to $0.114 for 2007. Our guidance for fiscal 2009 assumes a more normalized fuel margin of $0.11 per gallon as well as continued strong growth in gallons sold.  Kroger’s strong earnings results would not be possible without our prudent and balanced long term financial strategy. Kroger’s business generated $2.9 billion in cash from operations, an increase of $315.5 million over the prior year. We believe it is important to allocate cash flow to maximize its benefit for our fixed income and equity investors. During 2008 Kroger invested $2.15 billion in capital projects excluding acquisitions. Our return on assets measurement improved by 27 basis points. For 2009 we expect to invest $1.9 to $2.1 billion in capital projects, slightly less than 2008. Our emphasis on store remodel activity and infrastructure investments will continue. Our leverage metrics are also improving. On a rolling four quarter basis, Kroger’s net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.89 compared to 2.03 during the same period last year. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in net total debt, a decrease of $24 million from a year ago. Under current market conditions, our bias continues to be toward debt reduction and away from share buybacks. We believe this approach supports an appropriate level of liquidity and leverages Kroger’s financial strength to continue delivering on our Customer 1st plan. However, we did repurchase 451 thousand shares during the fourth quarter. This is from proceeds from employees’ stock option exercises. As market conditions change we’ll evaluate and adjust our buyback activity accordingly. At the end of the quarter we had $493 million under the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board in January, 2008. Kroger’s dividend program continues to reward shareholders. During fiscal 2008 Kroger paid $227 million in cash dividends to shareholders. This compares with $202 million in dividends paid during the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the current dividend yield on Kroger’s stock adds over 1% to total shareholder return. Dave outlined the significant gains in market share Kroger made in 2008 and I will offer some additional detail. These market share figures are based on an internal method we have used consistently for the past several years to calculate market share. This method considers the potential for sales in each market from all related retail outlets where customers can purchase products Kroger sells, including supercenters and other non-traditional retail formats such as Dollar Stores, drug stores and warehouse clubs. Most third party market share data providers which show that Kroger’s market share increased by a larger amount than our internal method indicates. At Kroger we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores.  We serve customers in 42 major markets. For 2008 Kroger held the number one or number two market share position in 39 of our 42 major markets. Kroger’s overall market share in these 42 major markets grew by 61 basis points during 2008 on a volume weighted basis. Kroger’s share increased in 36 of those 42 major markets and declined in 6. Kroger competes against a total of 1,418 supercenters, an increase of 78 over the last year. Supercenters have achieved at least a number three market share position in 35 of our major markets. Kroger’s overall market share in these 35 markets grew by 87 basis points during 2008 on a volume weighted basis. Our share increased in 30 of those 35 major markets and declined in five. Of the 1,418 supercenters that I mentioned 1,125 are operated by Wal-Mart, an increase of 60 over the last year. Wal-Mart Supercenters have achieved at least a number three share position in 33 of the major markets where Kroger faces significant supercenter competition. Kroger’s overall market share in these 33 markets rose 86 basis points in 2008. Our share increased in 29 of those 33 markets and declined in four. These are impressive market share results and they demonstrate that Kroger’s long term strategy is working. As population growth continues in the major markets where we operate, we intend to continue to grow Kroger’s business by maintaining our existing strong market share and by building on additional opportunities for sales growth. We calculate that approximately 45% of the share in our major markets, as much as $100 billion, is held by competitors who do not have Kroger’s economies of scale. We estimate that the market share of those competitors has declined about 1% of each of the last four years. We continue to look for ways to capture additional market share. Turning now to our outlook for fiscal 2009, we do believe that today’s challenging economic conditions will persist throughout 2009 and perhaps weaken further as unemployment rises in many parts of the country. Against this uncertain backdrop, forecasting is difficult. But as Dave said we are one of the best positioned retailers for these times. While many other retailers are forecasting flat or declining sales for 2009, we continue to believe Kroger’s connection with our customers will generate solid identical sales growth as we help customers feed their families. We have factored in two major variables into our sales outlook for fiscal 2009. The first is moderating food inflation. For fiscal 2009 we expect product cost inflation of 1 to 2%. This is significantly lower than the level of inflation we experienced throughout much of 2008. The second factor is the economy and the effect on consumer spending which Dave outlined for you earlier. Our full year forecast for identical sales growth in 2009 is 3 to 4% excluding fuel sales. This growth will be driven by the continued execution of our long term customer first blend.  Five weeks in 2009 our identical sales trend is within this guidance range. We expect the contribution of strong identical sales growth and expansion of Kroger’s operating margin, both excluding fuel sales, will produce full earnings of $2 to $2.05 per diluted share for fiscal 2009. We anticipate that the expansion of Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin will be larger than normal due to a significantly lower LIFO charge in 2009 compared to 2008. Our current forecast for LIFO expense in 2009 is $75 million which is $121 million lower than our 2008 LIFO expense. Excluding the benefit of lower LIFO expense in 2008, we expect a slight increase in operating margin for 2009.  The earnings benefit of lower LIFO expense will be offset somewhat by lower fuel margins in 2009. These offsetting items coupled with no significant reduction in Kroger’s outstanding share count reflects our belief that the underlying strength of Kroger’s core grocery business will drive the above market earnings per share growth implied by our 2009 earnings per share guidance. This growth, plus Kroger’s dividend, should generate a solid return for our shareholders particularly in today’s environment. Our 2009 guidance incorporates several other assumptions which we outlined in the 8-K we filed earlier today. I want to emphasize that Kroger is forecasting growth for both identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth for fiscal 2009, reflecting our commitment to creating value for our shareholders, bond holders and customers. Our continued growth also benefits our associates by creating job opportunities for them. Now that you know our expectations for the year, I want to give you an update on where we are regarding labor relations. In another sign that our business continues to grow as others retract, Kroger has added jobs in a time of rising unemployment. Our growing business created approximately 16,000 new jobs in 2008 bringing the total number of full and part time associates we employ to 326,000.  In 2009 we will negotiate agreements for store associates in Albuquerque, Arizona, Atlanta, Dallas, Dayton, Denver and Portland. Already this year we have completed successful contract negotiations in Roanoke, Virginia and Las Vegas.  One emerging and difficult issue on the labor front stems from the turmoil in the equity markets. Taft-Harley Pension Plans to which we contribute have experienced significant decline in the value of their assets. Inevitably this will lead to some reduction in future pension benefits and also increases in the contributions we make. In 2008 we contributed approximately $220 million to these pension funds. This amount is not expected to grow significantly in 2009 but over the course of the next several years contributions to pension plans are expected to increase.  Depending on how the market affects asset values as well as other factors, our annual contributions could easily double. The need to increase pension contributions will undoubtedly create a difficult environment to negotiate wages and benefits. Nevertheless, our objective in every negotiation is to achieve competitive cost structures in each market that helps us provide value to our customers and at the same time meet our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable healthcare. Our ability to balance competitive costs with associate benefits allows Kroger to invest in our business and create new job opportunities for existing and future associates. Before I turn it back to Dave, I want to take a moment to thank all our associates for delivering results this quarter and throughout the year in spite of the considerable challenges we faced. We appreciate the effort that our teams made in every part of our business. Customer 1st is not just something we talk about. It is part of what we do every day in every part of our company and I want to thank you for taking it so seriously. It clearly distinguishes us in 2008 and it will continue to keep us winning with customers as we navigate 2009 and beyond. Now I’ll turn it back over to Dave for some closing remarks.
David B. Dillon :  Thanks Rodney. Before we take your questions I want to offer some additional thoughts on what we’re seeing so far this year. Though shoppers are more cautious than they were even three months ago we remain optimistic about 2009. It is clear customers are relying on Kroger because they trust us to deliver low prices, great quality products, friendly service and a pleasant shopping experience, all of which continue to improve. We understand what customers need in this environment better than others and we offer an overall value proposition that meets their changing needs. We look forward to continuing to deliver value to our customers and shareholders in 2009. Now we’d be happy to take a few moments for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  Just a couple questions on expense control opportunities. I know you talked about that a bit on your last call and you had some time to kind of put some more thought to it so I’m wondering if you could give a little more color on what you think the opportunity is from you know a dollar perspective and when you think we could expect to see some progress.
David B. Dillon:  I’ll be happy to. I won’t give you a specific dollar amount as a target but I will tell you that in the fourth quarter we saw clear improvement and I’m feeling much better about where we are on our expense control. And it may not on the numbers that we’ve given you it may not at first appear that way. If you look at our OG&A for the quarter we declined 3 basis points I believe and if you adjusted that for Visa-MasterCard it would have been flipped the other direction. We recognize that you have to think of it that way but what’s not included in OG&A and it’s the hazard of the way in which accounting records are kept, we tend to look at total costs as total costs. And so we look at shrink and warehousing and advertising and transportation and all of those, too.  And we did indicate and you can see the difference between our selling gross and our FIFO gross. That essentially represents – not entirely I suppose but it’s essentially the improvement we made in warehousing, transportation and shrink. Those numbers combined with what we did in OG&A is meaningful progress from the third quarter. So that’s the basis of my optimism. Now as we look forward, though, we have worked on and did see in the quarter and expect to see this year better control of expenses.  We do expect to have healthcare issues that are problematic. What’s driving the healthcare by the way is we have more people on our plan. We’ve mentioned that we’ve added employees. We’re growing our business. We have more people, more lives covered. Turnover is a little less and with lower turnover you have more people eligible for the healthcare that we offer. That gives you more people with lives covered. The utilization of healthcare is up a bit and we’ve had some unfortunate catastrophic events, both in the third and fourth quarters. So the healthcare numbers are as I said problematic. But expense control generally I think is making good progress. We’re seeing of course in a lot of the supply areas that are affected by fuel, [bag] costs and some of those kinds of areas. We’re starting to see some improvement there. And then finally and maybe most important for the long run is we have over the last couple of years begun implementing some process change improvements that we think improve – that they do improve productivity and our objective is clearly to save money on those items in places that really don’t matter to the customer, to invest it in areas like prices but other investments in the other keys as well that do matter to the customer. So that’s the reason, Karen, that I’m optimistic and actually feel pretty good about the progress we made in the fourth quarter and expect even more in 2009.
W. Rodney McMullen :  Looking forward I think all of us see more opportunities and it’s just a matter of prioritizing those and actually executing against those. But certainly no lack of excitement in terms of opportunities that we see.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  And then, just wondering if you have any comments or color on divisions geographically that are performing exceptionally well. Were all divisions positive from an [ID] perspective?
David B. Dillon:  We’re not going to give individual numbers for divisions or for regions, but I think it would not surprise you. Maybe a couple of things to note on sales would not surprise you that we had certain parts of the country that are harder hit in the economy whose sales would have suffered a little bit more. Those were problematic. And as we mentioned the discretionary general merchandise kinds of products were harder hit in the fourth quarter too.  And in fact if you want to think about sales just for a minute, our biggest division for non-foods would be Fred Meyer and so we did just a little math to look and see how impactful were some of the discretionary general merchandise categories. And if you take just Fred Meyer’s business and take the discretionary general merchandise out, and that’d be most of the non-food. It would not exclude the health and beauty care for instance but it would include most of the non-food that they sell and they are a big seller of this merchandise.  The change in that business, if you take that out of our fourth quarter, it would have increased our [idents] without fuel about 40 basis points. So our results would have been about 4.2% without fuel instead of the 3.8. So I guess what I’m trying to describe is that our sales were clearly impacted by specific kinds of things but we saw good signs of progress in sales in the quarter in many of the departments and most of the divisions. We called out specifically meat, grocery, nutrition, pharmacy, deli bakery. Those were all doing very well and better than what our averages were.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: And then just lastly –
W. Rodney McMullen :  Karen – Karen before you move on just – Dave may throw something at me, but 17 of our 18 divisions were positive. And the one that was not was only slightly negative so it was pretty broad across the whole country.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  Okay. Great.
David B. Dillon:  I guess Rodney’s a softie. I wasn’t going to tell you that.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  And then just the last question is do you have any comments on the like on EPS – cadence of EPS, consensus EPS throughout the year? I mean obviously the growth rate isn’t totally even. Just wondering if you had any thoughts.
David B. Dillon:  Rodney, do you have any insight into that? Mike? You might need to repeat that question. I’m not sure I understood it fully, Karen.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  Well I was just wondering from a growth rate perspective as you look through first quarter through the fourth quarter earnings growth rate perspective, do you have any color on maybe some quarters being lower or higher.
David B. Dillon:  For ’09 going forward?
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  Yes.
David B. Dillon:  Okay. I misunderstood. I thought you were looking back to ’08.
W. Rodney McMullen:  It should be a lot smoother this year than last year. I wouldn’t expect wide variances between any one quarter from our average annual growth rate. There were a couple of things that affected ’08 that can make ’09 difficult to compare to, the timing of our LIFO expense as well as the fuel margins in the third quarter can make that a little bit softer than the rest of the year. But overall it should be relatively steady and not wild variations off of that mean.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse:  Could you maybe discuss the cadence of your ID’s throughout the quarter and then into February and March? And did you see any improvement from sort of December, January into February, early March? And maybe could you break that out by traffic and ticket?
David B. Dillon:  Yes. I’ll give you a little color onto that. Through the quarter as we progressed into the holidays our sales growth – the rate of sales growth declined just a little bit so that the Christmas, the month of December was a little worse. We don’t do it exactly in months but we do it in periods. But the month of December was a little bit worse than where we trended in November and the month of January trended a little bit less than where we did in December. If you look then at the month of February – now I’m just taking four weeks instead of five weeks, we had some improvement. And the reason I’m taking the four weeks instead of five weeks is last week which would have been the fifth week had some weather affect last year that could screw the data up a little bit in terms of understanding what it means.  But the picture I wanted to give you is that in through the holidays and immediately following the holidays it’s our view that the consumer was more cautious and I think that showed itself in our sales. In February we saw a modest improvement – I won’t say slight, but a modest improvement. And so there was some regaining I think of confidence perhaps in how they were approaching spending. But you can see with us giving you the guidance we did on ID sales that we think two things are occurring. One is the customer as we go into this year is more cautious. And second is that our view of inflation is a little bit lower than what we had given in December. Both of those are quite relevant.  As to the back end of your question about average sale and number of visits, we’re actually seeing - in our actual store data, we’re seeing an increase in traffic and we are seeing an increase in the average sale and this is the fourth quarter, increase in traffic and an increase in average sale but the increase in average sale per customer per transaction is actually at a lower rate than what we had been experiencing before. If you look at our data, our customer loyalty data, what we’re seeing is an increase in the number of loyal shopping households and among the loyal shopping households we’re seeing them shop more often with us. Even though the number of items that they may buy in any one trip is not increasing particularly, the number of trips per household is. So that’s an overall picture and then when you add in the four weeks that I described February where we seem to have picked up a bit in the sales, it gives me the feeling that the consumer is not quite as cautious as we saw in December but still nonetheless perhaps more cautious than they were throughout ’08.
W. Rodney McMullen:  I think the other thing that’s difficult to say that during the holidays there was five less shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and that certainly created some swings that we wouldn’t normally see. And how much of that effected the overall sales results is hard to say.
David B. Dillon:  Yes. That’s a good point Rodney.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse:  Now you had mentioned that you’re current ID’s are running in line with the full year guidance that you’ve given. I would imagine that the lower inflation that we’re going to see is much more back half weighted so does that mean that traffic has to get better in the back half for you to continue with that rate? Is that how we should view that?
David B. Dillon:  I don’t think I would view it that necessarily traffic has to get better but I think our overall business whether – we look at households. And we need to grow more households and we need to grow what those households buy from us. And if we do that, then we’ll be just fine. Now whether it shows up in more traffic or whether it shows up in more purchases per visit is hard to say.  Part of that depends upon gas pricing for instance. I think one of the reasons that we’re seeing a few more visits right now than we did before was that gas prices are now under generally under $2 a gallon. Where when it was well over that I think people were even trying to, you know, one week shopping trips kind of thing. Stock up at a point. But now they’re a little bit more willing to come in. And of course with the gas at our stores it helps them, too. But it’s a little hard to read. So I would not put it all on just more transactions going forward.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse:  You know there’s a number of things taking place on the gross margin side this year that should help. I mean just less inflation, increased private label, maybe even more promo dollars from vendors. How should we think about the implications of each of these on your non-fuel margin? And what’s the probability that these benefits get reinvested back into lower selling prices?
David B. Dillon:  Well, we’re going to balance of course what ends up being our gross margin by what we can on one hand gain on some of the issues that you described; selling more Kroger brand as one of the examples that you gave. With what we can save in lower cost of product we’re going to take those savings and we’re going to look to what we do in our OG&A and our other costs, the shrink and the advertising and warehouse and transportation. And then we’re going to determine how much of that can be reinvested and where. Certainly in this environment a reasonable amount of that gets reinvested in price because this is an environment where price is more important. But that’s not the only key that we’re dealing with. We also have the other three keys and we’re investing in all four keys during the year. And it is our intent to look at the guidance the way we gave it which is the margins will improve a little. In fact, they have to, given how much we got from gasoline this past year. But beyond that our hope is to save enough money to then invest further in those keys in ways that will drive our sales further.
Operator:  Your next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Dave, quick question. What happens to private label sales and margin as your commodity costs come down, you know, to you which should be happening just about now? You know, what do you think happens to market share and margin with private label products?
David B. Dillon:  It depends on a lot of things, John, because our improvements in Kroger brand, this strong tailwind that we’re experiencing in Kroger brand really is riding on at least three really important factors. And only some of those factors are affected by what you describe. So let me describe those and maybe come back to your question.  They’re affected by the better approach we have to branding. We’ve talked two years ago at least, maybe even three, about the fact that we were going to focus more on how we branded our Kroger brands. We’ve approached that from a quality aspect, from a better marketing and packaging aspect. We’ve broadened the selection of our products, the introduction of our Value brand, which as we’ve indicated has had excellent results especially in this time. That better approach to branding we think gives us better sales regardless of where the economic environment is, regardless of what happens to inflation.  The second big area of course is the economy. It’s made customers a little more willing perhaps to try products that they view as providing better value. That part, the economy, is forecasted this whole year to stay difficult for our customers. And so I would expect that they will keep on increasing the trial rate of Kroger brands.  And then finally what will the national brand companies do on their pricing? And we’ve seen some price declines but we’ve seen lots of commodity cost declines where there has not been a respective cost decline of the base product by the national brands. And if that continues very long, the price differential between our Kroger brand products and the national brands will continue even higher. Our growth in tonnage in the quarter in grocery in particular was all driven by Kroger brands. The national brands were basically flat or slightly down in tonnage. And there may have been a few brands that were up, but on the whole it’s the Kroger brand story. And that’s going to continue as long as that kind of price differential exists and as long as we keep handling our brand with the professional way that we’ve learned how to do.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  So as your input costs come down, you’ll reflect that in retail pricing so the gap in pricing will widen versus the brands, assuming they don’t do anything. Does there come a point where the price elasticity of that, if you open up too wide a gap you know you’re better off booking some of that as margin? Or you never get to that point?
David B. Dillon:  I think it’ll be item by item. We will not make a blanket statement that every cost improvement in product cost of Kroger brands will be reinvested to lower prices. But generally speaking that will be our intention. And as we go down the path, if we see some products that actually don’t improve and it’s in the sales by lowering the price then we would argue ourselves that we ought to keep that margin and instead invest that margin in something else that does matter to the customer. So I think we’ll balance that out in a way that you’d be pleased with actually. But I think it will also be one that will continue to drive Kroger brand sales.
W. Rodney McMullen:  Our divisions and merchants will actually look at that analysis on an item by item basis and make that call about you know is it something that we can gain share? You know, what produces the best result?
David B. Dillon:  Yes.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Do you still think that we’ll see from the branded guidance more of an increase in trade spend as opposed to shelf price roll backs? Is that still the most likely outcome here?
David B. Dillon:  Well, I’m speculating but that would be my opinion, yes. 
W. Rodney McMullen:  Short term.
David B. Dillon:  Yes, short term.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  And then finally, what are you seeing on the acquisition opportunity front? A lot of people have to be suffering, a lot of your competitors. It’s a buyers market. Are there a lot of in market opportunities that you’re seeing today?
David B. Dillon:  It really hasn’t changed as much as what we would have guessed. And it’s kind of fascinating. And the couple that we would be in discussions, people still have valuation views that are too high for the market. But at some point that will change, but so far not as much as I would have guessed.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  And then would your – let’s say those opportunities come up, that would be incremental to your CapEx or might replace portions of the CapEx?
David B. Dillon:  If you look at it historically normally it’s probably half to two-thirds incremental and a third to half replacing. Because like in Cincinnati a few years ago when we acquired some stores, some of the stores that we acquired from Winn-Dixie were sites that we had wanted and had in our plan and it replaced that site. But still even with that said we still remodeled the store and some other things. So as a general rule if you look at it historically I would say it’s probably more half and half, John.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Neil Currie – UBS.
Neil Currie – UBS:  I wonder if I can ask about the competitive environment out there. Obviously given the economy it’s going to be very competitive. But you’ve been pretty much on the front foot now for a good four or five years in terms of reinvesting productivity gains. How more rapidly are you doing that? It doesn’t seem that you’re being irrational although the competition is being irrational even if competitions stepped up a bit. What’s your views on potentials for price wars?
David B. Dillon:  Well, I tend to think that the industry compared to say 30 or 40 years ago has gotten very rational and it’s because every quarter we have these calls and have to explain what it is we’ve done. And I think that’s a helpful thing for us to have to do. As you can tell from even the discussions we’ve had already this morning, all the choices we make are made from a clear business perspective, from a long term strategy perspective, and it maybe gets to your point of how we reinvest on productivity. Our objective is to do this on a steady basis.  As we expect to have savings over time every year, year-in and year-out, and we expect to have places that we can invest that savings and places that is meaningful to our customer, year-in and year-out. We don’t expect to do it all in one year, either the cost savings or the reinvestment. We expect to do it over time for the long pull. So we’re in this for a very long process. We’re not in this for what it will produce tomorrow or next week or even next quarter. And I think that produces a different kind of action on our part at least and as a result I think we’ve shown ourselves to be very rational and my judgment of the market is it continues to be rational. It is a bit more competitive in that the economy when it turned a bit south and as the year progressed it got progressively worse in the customer’s mind in terms of how cautious the customers were. And as a result that does cause people to have some concern over sales. But actually I think maybe you should take some encouragement from the fact that our sales guidance is what it is. We’re not guiding sales that are unreasonable to achieve, given the strengths that we offer in the market. And so you’re not going to see us as a result try to do something irrational in order to achieve it.
Neil Currie – UBS:  Just on that guidance and also the performance of sales in the fourth quarter, if you would just strip out the moderating inflation which you’re managing sort of quite neutrally it seems, so it shouldn’t be too much of an impact on the bottom line. And also the increase in private label sales you’re seeing which should be a positive for the bottom line that you can either reinvest or do what you like with. What would you say the tonnage, you know not just private label but overall, what’s the – how much change has there been in the volume growth of the business over the past quarter and what you’re expecting for this coming year? Would you say that you’re still assuming a fairly steady volume performance on an underlying basis or with the economy some moderation?
David B. Dillon:  I feel that our tonnage if you think – tonnage is hard to track, but let me just talk generally about say grocery as a category. I believe that we will keep increasing our grocery tonnage. And in the food categories I’m a lot more comfortable in making this statement than if I included also the drug GM. But if I look at the food categories like food – or like grocery, produce, meat, bakery, deli, those kind of categories; nutrition, I’m very comfortable that we did grow – modestly grew our tonnage, continued to in the year. I actually think maybe the tonnage available in this area is a little bit less if you look at the pie, it’s maybe shrinking a hair in that customers are buying even some discretionary food items a little less often than they were.  But I’m feeling pretty good about our ability to have captured some growth. I look forward into the next year and I think in ’09 that it’s going to be more of the same. I don’t expect ’09 to change much although the rate of inflation may change, I don’t expect the economy or the consumer outlook to change very much. And that’s why I have that outlook. Rodney you may have a different view.
W. Rodney McMullen:  Well, I was just going to say as Dave mentioned it’s hard to get a good handle on tonnage because there’s so many moving parts. But the way we would measure it internally we actually feel like the fourth quarter tonnage growth was better than both the second and third quarter. So it was the best when you look at the last three quarters from a tonnage growth standpoint. Now some of that is because as you mentioned, you know, if we mentioned about the private label so if you look at the average ring per item, there’s been some decline in certain categories.
Neil Currie – UBS:  Just on that comment on inflation as well, obviously that will impact the dollar growth of in store sales in 2009, but philosophically does that really matter if you’re managing your costs reasonably well enough? And isn’t in fact a lower inflation environment or even deflationary environment better for your customers, better for demand and better for you to manage than a sort of rampant inflationary environment?
David B. Dillon:  Well, our objective is to make inflation basically neutral anyway. And the only time that we’ve not really been successful to do that is when it’s quickly erratic, when you have some radical change in cost up or down, you know. And we’ve had a little bit of that in the last two years but not a lot of that. But generally speaking we try to neutralize that, so whether inflation is going up or going down I think we can probably do that. I’ve tended to believe that in periods of modest inflation that that’s a net net, slight positive for us. But I don’t particularly think that the reverse corollary is true, that to have less inflation or to have deflation that is necessarily negative, although we’re not forecasting deflation either. That’s not our expectation.
W. Rodney McMullen:  There’s just a few categories where we’ve actually had some pretty meaningful deflation in them and the tonnage growth in those categories is amazing, and gross profit dollars have actually improved. So what is it? Economists always say all short statements are wrong, and I certainly think you can’t just look at deflation and assume it’s bad for the business.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Unidentified Analyst] - Jefferies & Co.
Unidentified Analyst - Jefferies & Co.:  Just two questions. First on the vendor relationships, I mean you’ve talked around it somewhat but I mean I’ve got to imagine that you may be pushing some vendors that got aggressive with price increases over the last year pretty hard at this stage. Could you talk to that a little bit?
David B. Dillon:  Sure. We have a lot of active dialog with our vendors. But I would characterize our relationships with our vendors as outstanding and I would characterize what we have as working partnerships with our national brand vendors and expect to have that continue. We do push back a bit on price increases and we push back on the failure of prices to decline when the underlying costs have declined. But ultimately we’re pushing back on behalf of our customers, not on our behalf. Because our intent is just as when costs rise we’re passing those along in retails, as costs decline we would expect that those would generally not individually but generally would be passed back to the customer, too. So we’re sort of the proxy for the customer in this regard. But as a business, though, we’re quite happy in either scenario because our Kroger brand, one of the three factors that I said was driving our Kroger brand was the pricing position that the national brands have taken on some of the categories that are strong for us in Kroger brand. Well, if that continues then so much more we gain on our Kroger brand and our customers love that. So we’re happy in that event but we’re also happy in the other direction. So I would – I think it’s wrong to characterize this as a tug-of-war between retailers and the national brand vendors. I just don’t think that’s the way to think about this. I think it’s a question of dealing with customers on our part and dealing with customers on the part of the national brand companies.
W. Rodney McMullen:  You know, we’ve always looked at it that the customer should be the one deciding what product that they buy, whether it’s the Kroger brand or the national brand. And you know we’re not trying to skew the customer one way or the other, other than trying to make sure we give them the best value we can give them.
[Unidentified Analyst] - Jefferies & Co.:  To that I mean obviously we’ve seen a huge increase here in private label penetration and I have to imagine that you’ve given some thought to allocating shelf space a little differently – I mean I understand where you’re coming from, that you’re speaking on behalf of the customer. But obviously the customer has to have the option to buy different items. I mean, where would you see this private label penetration potentially going, assuming that we stay relatively in the same environment that we’re in right now?
David B. Dillon:  We have with occasional changes in quarter-to-quarter but on the whole for the last 20 years or so we’ve steadily improved our private label penetration every year, year after year after year after year. We expect that trend to continue. 2008 was a stronger year than we had expected or had seen in past years. I would expect actually ’09 to be strong, too. I’m looking forward to it being strong. But again I don’t see this as a tug-of-war, just private label versus national brand.  We change our shelf sets really every week and not every item every week, but categories are changing every week. And we readjust them based on sales and what customers want to buy from those sets. Sometimes it’s expanding – it is always expanding some items and it’s always contracting some items. And sometimes those items that are expanded are Kroger brand, more often lately they’ve been Kroger brand, but sometimes they’re national brands, too. And sometimes we contract on Kroger brand. We let the customer actually ultimately decide that.
[Unidentified Analyst] - Jefferies & Co.:  And final question, just a quick one. Obviously the competitive environment’s always competitive. Have you seen anything the last three months or so that you find markedly different than the previous year or whatever? I mean, is there any significant changes out there?
David B. Dillon:  Haven’t seen the competitive environment change. What we’ve said is that we have seen the consumer confidence environment during the holidays come to a little lower level in terms of their spending level. But that’s about the only change that I’ve noted recently.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  A lot of my questions have been answered, but I’d like to talk a little bit more about fuel. I think you said that in the fourth quarter the bottom line impact was nil or very low. If we start to think about what happened in the prior three quarters and then also what we should anticipate, I mean we’ve been spending a lot of time trying to take – show the impact of lower fuel prices and finding it rather challenging. So maybe some guidance on that?
David B. Dillon:  Well, the first thing you should remember on fuel is to remember that it is hard to predict any single quarter. And last year actually would illustrate it maybe even hard to predict the whole year. But certainly quarter-to-quarter is hard for us to know until we get into the quarter. We did not expect in advance the way it fell in the quarters this past year, where we had very strong margins in the third quarter in particular. We also had strong margins in second quarter but they were much stronger in the third. The year before that we had strong margins in the second and in the fourth. And so what we’re forecasting for the year is something closer to where we were in 2007 in margins per gallon and we are forecasting growth in gallons. So that’s how I would look at this and the quarters will end up how the quarters end up on gas in terms of the actual margins, but it will have a – it has the effect of moderating itself when you go over four quarters in time.
W. Rodney McMullen:  And that’s also the reason why we try to give a lot of our financial results if you exclude the effect from fuel because we understand the retail fuel price has huge effects on our income statement especially. And that’s one of the reasons why we try to give that insight. Now the way we manage it internally we’re focused incredible on gallons growth and that’s how we manage the business and that’s how we’re incentified to manage that business while we’re –
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  Maybe I just will ask the question another way. Assuming the $0.11 of gas margin and current prices stay just about $2, will you be making about the same money from fuel bottom operating profit dollars as you made last year?
David B. Dillon:  It would be less than 2008 by a meaningful amount of money. And it would be more consistent with 2006 or 2007 and growing that for our growth and number of locations.
W. Rodney McMullen:  Meredith, that’s why we talked about the fact that the lower LIFO charge while it seems like a tailwind to ’09 that will be offset by the headwind meaningfully less EBITDA on fuel.
David B. Dillon:  The other thing if it’s helpful, at $0.11 our return on assets on that business continues to be very good. And it creates a very good shareholder return. 2008 was an unusually good year and would be very surprised to have very many of those.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  And then another question just did talk a little bit about some categories that were deflationary, I think dairy is deflationary and I think we said something about produce being deflationary. Is it fair to say that as retail prices are sticky on the way up, and I think you experienced that in the spring of ’07, that retail prices would be sticky on the way down?
David B. Dillon:  I think it’ll depend on the items and the markets, but yes I think that’s reasonably fair to assume that in some cases that will be true. Produce for us was actually had some inflation, but it was a much lower rate of inflation than we had experienced. And dairy was deflationary I think wasn’t it? Yes. But yes I think that’s fair to say that there is perhaps some lag as the costs go down before the retails actually get fully reflected.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  My final structure is more a capital structure question. It looks like your bonds are trading very well now. What would you expect to see before you would decide to buy back stock? Because your stock price is quite low in my opinion and it’s a great opportunity.
David B. Dillon:  Well, we thank you for that commercial. Mike, you want to comment on that?
J. Michael Schlotman :  Well, I mean the biggest issue out there in today’s market, Meredith, isn’t necessarily where our bonds are trading on an absolute basis, because I actually agree with Dave, thanks for the commercial. Because I agree with both of your points.  The bigger issue today is what does our coverage ratio need to be to maintain a triple B flat rating and to get the one positive watch we have from triple B minus up to triple B flat? We’re keenly focused on having all three at a triple B flat. That will open up the A2/P2 market because today we can only issue commercial paper in the A3/P3 market. And there’s a lot of liquidity there but it’s at least double if you can get the A2/P2. So that’s a focus to get our ratio a little better which would have us a little less eager to buying stock. And then the other issue is our bank credit facility which is $2.5 billion and expires in November of 2011. We are planning and conducting ourselves with the expectation that we won’t have nearly the same kind of facility when we renegotiate that between now and then in either size, term or price. And we’re trying to make sure that we develop internally some of that liquidity rather than the reliance that we’ve been able to have on the bank credit markets that’s there today. So all of that said, the overhang is really the bank credit market and our belief that we need to be a little bit less reliant on a $2.5 billion type facility than is available today.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital:  And I guess my final question would be about capital investments. You are still planning to spend a fair amount. Are you still seeing the kind of returns in the projects that you’ve had over the past times? Are you adjusting where you spend money based on expectations of returns?
David B. Dillon:  We continue to adjust our investment of where we invest it and how we invest it. Our remodels and expansions continue to develop very well compared to our 11.3% internal hurdle rate and the budgets that the divisions forecasted when they developed those. The returns on our net new stores and relocations while good as compared to 11.3% return are not quite as good in the early years yet on those first year or so of the budget, which is one of the reasons you continue to see our new and [re-lows] come down and the number of our expansions and remodels go up.  I would expect that trend to continue. The range we did give today is $1.9 to $2.1 billion and I do want to note that each end of that range is $100 million less than last year’s guidance of $2 to $2.2 billion.
W. Rodney McMullen:  Thanks Meredith. We have time for one more question.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan.
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan:  Could you just clarify your traffic comment? You said that it increased. Does that mean it’s positive or did it just increase relative to the prior quarter?
David B. Dillon:  It’s positive. The increase I was talking about was compared to the year before.
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then on the –
W. Rodney McMullen:  And it was positive.
David B. Dillon:  Yes, and it was positive. Yes.
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan:  And on the 1 to 2% product cost inflation, how do you see that trending by quarter? Is it sort of in the 3 to 4% range now and getting flat by the end of the year? And when you look to 2010 can you guys envision a deflationary environment?
David B. Dillon:  Well, someone on an earlier question asked or commented about that, about they assumed that it was more rear weighted and I think that’s a fair assumption. Remember LIFO which does not determine how we calculate our inflation, but LIFO is a calculation that really is a snapshot essentially at the end of the year, almost at the end of the year as to where we were compared to the year before. And Mike you may want to comment on the rest, but I don’t think we expect to have a deflationary environment.
J. Michael Schlotman:  Going out to 2010 would be difficult at best, and I won’t go there. I do agree with Dave’s comment that we would expect it to moderate as the year goes on and keep in mind that prices have to actually come down for there to be disinflation. Just no price increases means it’s flat. It doesn’t mean it’s negative.
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan:  And then last question, housekeeping, looks like you did a reclass between your cogs and SG&A line. Could you just discuss what you guys did there?
David B. Dillon:  I don’t know what you’re referring to.
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan:  Okay.
David B. Dillon:  Give Carin a call afterwards and – 
Charles Grom - J.P. Morgan:  Okay. Thanks very much.
David B. Dillon:  Thank you and before we sign off though I’d like to share some thoughts with our associates who have joined us today. First a really big thank you for your outstanding efforts throughout 2008. In a year when challenges only escalated, you made a positive difference for our customers by providing meaningful value in so many ways. I want to congratulate each of you on a job well done last year. Your commitment to one initiative in particular paid off in an extremely powerful way last year. Kroger’s perishable donation partnership, which allows stores to donate perishable food that’s still safe and nutritious to eat that can no longer be sold in the stores, expanded to include more than a half of our stores last year.  And thanks to your efforts, our family of stores contributed nearly 14 million pounds of fresh meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables to local food banks in the communities we serve. This fresh meat and produce provides much needed protein and nutritional value to food banks that struggle to supplement the dry goods and canned foods that they typically receive. Our perishable donation program helped us feed hungry families and is gratifying for you, our associates, who hate throwing away edible food. It’s also good for Kroger and the environment because it helps us reduce waste. We continue to add new stores to the program and we hope to have 85% of our stores donating perishable food by the end of 2009. Our goal is to deliver 25 to 30 million pounds of perishable food annually.  Well, thank you for all you do. That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the third quarter 2008 Kroger Co. earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. 
Carin Fike: Before we begin I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.Kroger.com. Now I will turn it over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon: With me today to review Kroger's third quarter 2008 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman, Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Rodney will discuss details of our quarterly performance. First, I'll discuss what drove our sales during the quarter, and our outlook in this economy. Then we'll be happy to take your questions.  Kroger's third quarter sales continued to be strong in a tough economy. Identical supermarket sales rose 5.6%, without fuel, reflecting the strength of our customer-focused strategy that we developed six years and continue to sharpen today. Identical sales growth was positive across all departments and all supermarket divisions. We are still seeing slowness in sales of discretionary general merchandise and jewelry, a trend we have discussed with you since the fourth quarter of 2007. This slowness continues to get worse. Overall we are pleased with our strong sales trend, particularly in this environment. We realized higher product cost inflation continues to play a role, but our business model is designed to deliver consistent results, whether the market conditions are favorable or less than ideal. Sales in regions affected by Hurricane Ike thanks to the outstanding efforts of our associates. Our teams worked tirelessly to get stores back in business quickly to serve families as they recovered and restocked their households. And we appreciate the dedication of associates throughout our organization who supported customers and colleagues in the aftermath of the hurricane. Kroger's focus on low prices, quality products, and providing a convenient one-stop solution for their daily needs continues to resonate with customers and drive sales. Several trends we have discussed in the past few quarters continue throughout the third quarter, namely a growing interest in private-label products and prepared foods as consumers choose to prepare and eat more meals at home and a sharper focus on price from all customers and all segments. Customer interest in our corporate brands continues to accelerate in the third quarter for two reasons. First, the current environment is prompting customers to try more of our private-label products, and second, the overall strength and breadth of Kroger's private-label program appeals to shoppers on any budget. For the second quarter in a row we saw accelerated growth in our corporate-brand penetration, both in terms of grocery sales dollars and units. During the quarter corporate brands represented almost 27% of Kroger's grocery sales and 34% of grocery units. And our proprietary loyalty card data indicates approximately 14% of our customers are trading over in the purest sense by simply buying the same for less by switching to one of our corporate brands in any of the three tiers we offer. Our robust corporate brands program is a fundamental part of our Customer 1st Strategy. Our quality products are strengthening our connection with our customers as we work to earn their life-long loyalty. Kroger's corporate brand products are produced and sold in three tiers, private selection, store banner brand like Kroger's or Fry’s or King Sooper or Ralph’s, and our value brand. We continue to expand our private label offering across all three tiers. While our entire private label portfolio is winning over customers, we are seeing particularly strong growth in both our private selections and value tiers. In fact, as we outlined earlier this year, our premium tier, private selections, which includes organic lines and gourmet meats, cheeses and deserts, to name just a few, is enjoying significant growth and is on track to reach $1.0 billion in sales in 2008. We expect to continue to see solid growth in this important area, even after the economy recovers and we will continue to invest in Kroger's private label program. One other advantage of our strong corporate brands program that it offers is as leverage when we have a supplier who approaches us with product a cost increase. This advantage has become even more important in an inflationary economy and Rodney will discuss this in more detail in a few moments. I mentioned earlier that we continued to see growth in prepared foods as consumers choose to dine out less often and eat at home instead. This is a continuation of a trend that we have seen for some time. We did see strong sales in our deli/bakery and prepared foods departments again in the third quarter and are pleased that customers are increasingly looking to us to fulfill their needs for convenient, ready-to-eat meals. Our sushi bars, hot soup, sandwich counters, and refrigerated soups and entrees are all doing well as a result of this shift in consumer behavior. In fact, the third quarter marked the 11th consecutive quarter of identical supermarket sales above 6% in our deli departments. This is nearly three years of consistently strong growth. We will continue to invest in developing prepared food options that are meaningful to our customers. As we have discussed with you a number of times, Kroger's has been investing in lower prices for our customers for the past six years. Our pricing strategy plays particularly well in this environment as shoppers are increasingly focused on prices of staples they buy week after week and we are seeing signs that prices of staple items are increasingly becoming a deciding factor for customers in determining where they should spend their grocery dollars. We are pleased that millions of households are choosing Kroger's family of stores because of the value, convenience, and quality that we provide and we remain focused on investing in lower prices for our customers, especially when they need it most. The strength of our loyalty card program helps us deepen the connection we have with our customers. The scope and depth of our shopper card program is unmatched in the industry. These cards link our customers to savings on groceries, fuel, pharmacy needs, general merchandise, and corporate brands. We use data derived from our loyalty card program to tailor unique coupon offerings for specific households. A recent mailing went out to more than 9.0 million households. Of those, 95% of those offers were unique to each household because we understand and appreciate that no two customers are alike. Some may live in the same city, some in the same neighborhood, and even on the street, but we know that they don’t have the same shopping habits. This level of personalization is a direct link to our customers no other U.S. grocery retailer can replicate. These are just some of the competitive advantages fueling our sales performance. In today’s environment Kroger's team stands out. We continue to post positive identical sales growth consistently because of the unwavering commitment of our associates to our Customer 1st Strategy. And as Rodney will describe, we have the financial wherewithal to leverage our powerful strategy even in a difficult environment. We are on track to deliver another year of solid results. We have confirmed our identical supermarket sales guidance for the year and raised our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008. We are also looking forward to another year of earnings per share growth in 2009 driven by continued strong trends in identical sales, even with the current forecast of the less inflationary environment. Now I would like to turn the call over to Rodney for some additional detail on our third quarter results and 2008 guidance.
W. Rodney McMullen: We are pleased with Kroger's third quarter results, particularly against the backdrop of this tough economic environment and believe they illustrate the strength and flexibility of Kroger's business model in varying economic conditions. Today I will offer some perspectives on certain elements of our results, including the effect of Hurricane Ike, LIFO expense, and strong fuel margins. I will also discuss Kroger's financial strategy, pension issues of today’s environment, and share additional color on guidance. I will begin with Hurricane Ike and its effect on our third quarter earnings. Our results included a pre-tax charge of $25.0 million, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share, related to property damage and the disruption of our business caused by Hurricane Ike this past September. The $25.0 million figure represents Kroger's retention under its property insurance and business interruption coverage. Our total losses exceeded that amount. The effect of the hurricane on our business was far-reaching. Ike and its remnants disrupted our operations in Texas and several inland states, including parts of Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio, causing property damage, extended power outages, and fuel supply issues in several additional markets. While we did incur some expenses we also realized some benefits as customers restocked their households after the hurricane. We believe these two outcomes likely offset each other. Further, we are preparing a claim under our insurance coverage and in compliance with GAAP accounting rules, will record a receivable once an agreement on the reimbursement amount is determined. As Dave said, our associates did a terrific job to serve customers in the areas affected by Ike. To give you just one example of how quickly our teams moved, our Kroger's store in Galveston, which sits on the Galveston Bay, was the first major supermarket to reopen after Ike. The island was devastated, but our associates partnered with co-workers in other areas to get the right resources to Galveston quickly to get our store there in shape to serve that community when it needed it most. We want to thank our associates again for a superb job. Without efforts like this, the effect of Ike would have been much worse. Another unanticipated item during the quarter was the magnitude of our LIFO charge. We certainly expected a LIFO charge but the detailed analysis we conduct at the end of each quarter to update our estimate produced a result significantly different than our previous expectations.  Recall that when we reported our second quarter results in September we were estimating a full-year expense of approximately $160.0 million for 2008. We now anticipate the figure will be closer to $200.0 million. The incremental $40.0 million applies to the entire year and disproportionately burdens our third quarter results. It is important to remember that the LIFO charge is an estimate for the first three quarters because we calculate our actual LIFO expense in the fourth quarter. Of all the estimates required for our quarterly financial statements, LIFO expense may involve the most mirrorability, particularly during periods of product cost changes, as we have seen over the past year or so. The LIFO calculation is complex and depends on a variety of factors but the two primary drivers are year-end inventory level and product cost inflation at a particular point in time during the year. For Kroger's that snapshot is the 48th year of a 52 week fiscal year. For the past two years, determination of the LIFO charge has added significant volatility to our quarterly results. We don’t enjoy the volatility any more than you do. When product cost inflation was non-existent to moderate, the impact on our financial results was not a significant. Now with grocery inflation at levels we have not seen in almost 20 years, the effect of the volatility is magnified. During the third quarter our estimated product inflation was roughly 6% with levels of over 7% in many center of the store grocery categories. To give you just one example, canned vegetables is one category where we saw high product cost inflation in the second quarter and even a higher percentage increase in the third quarter. The dollar amount on that inventory is also high. Even with the added earnings volatility our objective in using the LIFO method of accounting for our product inventories remains the same and that is to reduce Kroger's cash tax obligation. So while the non-cash LIFO charge hurts earnings and can increase the variability of our projections, it ultimately helps cash flow and we believe that is a wise trade-off. In order to maximize this benefit, Kroger's carries over 95% of its inventory balance on LIFO. This is higher than nearly all our supermarket peers. Kroger's has been using the LIFO method for a longer period of time than many of our industry peers and this also affects the magnitude of our expense. As you consider the effect of LIFO accounting on other food retailers, keep in mind that some of our discount competitors carry a significant amount of general merchandise inventory in addition to grocery inventory. For those retailers, deflation in certain general merchandise categories can mask inflation they may experience in their grocery inventories. We understand that raising our full-year LIFO estimate for 2008 may seem counter-intuitive to many of you at the this, but certain commodity prices have declined from historical highs and while in general prices of some commodities have leveled or dropped, we continue to receive cost increases from several of our product suppliers during the quarter. Those higher costs are the primary driver of the higher LIFO estimate. As you would imagine, we are discussing pricing issues with many of our vendors to make sure that the price that they charge Kroger's reflects the appropriate input costs. As we have described for you several times, Kroger's manufacturing business and strong corporate brands portfolio gives us additional leverage in these discussions. As product costs do come down, keep in mind that we plan to pass along that benefit to our customers. We do not view lower product costs as a margin expansion opportunity. This mind set and approach is in line with our overall customer focus strategy. Now I would like to comment briefly on our retail fuel operations. We did see exceptionally strong margins in our fuel business reflecting our typical margin experience when wholesale fuel costs declined, as they did throughout the quarter. Considering the following year-on-year comparison, the cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers was $0.239 compared to $0.087 in the prior year.  While the effect on Kroger's earnings were quite favorable, we have been in the fuel business long enough to know that the fuel margins do tend to normalize over a longer period of time. On a rolling four-quarter basis, the cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.156 this year compared to $0.109 last year. But even that rolling four-quarter figure is skewed by two quarters of very strong fuel margins this year. We expect a more normalized fuel margin would be approximately $0.11 plus or minus a little. Next, I would like to update you on our financial strategy. Our company’s financial strength has long been a competitive advantage and is even more so in the current environment. Kroger's balance sheet is strong and our financial position gives us the flexibility to continue investments in our successful Customer 1st Strategy and store base that will create value for our shareholders in the future while delivering near-term financial results. We have aligned Kroger's cash flow priorities to leverage our financial strength and support an appropriate level of liquidity necessary under current economic conditions. We are now allocating cash flows primarily to capital investments, debt reduction, and dividend payments.  Given our current bias toward debt management, we were less aggressive in buying back shares during the quarter. Under current market conditions, this continues to be our position regarding share buybacks. As market conditions change, we will adjust our buyback activity accordingly. We are on track to invest $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion in capital projects for fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2009 we expect capital investments similar to 2008. Our emphasis on store remodel activity and infrastructure investments will continue.  Our debt leverage matrix are improving. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.96 compared with 2.02 during the same period last year. At the end of the quarter total debt was $8.0 billion, an increase of $553.0 million from a year ago. As a reminder, the third quarter is typically our seasonal peak for debt levels as we build inventories to prepare for the holiday season to make sure we have inventory for Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the credit markets remain under stress, Kroger's has ample sources of funding available to meet both short- and long-term financing needs. The company’s $2.5 billion committed 5-year credit facility maturing November 2011 continues to be available. Even on peak borrowing days, we expect to have more than $1.2 billion of this facility remaining available. We also maintain uncommitted money market lines totaling $75.0 million. Furthermore, our access to the commercial paper markets has improved and we continue to obtain short-term funding as needed. Our long-term funding sources are also well managed. In 2009, our only significant debt maturity is $350.0 million in senior notes due on June 1. Under normal conditions we would typically refinance that debt within a few days of maturity.  Current market conditions are anything but normal so when we saw an opportunity this past November to issue debt we did so. We were pleased to place $600.0 million in long-term bonds with a coupon rate of 7.5%, particularly in this environment. There was significant demand for this offering. This illustrates bond investors’ assessment of the strength of Kroger's balance sheet and business. I wanted to spend just a few minutes talking about pensions. Many investors are wondering how the current market conditions are affecting both the company-sponsored and multi-employer pension plans. For the company sponsored defined benefit plans we expect 2009 expense to be comparable to 2008. We expect to contribute between $150.0 million and $200.0 million to those plans in 2009. This is more than the 2007 and 2008 but comparable to 2006. For the company’s 401(k) plan we expect a slight increase in our cash contributions and expense. This is a result of higher enrollment by our associates as they respond to our efforts to encourage employees to save for their retirement. For multi-employer plans, we do not expect a significant increase in contributions, and therefore expense, in 2009. Should current market conditions persist into 2010 we would expect contributions for the company sponsored defined benefit plans and multi-employer plans to increase during 2010. Regarding labor relations, we are currently negotiating agreements that cover our store associates in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Portland. Looking to next year, we will enter negotiations covering store associates in Albuquerque, Atlanta, Dallas, Dayton, Denver, and Roanoke.  Our objective in every negotiation is to achieve competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care. The likely increase in pension costs and how they align with other labor priorities will need to be addressed in bargaining. Our ability to balance competitive costs with associate benefits allows Kroger's to invest in our business and create new job opportunities for existing and future associates. Now turning to guidance, as Dave said, we are confirming our identical sales and raising our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2008. We expect identical supermarket sales growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, excluding fuel, for the full year. Excluding the $0.03 for diluted share charge related to Hurricane Ike, full-year earnings are expected in the range of $1.88 to $1.91 per diluted share. This equates to an annual growth rate of 11% to 13% over fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.69 per diluted share and implies a fourth quarter earnings range of $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share. Kroger's dividend yield of more than 1% further enhances shareholder return. This guidance range considers the cautious mind set of many consumers this holiday season.  Looking to 2009, we are currently projecting identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3% to 5%. We do think inflation will be lower next year than in 2008. Our current expectation for product cost inflation would be in the range of 2% to 3%. This identical sales growth will enable Kroger's to generate earnings per share growth that combined with our dividend, will create a solid return for shareholders. Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
David B. Dillon: Before we take your questions I would like to offer some additional thoughts on Kroger's third quarter performance. On the whole we are pleased with our strong sales in the quarter, particularly considering the difficult economic environment. Our identical supermarket sales are among the best in the industry and we achieved those even with the considerable challenges Hurricane Ike presented. Our sales show our Customer 1st Strategy is working. We are increasing customer traffic in our stores and selling more to customers who already shop with us. Our industry-leading corporate brands are gaining momentum and our pricing strategy is resonating with shoppers. We are making our customers lives easier by offering them a one-stop solution for their daily household needs. During the quarter, we are in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by strong margins in our fuel business. But as Rodney mentioned, fuel margins do vacillate from quarter to quarter and tend to normalize over a longer time frame. We do not run our business based on margins.  Still, we could have done a better job in managing expenses during the quarter. Our OG&A performance was disappointing and we will improve. We must be relentless in our efforts to reduce expenses so that we can continue to drive cost savings back into lower prices and a better overall shopping experience for our customers. We are keenly aware that the economy will continue to put pressure on our customers and our organization. Our Customer 1st Strategy is designed to give us the flexibility to perform well in good times and in bad. We are focused on maintaining our strong financial position so that we can continue to invest in our successful Customer 1st Strategy and produce a solid return for our shareholders. Now, we would like to take a few minutes to answer your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: I would just like clarification on your sales guidance for the full year. On the identical sales range of 4.5% to 5.5%, that implies a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter, so I am wondering if you could comment where sales are trending right now and what would make you think they decelerate enough to get you to the low end of the range for the full year. And to follow up on that note, talk a little bit about the potential for a deflationary environment and what you think that would mean for retail prices.
David B. Dillon: It is a wide range, of course. But now times are such that it is a little less predictable than you might want, but to just give you a feel, we have four weeks under our belts in the quarter. The calendar is a little bit different this year in that Thanksgiving was at the very end of the month, and we had a two-day shift in the first of the month, back from February all the way until now and each month has produced some unusual results. But even with all of that in the first four weeks of the quarter we are just a tick below 5% IDs without fuel; it’s where we are right now. So that gives you a sense of the picture today. We described that some of the discretionary products have been an issue all year long. In fact, we started describing it, I think, fourth quarter last year and it has gotten a little worse.  Fourth quarter is an important time for that. That would be one of the reasons for leaving a little breathing room on those numbers. But generally, you can see we are bullish in what we have achieved and our connection with the customer has been strong so I am actually feeling pretty good about things, given the environment that we are operating in. One other piece that might be helpful to you that, generally speaking, it would be a little different in the holiday moments, but generally speaking the discretionary items we are talking about are roughly 10% of our sales. It wouldn’t be just some general merchandise items but it would be general merchandise and some other items in the store, but roughly in that range. So it’s not 50% of our business, and it’s also not 1% or 2%. It would be a bigger part of the business for Fred Meyer. That would give you a feel for that, too. And then thinking about the inflationary environment going forward, we do recognize with commodity prices there is some likelihood that the retail prices will begin to plateau, maybe even decline. And in fact, in some categories and some items we have even seen that happen already. And certainly our efforts, as you know, because of the pricing position we take we are going to push the price out of things if we can, to make sure that we come out on the side of our customer in times like this. And as we look at inflation as it does subside, it of course takes a little bit out of our sales lift that may be due to inflation, but that’s not the only thing happening in our sales lift. A lot of it is the more relevant connection we have with our customer.
Don W. McGeorge: To me, in a deflationary environment, I feel very comfortable we will perform very well relative to our competitors and better than many. And we think manufacturing always gives us a competitive advantage because we will be able to take those lower costs and give them to the customer sooner than some of our competitors will be able to, which should allow us to further gain some share. So that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be easy but I don’t think any environment is easy in retail and I feel very good about our ability to react and adopt to whatever the environment is and utilize some of the strengths that we have.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: And on gas prices coming down, one, is are you seeing any change in consumer behavior? Higher traffic, with the lower gas prices, or shift in traffic versus basket. And then could you give us what the fourth quarter gas margin was year?
David B. Dillon: On customer traffic, we saw customer traffic as we have seen, really, all year long. Customer traffic, as measured by transactions, has increased, both on a total and an identical basis. Our transaction size has increased, but you should recognize that there is quite a little bit of inflation in that number and so I would have to say once you take the inflation out we have had actually stronger increase in the number of transactions than we have actually even in the average sale. But the average sale is strong, too, but in part because of the inflation.
J. Michael Schlotman: Gas margins, the fourth quarter last year would be a little over $0.12, about $0.125 and that was a little bit higher than the rolling four-quarter number.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neil Currie – UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS: The sales performance you are achieving right now is outstanding and I hear your sort of cautious tones for next year and I note that at the beginning of this year you also forecasted 3% to 5%. To what extent is the current economic environment actually a benefit to you right now? You have clearly driven a good price image amongst your consumers who see you as potentially a place to save money. Is the current environment actually driving more people to your stores, helping you to gain market share? 
David B. Dillon: That is a great question and is you look the way we have described that throughout the whole year, there are certainly parts of the current economy that have helped us. In particular the parts related to customers when they decide it is less expensive to either get prepared meals at Kroger's or to buy ingredients and make meals at home. We are a great way to save.  And the investments that we have made in our retail pricing for the last six years continue to resonate well with customers, they recognize it, they see that, and they have responded. So in an economic environment like this, that certainly helps. It also helps that when the gas prices were high, now at the moment they are lower, but when they were high, certainly customers saw us as a ready access for gasoline, one-stop shopping. They like that combination and it seemed to work well. The convenience of our store to a neighborhood also worked well in the high fuel price moments, but we still see traffic strong even despite the fact that gasoline has dropped a bit. What we described earlier in the year, though, was that if conditions did not worsen. And clearly, as an economy, things have gotten a little worse across the country and I think you can see that in some elements of our business, too, in the things that we have released today. And on the whole, as a result, there are some things that are negatively tugging at our business in the economy but there are plenty of things that are working for the positive. The bottom line for us is that when an economy is bad, people are still going to eat and somebody, some retailer, is going to do well and we are really committed to it being us.
Don W. McGeorge: The other thing, as we look at 2009 expectations and what we have outlined, is really trying to make sure we position the company for sustainable growth, and not just for 2010 but 2010 and beyond. And we want to make sure that we position it appropriately so that we have a long runway in front of us and not just a one-year runway, too.
Neil Currie - UBS: Just to touch on some of those comments, also in regards to people eating out less, could you give us some color on how your convenience are doing, or prepared foods? I know you have had some new ranges introduced via Green Core, but maybe on some of the other prepared-type meals and deli items that you have, are you seeing strong sales there?
David B. Dillon: We are. We have a wide variety of products that would fit that category and I wouldn’t single any of them out, but one of the comments I had in our prepared comments was that for 11 quarters now, almost three years, our delis have run in excess of 6% identical sales and that is a long time.  That is important to note because that means that we have responding to that trend for a long time and that we keep getting better and our customers keep recognizing that and it has now been year after year, after year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.
Analyst for Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.: I just wanted to ask about share gains. Implied with your comp results, your ID results, you are picking up share. Where do you think you are getting it from? Is it from super centers, from conventional competition, from all the above?
David B. Dillon: First of all, we don’t give any public share changes until once a year and we will do that in March, when we come back and look at that data. But clearly, the business that we are getting though, is from lots of different places. As we have pointed out, in most of our markets, that even if you take us and others of large scale in our business, there is still roughly half the market that is up for grabs. And in addition to that, the most important I think, is to recognize how much restaurants are a piece of the eating action anymore. In the last 20 years that is probably the single biggest trend that occurred in the U.S. communities as the people started eating at restaurants a lot more frequently. Well, that doesn’t have to change very much for it to be a very healthy thing for supermarkets, and I think we continue clearly to see that working to our advantage.  And that is partly driven by the economy, it is partly driven by the kind of products that we are offering now and the experience customers have is partly driven by the price structure and pricing practices we have and it is partly driven by people’s desire to have more meals at home with families. So all of those work, really, to our advantage.
Analyst for Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.: And I wanted to ask about in an environment where gas prices are actually coming down, or have come down, how do you view the $0.05 discounts or have you strategized what you are going to do with gas in a $2.00 per gallon environment or below?
David B. Dillon: Our gas strategy is a lot more than just discounts like that. The real value is the convenience of having gas at a location where you can do most of your shopping, most of the household needs that we have, and at a retail price, our street price, is very competitive.  In fact, I have had customers actually thank me for when we opened gas stations in their neighborhood because we tended to bring the prices down in that area, that were posted at the pump, not only us but other would then match our price. So on the whole I think customers see us as both convenient and a good price place to get gas. And then the gas promotions that you are describing are helpful, too, in that they do reward people who shop with us more regularly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Could you briefly talk about the convenience stores? How they did in the quarter.
W. Rodney McMullen: The c-stores had a great quarter. They had both strong identical inside sales and strong gallon growth and we are very pleased. And obviously the strong gas margins were on top of that. So one of the things we always do internally is look at our relative performance to the other public companies and we felt we had an unusually good quarter relative to the other public companies, this quarter.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Does the gas margin information you provided earlier include the convenience store element?
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes, it is c-stores and supermarkets added together.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Looking at gasoline and the customers’ response to the promotion aspect of it, how has that changed with gasoline coming down?
David B. Dillon: I don’t think it has changed very much. It is an ongoing program that we have had for a long time.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: So people still want it.
David B. Dillon: Yes, they still want it. I think the biggest difference is that when gas got up over $4.00 a gallon people were pinched but as they filled up their tank they had less cash and I think it was noticeable to people’s budgets. Now that the gas is back down, at the moment, under $2.00, I don’t know how long that will last but at the moment that is where it is, customers have a little bit more spending cash.  But how they will spend that is anybody’s guess. Whether they will go back to restaurants a little bit more, that’s one of the values of us having given you an indication of where we are three to four weeks in the quarter, just to give you a sense that things really haven’t changed much. And that was our objective so that you could see that, even since gas has been low in this current quarter.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: You bought 3.0 million shares of stock in the quarter. Was that early in the quarter and what is your philosophy on stock buybacks here? Do you stop it all together or are you going to be in and out of the market, but just be overall less aggressive?
Don W. McGeorge: In this market we will be cautionary on the amount of stock we buy back. We still have a buyback plan in place that puts us in the market at certain prices, but just given the backdrop of the liquidity of the debt markets today, we feel it is prudent to maintain as much flexibility from the liquidity standpoint as possible and not be out buying shares when there is uncertain access to debt markets. Now that said, we have had no problem accessing the debt markets and the commercial paper markets have opened back up for us to some extent. It is not always the best rate but we do issue some commercial paper from time to time, to keep our name out there. Overall it has gotten a little better but until we see marked improvement we are likely to remain cautionary and devote our cash to debt pay-downs, dividends, and keeping a strong capital program.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Any thoughts on improving the dividend yield at current stock price?
David B. Dillon: Obviously that is a choice that the Board makes and we have that choice and the market has another choice. If the stock price drops that of course increases our yield but that is not our objective.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: That’s not the way I was asking it.
Don W. McGeorge: Obviously, we haven’t had a dividend for that long and there are two things when you reinstitute a dividend you want to make sure of. One, that you can continue to maintain the dividend and we do think it is appropriate, over time, to continue to increase the dividend in terms of the dividend per share. And that would be our long-term goal, without getting specific about what we would do in any one fiscal year.
David B. Dillon: And I think in an environment like this you would have to consider all of the current factors, too, as we would always do. And I won’t speculate now on what the Board would want to do on that.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.: Can you give us any insight into how gift card sales are tracking?
J. Michael Schlotman: So far so good, but it’s still very early, and as Dave mentioned before, the calendar has shifted so much that you really don’t know for sure until where the holiday ends, but so far so good. But we won’t be able to really give you a definite answer until after the holidays.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: One of the biggest surprises to me this quarter, I think even more so than the LIFO charge, was the OG&A rate. You mentioned it a little bit, but it was up about 7.6%. That growth rate is higher than what we have seen historically. I think, ex the Ike impact, the ratio was up 23 basis points. Can you talk a little bit about what happened there this quarter?
David B. Dillon: In my mind, too, that is the soft spot in our quarter and I agree with the comments that you made. Let’s get the perspective just for a moment. The number we indicated was a 40 basis point increase but if you adjust that for the deductible in Ike, it was a 23 basis point increase, without the fuel. We described health care as being at 13 basis points of that and we described energy-related and oil-related kinds of products, like utilities and bag expense, supplies, that sort of things as being 5 basis points of that.  All that is helpful to explain where we are but our bottom line is that we could have done a better job of managing expenses, that our OG&A performance was, even to us, disappointing and that we will improve.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: If you look at some of your competitors, specifically Safeway, who now is really growing SG&A, or really not growing SG&A, it’s kind of flattish, and I get the company is focused more on SG&A, when the top line is maybe not going as well, and clearly that is not what is happening with you. But what is the opportunity for you, going forward, to control SG&A a lot more aggressively? Safeway will talk about how they can do it and not impact their IDs. Is that something that you think is an opportunity going forward?
David B. Dillon: Yes, we do agree that it is an opportunity going forward. And if you look at our history, 2006 and 2007 and 2008, I think in that whole time other than last quarter, only one quarter, did our OG&A actually go up. All the rest it was declining numbers. And that is our objective. That is our future objective. We believe the opportunity is there.  The caution for us internally is to say that we want to make sure that we don’t mess up our offering to the customer. That is real important. We could slash OG&A expense pretty easily just simply by cutting costs. That is not our objective.  We are trying to changes processes, we are trying to change some of our conventional mind sets on how to serve customers and we are trying to it in a way that the customer will actually see things as improved, not as worse. So with all that in mind, I guess that is a long-winded way of saying I agree with you. All of everything you said is right. We should have done better, we can do better, we expect to do better in the future. We are committing to ourselves and by saying what we have done, we are committing to you that we are going to work on that hard in the future quarters.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: Safeway is now slowing down its lifestyle remodel strategy. I assume that it has had at least some impact on you in the past. Do you see a benefit now going forward to your IDs, just from that program itself, rolling off?
David B. Dillon: I wouldn’t think that we would see anything specific as to that and plus I am not going to comment on any one competitor’s specific strategies and what they try to do or not do. I have said in the past that I admire what Safeway does and has done. I think they have done a good job with that program and I suspect they are slowing it because they have covered most of the stores they plan to cover. But that still means we are competing with a lot of the stores that have been converted, so it’s not those stores go away. They are a great competitor and we think we have fared as well in those markets as well as other markets.
Don W. McGeorge: This is a comment that is broader than just this quarter, but if you look, as Dave mentioned, for the quarter we had strong identical across the whole company and all divisions were positive. And you should assume that in order to get there that that means the identical were pretty consistent against competitors, too. So it’s very consistent across the whole company and across all types of competitors.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: I have a couple of questions, maybe following a little bit on some of the recent questions. First, in talking about expenses, you did particularly call out health care and I don’t remember you mentioning it so much recently. Could you talk a little about whether the increases were particularly at the corporate level or for your unionized plants and what are you going to do to manage that? Is it manageable?
David B. Dillon: It was disproportionately more in the company plan than in the plans covered by union agreements, that are jointly managed stress funds. It was a combination of things. It was in some parts a bad experience on some individual claims and some increase in claims generally.  The way we manage that, and expect to manage it going forward and have managed it in the past, is working hard at plan design, which we have made lots of design changes over time, and not simply trying to shift costs to employees. That’s not the objective of a plan design. The plan design changes our design, really, to cause an associated to have some skin in the game, where they actually have some of their money they’re spending and so they have to let the market make some choices for them about what they want to do in their own health care and do they want to be healthier in their own personal lifestyle and so forth, to reduce their costs. We have put a lot of emphasis, for instance, on health savings accounts and those programs do that very well. But we plan to continue some of the same strategies that we have had in the past and I do think it is manageable over time. Individual quarters, even individual years occasionally, may perk up a bit. You are right, we have not called it out in this particular way for some time, but we are paying close attention to it and it is an area that we think we can do a lot with.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: A question I have been getting a lot from investors about inflation, I remember 18 months ago, Dave, you said that food inflation was probably a neutral on the perishable side and a modest tailwind on the packaged good side. We still do have packaged good food inflation, but can you talk about, you were forward-looking at the time. Did you believe that on the packaged good side it was a modest positive to profit and what happens when you get deflation?
David B. Dillon: My personal opinion, based on the observations I have seen over the last several quarters, is that inflation is a moderate plus, just like we hypothesized at the time, but that when inflation either becomes erratic, that is occurs quickly, or is a much higher number, both of which occurred in the last quarter or so, then it starts to chip away at that net-net positive and makes it harder. And I think what has made this harder in the last quarter or two is lay that on top of an economy that went south in a very fast hurry, I think this year has been, for all of us, one for the record books. I don’t think anyone has expected many of the radical changes that occurred at the pace they occurred with the high variability. I think all that degree of uncertainty and so forth layered an additional element on top of just inflation at work. Had it been just inflation at work, it may have even continued to be still a net-net positive. Now I see it as a little bit more neutral than I did. I don’t see it as a harshly negative thing, though. Now you asked about deflation, deflation is another animal. I think it is going to depend on how it comes. We have seen commodity prices plateau, subside a little, and in some cases even decline from last year. How that gets translated into lower costs, and how quickly it does, and then how that gets played out in the markets and what happens in the consumer behavior in terms of the economy and their spending patterns, I think will all determine whether or not the less the moderate rate of inflation, the lower rate of inflation, will create a positive or just be neutral.
W. Rodney McMullen: I was just going to add one other comment. On the inflation, when you go back and look at as we put together our Customer 1st plan overall, and what we assumed would happen, and as you remember, one of the things we had always assumed was like Tesco would come to the US.  Well, one other major assumption we had made long term was that inflation would be somewhere between zero and 1% a year. So our fundamental belief, on a longer-term basis, is that inflation will be very modest. Obviously, the last year or so it has been higher than that but longer term we don’t think it will be and we have always tried to build our business model around that assumption that it wouldn’t be.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: So you are not looking at it and saying you benefited so much from inflation and now that we have deflation it’s going to hurt?
David B. Dillon: No, we’re not saying that. But we are cautious saying we are in unchartered territory, what’s occurred the last six months, and it makes it a little hard to forecast. And it makes the future a little hard to forecast because what we are going to experience is different than maybe has been experienced before.
W. Rodney McMullen: I feel very comfortable if you look at it over a year or a year and a half, the business will be able to adjust accordingly. But if inflation went from 6% positive to 6% negative in one quarter, I think it is going to take a little while to adjust for that. But longer term, and when I say longer term on that comment I mean a year to a year and a half, I think the business will readjust and things will be fine.
David B. Dillon: It further illustrates why we look at this business on an annual basis instead of just a quarter-to-quarter basis. And it also illustrates why we try not to manage it simply by margins. We are trying to look at our connection to the customer over time and the business we have with them over time.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: When you think about, I believe the branded manufacturers are still raising prices on packaged goods, partially because the locked in higher commodity costs, do you have a philosophy about the gap in pricing between your corporate brands and the national brands? Will you be widening that or is it category by category?
David B. Dillon: Well, it is item by item actually. It depends on what works well for the customers. When you look at what happened in the quarter, our tonnage on Kroger brand and corporate brand products increased. But as you can see from our sales and also the rate of inflation, our tonnage on the whole really grew a little but not a lot, as a company.  And that you can just do the math and know what happened with national brands. National brands plateaued, or even declined, in many cases. And that will, on their parts, require some rethinking of how they want to approach that business. But our view is that it is the customers we are interested in. We are not trying to beat the national brands with corporate brand necessarily. We think it is a great offering but many of our customers want the national brands and we see that as actually our friend. So our interest is in getting our customers what they need, which is lower prices, and if it is our Kroger's brand products and the national brands don’t follow suit, well that’s fine. We will just pick up even more market share than we are already picking up in the corporate brands and that will put further pressure on the national brands to get right on their pricing.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: You said that the higher LIFO had a particularly bad impact on the third quarter, but you are anticipating that it will be higher than your original plan in the fourth quarter, too, is that right? And did that contribute to the fact that the growth rate in the fourth quarter, which originally you thought would be faster than the rate for the whole year, will not be, based on your current guidance?
J. Michael Schlotman: If you look at it relative to expectations, LIFO in the fourth quarter will be higher than what we were thinking before. Not necessarily higher than last year, but certainly higher than prior expectation.
Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital: And that impacts the guidance?
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes. Three-thirteenths of the extra $40.0 million falls in the fourth quarter and ten-thirteenths is in the third quarter. That’s just how you have to book it. We have to get right year-to-date and it’s $40.0 million more expense for the year so year-to-date we have to get ten-thirteenths of the $40.0 million behind us and that leaves three-thirteenths, or about $9.0 million or $10.0 million for the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to dig in a little more on the gas margins. Our model was predicting a pretty big margin swing and the number you called out was fairly similar to it so that sounds like almost an $0.08 or $0.09 swing in earnings per share versus a year ago. Did you get to reinvest some of that into lower prices or did it come too late in the quarter?
David B. Dillon: As we mentioned in the comments I made is that the higher gas margins afforded the opportunity to some of the things we were otherwise doing, but we fully recognize that that’s not a permanent solution because gas margins were particularly high, we got partly by skill and partly by luck in the quarter but we’re not expecting that benefit out into the future and as a result we can’t permanently lock in spending that. It can only help us with some of our programs at that particular time.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: And did some of the gains carry into the first four weeks of the fourth?
J. Michael Schlotman: We won’t give that level of guidance because within the quarter it will swing all over the place and it’s way too early to tell you where we think it will be for the fourth quarter.
David B. Dillon: And on the quarter, the higher LIFO also costs almost $0.03.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: On pensions, on your company operated plan you said that the contribution may not increase. Are you just talking about the cash contribution? I would imagine the expense number would probably be higher because of this year’s shortfall, is that fair?
J. Michael Schlotman: No. On the company plans for 2009 we would expect cash contributions to increase, $150.0 million to $200.0 million. But we believe the expense related to that will be a very modest change.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Did you make some changes to the plan, to account for this year’s miss? After this year’s shortfall I would imagine that would increase expenses.
Don W. McGeorge: Keep in mind the way you account for a company sponsored plan is one year’s lost gets amortized over a several-year period of time, from a book standpoint. You don’t take all that one-year loss in one year.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: And then your discount rate goes higher probably.
Don W. McGeorge: The liabilities are discounted at the AA corporate rate and while the AA corporate rate, the base treasury is at historic lows, the spreads are at historic highs, so as I sit here today I would expect a higher discount rate this year than last year, which would mitigate some of the short fall from our return.
J. Michael Schlotman: And if you look, all recent hires, a few years ago we changed the plan to where it’s more a 401(k) because that’s really what our associates wanted in today’s world. And that change was made a couple of years ago, which also affects the numbers overall.
Operator: Your last question comes from Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: With regard to capex, the guidance was for flat in 2009 versus 2008. Can you provide a little bit more color around that and do you think there are opportunities for taking over locations from other retailers as well.
Don W. McGeorge: The guidance on capex would be organic capex. It would exclude any acquisition opportunity, so there wouldn’t be anything baked into that. If those kinds of opportunities come up, oftentimes it winds up accelerating the capital expenditure program. For instance, when we bought the stores in Ft. Wayne and Michigan in last year, being able to pick up those sites really fills out those markets quite well and you shift from needing to build new stores to remodels. So if those kinds of things are out there, there could be some trade-off. But we think that kind of a spending level is appropriate, given the remodel activity we have planned as well as some of the infrastructure spend that will use those dollars. Some of these are really good investments for the very long term that have very good returns and very solid returns, on the infrastructure side.
David B. Dillon: If you look at the dollars overall, as we have done for the last several years, we continue to focus more and more on remodels and expansions and it would have a very similar look in 2009 as what you have seen in 2008 and 2007 because we feel we are getting much better results out of the remodels and expansion projects.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Just going back to the sales guidance for 2009, IDs up 3% to 5% excluding fuel, when we compare this to the 4.5% to 5.5% for 2008, is the majority of the difference between the tiers, your outlook for product cost inflation, or just a conservative stance, or a combination of the two?
David B. Dillon: At the moment it would be more inflation-driven. You would probably accuse us of being more conservative.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: On the corporate brand penetration, health and beauty aids versus the rest of the store, what kind of opportunity is there in the HBA side?
David B. Dillon: I think there is big opportunity, actually, in HBC and still in grocery, too. But HBC would have a little bit more opportunity than grocery would. But we see them both as still really ripe for development and we continue to invest in the opportunity. Thank you all for joining us and before we end the call I would like to share with you some additional thoughts for our associates who are listening in today. For our associates, first, thank you for another quarter of strong sales. Our sales performance is a result of your individual contributions. The economy is pressuring more and more families every day and you have heard us mention low prices as one of the primary reasons customers are choosing our stores over others in this environment. Kroger's is able to continue to invest in lower prices for our customers because of cost saving that we work to find every day. And your personal commitment to saving costs no matter where you work in the organization, no matter how small the savings, makes our lower prices possible, helping to drive customers into our store. Every time a customer chooses us we are in a better position to take advantage of opportunities to grow our business. As your family members, friends, and neighbors celebrate this holiday season, please remind them about our low prices and our great products they can find at their neighborhood one-stop Kroger's store. As we close, I want to thank you for your commitment to our customers and to each other. I hope that you each take time to enjoy this holiday season with those close to you. Thank you for taking time to join us.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call.

Operator:  Welcome to the second quarter 2008 Kroger Co. earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. 
Carin Fike:  Before we begin I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.Kroger.com. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Dillon I want to take a moment to remind you about our upcoming investor conference here in Cincinnati on October 15th and 16th. We hope you will be able to join us. If you need information about the conference, please feel free to contact me after this call. Now I will turn it over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon :  With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2008 financial results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman, Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Rodney will discuss details of our quarterly and year-to-date performance. First, I'll begin discussing what we're seeing in terms of current economy and how we're managing our business successfully in this environment, then we'll be happy to take your questions.  Our performance in the last few years and the quarterly and year-to-date results we announced this morning highlight the underlying strength of Kroger's business model. Our customer-driven model, now in its fourth year of implementation, is comprehensive and leverages all facets of our business. While we manage this model on an annual basis, its inherent value is the flexibility it gives us to successfully navigate through various challenges we face from quarter to quarter. It allows us to remain focused on our plan and we are not forced to make short-term decisions that may negatively impact our long-term connection with customers. We believe this will create long-term sustainable earnings growth that will benefit our shareholders. And through our customer first strategy, we are squarely focused on our people, our products, our prices and the overall shopping experience for our customers. This strategy is designed to satisfy all customer segments, not just a subset of those we serve. We believe it is possible to do this. We know it's difficult to accomplish. We also believe we are the only retailer that has the infrastructure in place to accomplish this objective. In a moment I'll share some details on how our team is successfully applying Kroger's strategy to take advantage of opportunities in today's challenging environment. Before I do that, I will provide some context on current trends we're seeing.  During the quarter we did see more signs that the weak economy continues to drive consumer behavior. This was evident in some changes in our sales mix, such as corporate brands, for example. I will share some details about that in a few minutes. We also saw some stronger sales trends in our value-oriented stores. Both of these changes would suggest that some shoppers are looking for ways to stretch their budgets. At the same time, we believe we continue to benefit from customers choosing to eat at home more often. While some may be choosing to do so for economic reasons, others are adopting this practice in response to compelling evidence indicating that children who dine regularly with their families have a better chance of avoiding risky behavior such as substance abuse. We think strong sales in our deli/bakery and prepared foods correlate with this shift and with declining sales trends some casual dining chains are reporting.  We also saw product cost inflation accelerate in the second quarter. We estimate that our year-over-year product cost inflation was 4.9% excluding fuel. This rate was influenced by double-digit inflation in produce, an area where product cost can be volatile, but it's also influenced by high product costs in the grocery department, in the 5% to 6% range, which is the highest level of center store inflation that we've seen since the late 1980s. Inflation was also strong in the deli/bakery department. We continued to successfully pass along higher product costs in the form of higher retail shelf prices so, while customer behavior continues to change, we believe there's an opportunity for Kroger to gain share in this environment.  Through the first four weeks of the third quarter, Kroger's identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, are trending above 5%. We continue to take advantage of opportunities that promote the long-term growth of our business. We have many established competitive strengths to draw on to accomplish this successfully.  One of the most sophisticated tools we use to leverage opportunities in any economy is our vast collection of consumer data derived form our customer loyalty cards. We use this data to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer behavior. We've been building our extensive collection of consumer data since 1999. Today more than 40% of all U.S. households one of our shopper's cards. As a result, Kroger has one of the largest retail customer databases in America. Our partnership with dunnhumby USA gives us valuable insight into our customer's shopping habits. Through this insight we're able to use our customer loyalty data to benefit our customers and increase their engagement with our stores. Our work with dunnhumby also allows us to segment our store base to offer customers in each store the right mix of products and services. This store segmentation strategy and Kroger's multiple formats allows us to meet the specific needs of various customer segments. Our customer loyalty program also enables us to provide a valuable food safety service to our customers. We recently began incorporating receipt tapes and phone calls in our customer notification system for certain types of product recalls. Using our customer loyalty database, we're able to notify customers through their receipt tapes about the recalls of products that they may have purchased. We are one of the first retailers to use this personalized communication to our customers. Customers have told us how much they appreciate our effort to partner with them to keep their families safe. Another key opportunity for us in this economy is our innovative private label program. We continue to see shares of Kroger's corporate brands increase. In this economy, customers are much more willing to try a private label item, and we're seeing signs that this is happening more and more as the year progresses. Our strong corporate brand program also gives us some leverage when a supplier approaches us with a product cost increase. This leverage becomes even more important in an inflationary economy. Our three-tier program - Private Selections, Store Banner and Value brands - is the most extensive in the industry, with more than 14,400 items. We introduce new items on a regular basis to appeal to customers on any budget. Recent examples include Private Selections Organic meats, Active Lifestyle breads, and Three-Minute pizzas.  As I mentioned last quarter, Private Selections is our fastest growing brand. During the second quarter this line of premium products continued to do well with all customers, not just the customers who are upscale. Based on year-to-date trends, Private Selections will be a $1 billion brand for Kroger in 2008. Our Value brands, designed for more price-sensitive customers, are also building share. Our data shows that our private label grocery items in terms of dollars represents a record 26% of the company's grocery sales. Our share in terms of units is a record 33%. We believe investments we have made to strengthen our corporate brands program in the past several years will continue to drive future growth. As our progress in these areas show, we may be a traditional retailer, but we have a decidedly innovative and insightful approach to our business. Our strategy continues to serve our customers, shareholders and associates well, as our strong second quarter and year-to-date performance demonstrates. Kroger is delivering sustainable results today while we continue to invest for the future. We know market conditions will continue to be a challenge, and we believe our strategy works well in good times and bad. Kroger's team and our overall strategy clearly stand out in the current environment. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rodney for some additional detail on our second quarter results and 2008 guidance. 
W. Rodney McMullen:  Dave just described how Kroger is managing through the current challenging operating environment. We are pleased with Kroger's second quarter results, particularly in the context of this environment, and we believe they illustrate the strength and flexibility of Kroger's business model in varying economic conditions. We remain focused on delivering our annual financial commitments to investors and believe we are on track to do so. During the next several minutes I will offer a deeper dive into Kroger's financial results and share some color behind our updated full year outlook. Let's start with identical sales. We continue to see growth across most all departments. Our drug/general merchandise department identicals were flat compared to the prior year, and this is a little softer than the first and fourth quarters. Like some other retailers, we saw softness in certain discretionary items. This is consistent with what we've been seeing in those areas of our business for the past couple of quarters now. Yet still Kroger reported a 4.7% increase in identical supermarket sales excluding fuel for the quarter. This demonstrates the strength of our business and, as Dave mentioned, third quarter identicals, excluding fuel, through the first four weeks are about 5%.  Kroger's earnings for the quarter were $0.42 per diluted share, an increase of $0.04 over the prior year. About $0.01 of the increase came from strong margins at our retail fuel operations. I'll talk more about our fuel margins in a bit. First, I'd like to discuss some metrics that describe the performance of our core grocery operations. As many of you know, Kroger's business model is designed to provide investment in lower gross margins. As a result, Kroger's second quarter FIFO gross margin excluding fuel declined 51 basis points. Our supermarket selling gross margin excluding fuel declined 59 basis points. The 8 basis point difference between these two measures is primarily explained by 15 basis points of margin pressure from higher diesel fuel costs, partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in shrink. Recall that Kroger's non-fuel FIFO gross margin and supermarket selling gross margin expanded by 51 and 38 basis points, respectively, in the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting the timing of passing on product cost inflation in certain categories such as dairy to customers. If our second quarter 2007 FIFO gross margin had been more normalized, our rate decline in the second quarter this year would have been less. Another portion of the decline relates to product cost inflation and our practice of protecting penny's profit when we raise retail prices in response to product cost increases from suppliers. While this practice is designed to ensure that our gross margin dollars remain intact or even grow, it can have the effect of lowering our overall gross margin rate.  Turning to OG&A, our rate in the second quarter excluding fuel declined 28 basis points compared to the prior year. The prior year OG&A rate included pre-opening and transition costs associated with the Scott's and Farmer Jack acquisitions. The current year rate benefited from the absence of these costs. The current year rate also benefited from strong sales leverage and lower incentive compensation expense. Collectively, these benefits offset continued inflationary pressures that we face in several areas of our business, including credit card fees, utilities and store supplies.  Note that when I mention higher utility costs I am talking about the impact of higher utility rates. As we have told you before, our associates have done a remarkable job in controlling usage in this area. Since 2000 we have reduced our overall energy consumption per square foot by over 24% or 1.5 billion kilowatt hours.  While OG&A and FIFO gross margin were the main drivers of our second quarter operating margin, I also want to point out that rent and depreciation expense on a combined basis provided 6 basis points of operating margin leverage. One of the reasons we believe that a moderate level of inflation benefits our business model is because of the leverage we get from the increased sales dollars over the fixed costs in our business. This is a great example of that leverage. Kroger's non-fuel operating margin declined 20 basis points as a rate of sales in the quarter, but we believe a longer view on operating margin is a more meaningful indicator of our business and our strategy. Excluding fuel and charges for labor unrest in the first quarter of 2007, Kroger's operating margin for the first two quarters of fiscal 2008 declined 8 basis points; 6 basis points of this decline can be tied to the higher LIFO expense in the first half of this fiscal year versus last year. Hold onto this thought because in a few minutes, when I discuss our updated 2008 guidance, it will help you understand why we are still predicting a flat or slightly improving nonfuel operating margin on an annual basis. Kroger's tax rate for the quarter was 36.5% compared to 38.2% in the prior year. The current year rate benefited from a favorable resolution of certain tax issues, whereas an unfavorable resolution of certain tax issues in 2007 affected the prior year rate. We now anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 37%.  Total debt increased $1 billion to $7.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2007. This represents a decline of $176 million from the first quarter of 2008. Our net total debt to EBITDA ratio has improved to 1.9 times compared to 1.95 at the end of the first quarter of 2008 and 2.03 at the end of fiscal 2007. We expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to show slight improvement over time. This assumes capital investments of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2008, consistent with our prior guidance. It also assumes that we will use our current share repurchase authorization over the next six to nine months. We are exploring some good opportunities to buy real estate we currently lease. If those opportunities are realized, our capital expenditures and debt levels could increase. This would be offset by lower rent expense. Before I turn to our updated guidance, I know several of you are interested in some data points about our retail fuel operations. Recall that in the second quarter of last year we experienced stronger than usual fuel margins. Consequently, we anticipated a tough comparison in the second quarter this year. But as wholesale fuel prices declined through much of the summer, we saw some expansion in our fuel margins. This expansion reflects our typical experience in this business.  As a general rule, when wholesale fuel costs are rising, our margins tend to contract inversely when wholesale costs are declining, our margins in this business expand. This relationship makes it difficult to forecast the quarterly margin of our retail fuel operations, but over a longer time frame fuel margins normalize and that is why we manage this business from an annual perspective. Cents per gallon data for the second quarter and on a rolling four-quarter basis illustrates my point. For the second quarter, the cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience store and supermarket fuel centers was $0.179 cents compared to $0.162 in the prior year. On a rolling four-quarter basis, cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.12 this year compared to $0.128 last year.  Now let's discuss Kroger's updated 2008 guidance. I want to point out that these expectations are before the effect of Hurricane Ike. As announced in our earnings release this morning, we raised the low end of the range of our annual identical sales guidance. We now expect identical sales growth of 4.5% to 5.5% excluding fuel for fiscal 2008.  We confirmed our annual earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.90 per diluted share. Note that this confirmed guidance contains a full year LIFO charge estimate that is $30 million higher than the estimate we shared with you back in June when we reported Kroger's first quarter results. We now anticipate a full year LIFO charge of $160 million. We increased our estimate due to the latest projections we have for grocery and produce prices at the end of the year. Our outlook on dairy prices has not changed materially since we discussed our LIFO estimate with you back in June. Recall that our actual LIFO expense for 2008 will be determined in the fourth quarter based on inflation rates and inventory mix at that time.  We expect that our annual earning per share growth will be driven by a combination of strong identical sales, a flat to slightly improved operating margin excluding fuel, and fewer shares outstanding.  We expect some operating margin expansion in the second half of the year tied to the timing of our LIFO expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007 we recorded a full year LIFO charge of $154 million. Of that full year expense, $94 million was recorded in the second half of the year, with over one-third of the full year expense recorded in the fourth quarter alone. For the current year, we have already recognized a little over half of our expected $160 million LIFO expense. We expect this timing issue will bring some operating margin leverage during the back half of fiscal 2008 and in the fourth quarter, particularly.  We've included the possibility of a flat non-fuel operating margin in the event we encounter continued inflationary pressures in key items.  Now turning back to Kroger's earnings per share guidance for a moment, I want to remind investors that our earnings guidance of $1.85 to $1.90 per diluted share reflects 9% to 12% growth over fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.69 per diluted share. Kroger's dividend rate yield of more than 1% further enhances shareholder return. That's a solid return in several economic environments, and especially in the current market.  Although it is not our practice to give quarterly guidance, I want to discuss some items that affected our quarterly results last year to help you adjust your financial models for the second half of fiscal 2008. We continue to expect solid results from our core grocery operations, but I want to remind investors, as we've stated throughout the year, we anticipate Kroger's lowest year-over-year earnings per share growth rate will occur in the third quarter. Third quarter results last year included a $40 million tax benefit. We used some of this benefit to offset low fuel margins and to accelerate some strategic investments we had scheduled in our business plan for later periods. A portion of this tax benefit also benefited our bottom line. The net effect of our third quarter results was income of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share. As a result, we expect that Kroger's earnings per share in the third quarter this year will range from slightly below to slightly above prior year results. After adjusting the prior year net benefit, this would represent an increase in this year's expected third quarter earnings per share.  As we have shared with you previously, we continue to expect that our fourth quarter earnings per share growth rate will be higher than the company's annual earnings per share growth rate, driven by solid results from our core grocery operation as well as the LIFO timing issue I described earlier. As I mentioned earlier, the third and fourth quarter expectations that I have just described exclude any impact from Hurricane Ike. The Hurricane and its remnants affected Kroger operations in Texas and several inland states, particularly Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. The financial impact of the hurricane will not be significant enough to cause us to alter our strategy. The final result of the damage and the disruption from the storm could affect much of the guidance we discuss today. A more detailed description of the potential impact on Kroger's guidance and the explanation of our insurance programs are included in the 8-K we filed today. I'll wrap up with some comments on labor relations. During the quarter we reached agreement with unions representing our associates in Columbus and Nashville. Other negotiations we are engaged in this year cover store associates in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Portland. In every negotiation we work to achieve competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates' needs for good wages and affordable health care.  Now I'll turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
David B. Dillon:  We had a solid quarter. Our long-term investments in our people, our prices and our stores pay off in this type of environment. Still, we know there are challenges ahead. Our associates in every area of our business focused on executing our customer-first strategy to meet the changing needs of today's shoppers. As a company, we are committed to delivering the results we have forecasted for the year. Now we'd be happy to take a few moments to answer your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.:  A quick question just on the gas margins. I know you tried to give some color on the rolling fourth quarter or 4Q gas margins, obviously, and gave the numbers for this quarter. Could you just tell us what the gas margins were in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year?
W. Rodney McMullen: We will when we release third and fourth quarter, but I don't remember those off the top of my head. Sorry.
David B. Dillon:  We thought the rolling four quarters would give you a good enough sense of what a full year looks like.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: And then I guess the second question I had is do you have some sense of what the generic impact is on your IDs or what it was this quarter versus last year and I guess versus the first quarter?
David B. Dillon: If you look for the quarter versus last year, pharmacy generics impacted our identicals in total by about 0.5%. 
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: And then I guess just comments in general on what you're seeing from the competition. I mean, you know, if you kind of look at the landscape, it seems that your conventional competitors are getting a lot more focused on offering value and obviously they're several years behind you in terms of that initiative. But, you know, can you give us some color on what your thinking is in terms of the competitive landscape as you kind of deal with that?
David B. Dillon:  Well, it probably won't help you very much but we see the competitive landscape as continuing to be challenging. It's interesting in the dynamic of the changing economy and in particular the changing consumer behavior, and I'm sure each of the competitors are trying to read that and address it based on their own particular business model. We're much more focused on our customers and responding to our customers than we are focused on trying to respond to any particular competitor, and as a result I don't think it's likely that we'll comment on specific competitors.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes, I wouldn't in terms of addressing specific competitors, but obviously this is a journey that we embarked upon several years ago. And we feel like we have a great lead in terms of investing pricing for our customers and using the data that we have from dunnhumby and our loyalty data in segmenting our stores. So we feel very good about where we are positioned and we continue to move even more aggressively on improving where we are.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: And is there any geographic pattern to where the markets might be more challenging? Are you seeing anything that's discernable?
David B. Dillon:  There's certainly some geographic patterns but every quarter that tends to shift based on what's happening in various markets. Some markets - if you just look, as an example, just look at unemployment rates across the country - it is quite variable from one market to another and as a result we're going to see each market as a little different. And so we do see some variability. But we have quite a few of our markets that are performing very well and a few that are a little more challenged. But if you look at across all regions of the country, we would be positive meaningfully on identicals. Now, the area that I mentioned that, on discretionary items, you can clearly see consumer behavior changes there, and that's not unique to a region. That's really for all those discretionary categories. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Right.
Operator: Your next question comes from Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: In this environment, you really seem to be widening the gap with the competition. Do you think that you're gaining sales from new customers or gaining a greater share of Wal-Mart from existing customers?
David B. Dillon:  I don't think we try to pinpoint who it's coming from as much as it's coming from our customers. And, as you know, we target our existing customer base because of the opportunity we see, that in even our very best customers, there's still a lot of purchases they make outside of Kroger and, by targeting them, we have had very good results. And, of course, they tell their neighbors and then some of their neighbors who are not shopping as much with us start shopping with us. So it's obviously both of those factors, but I don't think we try to identify where we're picking that up from.
W. Rodney McMullen: But it's certainly, if you look at it from a transaction standpoint and customer count standpoint, it looks pretty evenly matched between the two in terms of where we're getting our growth, and that's pretty consistent with prior quarters when you look at that data.
David B. Dillon:  Yes, when we've looked at that data, too, we have to be mindful that there's some inflation in the average sale. But both are up in about equal amounts.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: And then secondly, Rodney also referred to higher credit card fees. Are you seeing an increased usage in terms of credit card transactions or what's happening from that line item?
David B. Dillon:  It's being driven from three perspectives - one, the higher fuel costs obviously creates a higher transaction fee, the credit card companies have raised their base fee rate, and the usage is up. So it's actually all three components that's driving that expense.
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: And then lastly, obviously in this environment, with higher fuel prices, transportation management is increasingly important. Can you talk about specific initiatives that cover has in place? 
David B. Dillon:  A couple of years ago our transportation team really worked really hard in terms of identifying some outside sources from a software standpoint to help us better manage our fleet and optimize our fleet utilization throughout out system both into our warehouses and out to our stores and maximizing the cube utilization or, you know, the amount of space that you drive around with empty, by significantly decreasing that. And that's something that our team has been working on for really over two years.  Obviously, with the higher fuel prices, the returns from those projects are even higher than what we'd thought they would be originally.
W. Rodney McMullen: Our results there really are - I think they've been outstanding despite the large increase in fuel costs, and I think they've identified - the example he gave is a good one, but there's several other smaller examples that all contribute to successfully reducing the amount of miles that we have to drive, which can help reduce the overall cost.
David B. Dillon:  If you look at our percentage increase in those expenses, the percent increase in expense is less than the change in diesel price increases, as an example.
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  I'd like to talk a little bit more about consumer behavior. You did talk about private label but I was wondering whether you're seeing consumers shopping for deals more? Any sense that there's particularly cherry picking going on or anything like that?
David B. Dillon:  Well, we identified this quarter publicly that we're seeing an increase in sales in our value-oriented stores, and that's a reasonably recent phenomenon in the last three to six months, where we've seen some increases there that were discernibly different than the past pattern. That would suggest, to me at least, is that people are seeking out value, particularly in those pockets of our stores that are focused more on the value customer.  But we're also seeing other trends which we've identified. For instance, we believe people are combining trips, which makes a combo store really good, in order to reduce the amount of fuel that they use. Our gas offer is still getting good uptake from the customers. That's still very popular, and I think that's being driven, of course, by the high price of gas and people are seeking out the opportunity. And we obviously have commented about the less use of restaurants. Consumers clearly are eating at home more often and buying their food at supermarkets, ours and other supermarkets, too.  And then the only other clear trend that we've identified is some additional softness in discretionary items that we've wanted to call out. That, of course, shows up primarily - not entirely, but primarily in drug GM department sales. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: And if you could talk a little bit about the trend of sales in the quarter, because I believe you had started out pretty strong and then it clearly, just to do the math, it must have softened in the latter two months, but then the trend seems to be picking up again in the beginning of the third quarter. So maybe just - I'm sure it's very volatile, but if you see any patterns at all.
David B. Dillon:  It is. In the quarter, the 4.7%, on the whole, we thought, were good results. They were pretty close to the kind of longer-term trend we've been running of about 5%. The last several weeks of the quarter, though, were the weakest. There's lots of reasons, we think, for that, although you have to speculate a little bit. Among them, though, we're pretty sure would include softness in some of the discretionary items, seasonal and probably back-to-school would have begun to be impacted at that timeframe, too. So that's the picture. And we thought it would be helpful, as a result, to identify the first four weeks of the third quarter as trending about 5%, and the reason we wanted to do that is to illustrate that that trend at the end of the quarter was not continuing on into this quarter.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: And then I'd just like to talk a little bit about labor. And I think you got this question last quarter, but are you beginning to feel like there are changes in the discussion from the unions about sort of how to allocate the dollars? Are they, you know, really asking for higher wages and accepting an offset in terms of benefits?
W. Rodney McMullen: Not really. The focus still in most of our negotiations, although I should quickly add that every market is different, it's really tailored to the needs in that particular market, but generally speaking we're seeing benefits and pension as the two primary issues that need to be addressed, to find some way to reconcile the high cost of those areas with the genuine needs of our associates.  And as we've tried to approach negotiations, we really try to approach them in a balanced way. We want our associates to end up feeling good about the outcome and, of course, we need to have our costs contained in a way that's effective for us to continue to serve the customer. So I would say we're not seeing any particular change today from where we were in the last six months or so on those negotiations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Neil Currie - UBS.
Neil Currie - UBS:  I just wanted to ask a question about inflation. You mentioned a 4.9% increase in product cost. How does that translate on the sales line once you take into account a changing basket and increased private label? I'm trying to get a feel as to how much volume growth there may have been in the quarter.
David B. Dillon: Well, it's a little bit difficult to read. If it had just simply been throughout the grocery department, you could probably just do the math and come out that way. You still can do that and should recognize that the higher the inflation, of course, the lower our tonnage.  We did see some tonnage gain in total tonnage for the quarter. We did see some tonnage gain there. But because of the softness in some of the areas we've identified and because of that inflation, there's not the kind of tonnage gain in it that we had previously had. With that inflation we're seeing success in being able to pass along costs. And one other thing you've got to think about is that in produce, particularly in a fresh food department like produce, you'll see high variability in what people purchase. And what we saw in inflation - as we noted, it was double-digit inflation in produce during the quarter - and you see high volatility in the pricing, and you see quite a bit of change in mix of what people buy because if one thing is higher priced, they buy something different. And as a result, it's a little bit harder to track dollar for dollar and track it back to tonnage in produce. But in the other departments, I think it's pretty fair just to do the math and see where we are. Clearly, that's been a change for us and, I think, in the whole supermarket industry over time.  One other thing we probably ought to note - and Rodney noted this in his comments - is that as the prices go up, with prices being passed along and inflation, it will tend to have a dampening effect on our gross margin unless, of course, you were to get the full percentage gross margin that you were achieving before. It ends up sort of falsely indicating that your gross margin is declining when in fact what's happening is you're raising some of the prices on those costs that have increased.
W. Rodney McMullen: I don't know if this helps but if you look at our tonnage growth, it was meaningfully more than if you just took identical sales minus inflation.
Neil Currie - UBS: Yes, that's what I was trying to get at.
W. Rodney McMullen: Tonnage growth was meaningfully more than that, and the thing that makes it so hard - and internally we talk about this all the time because of the things that Dave talked about, where you have mix changes - and we know as you have inflation in produce it's real clear to see somebody switching from buying one item to buying bananas or something. When you look at grocery, you can see shifts from people buying a national brand to a private label or corporate brand item. So you can see those types of shifts, but it's really hard to decided, you know, how much of it really fits into where. But when you look at tonnage growth at the end of the day, it was meaningfully more than what just netting those two numbers would get you. 
Neil Currie - UBS: That's what I suspected. I suspected that the product cost number you gave was a base-weighted basket and, you know, when you look at a current weighted basket and how the basket changes that you're actually seeing some volume growth.
David B. Dillon:  Yes.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes.
Neil Currie - UBS: Just another thing, if I may. Obviously market share is never always a one-way street and there are gains and losses from various different retailers and restaurants, etc. At the lower end of the scale, do you feel as if the Value products are protecting that lower-income customer from going to super centers or dollar stores or are you seeing some slippage there?
David B. Dillon:  Well, I don't know that I can answer for sure, but the mere fact that our Value-oriented stores are showing noticeable improvement in sales picture would suggest that we're at a minimum holding our own and probably actually gaining a little share in that segment of the business.
Neil Currie - UBS: Oh, just to come back to the previous question asked, I'm sorry, in terms of that tonnage growth, how would you say that compared against the first quarter?
W. Rodney McMullen: It would be a little bit lower, but not substantially lower.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation:  I'd like to start out, you were talking about some of these properties, these store properties, you lease. You said you might be buying them. What's sort of driving that? Is it the real estate market?
W. Rodney McMullen: For the most part it's the real estate market. There's one specific property that's on the market right now that would be a pretty big expenditure if we could buy it, and that would be more opportunistic because it's available. But as a general rule it's just because of the weakness in the financial markets and when somebody has an asset to sell, especially if it's a store where we want to expand, it works out really well to buy that property and be able to expand the store.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: You say it'd be a fairly big expenditure. Are you talking about a group of stores or [inaudible] location or what?
W. Rodney McMullen: As of right now they're all one-off type transactions but, I mean, if every one of them came to be, you could see where it could be $100 or $200 million. But I don't want you to assume that that's going to happen because not everything always happens.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: I understand. I understand. It's the function of the marketplace and you think your balance sheet allows you to take advantage of it, I guess. How about on the acquisitions, some end-market acquisitions? Are those opportunities looking anymore likely these days?
David B. Dillon:
 : We continue to look at quite a few things, but I really don't see a trend change there at all at this point. You know, the valuations are much more reasonable, but people that don't have to sell usually don't like the current valuations.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: So you guys still remain very price conscious?
David B. Dillon:  You know, one of the things that - as you know, you've known us for a long time - we would do the same analysis in today's world as we would, you know, two years ago when the market was rocking and rolling. So our valuation wouldn't change as much as what the market might suggest from an external standpoint. 
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Now if we were to look at, say, just your Fred Meyer and Marketplace stores, can you comment on the general merchandise sales trends in those formats?
David B. Dillon: Well, the point we made earlier on discretionary spending, particularly in drug GM - in fact, we identified drug GM department - was flat on sales in the quarter on an identical basis, and we identified that for that reason. And of course we would have disproportionately high dollar sales in that department in the Marketplace stores and in the Fred Meyer stores. So that comment would particularly apply to them.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: So that might suggest they were seeing down sales in those categories and flat across the entire company. Would that be accurate?
David B. Dillon:  No. If you look at those categories when you look at the whole company, it's flat. And when you look at - those businesses would still be growing nicely, but it would be driven by the grocery side of the store.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Well, I was just referring to the GM side of those, Fred Meyer and Marketplace stores, suggesting that the sales trends would be down on the general merchandise side.
David B. Dillon: It wouldn't really be that much different than where the whole company is on - flat. You can find some specific categories that would be down, but when you look at overall, flat is a pretty good assumption.
W. Rodney McMullen: It would have a little bit bigger effect on the total sales in those divisions, in those areas, because they have a higher percentage of their business coming from the drug GM department. That's certainly true. 
David B. Dillon:  But if you look at the impact on identicals for all of Kroger, we think it's 0.1% to 0.15% or 10 to 15 basis points when you look at all of Kroger, just to give you a scale of the number.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: And then I tried to quickly go through the 8-K regarding the discussion on insurance coverage relative to hurricane damage. It looks like in total here you've got about a $50 million deductible. Is that correct?
J. Michael Schlotman: No, it's one deductible of $25 million since it's one store system. There's $725 million of coverage for business interruption and wind. In our program, there's a $500 million sub-limit for flood. Both of those coverages are subjected to the same $25 million retention.
Charles Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: And the coverage includes or would be applied to lost sales and earnings, damaged buildings and lost inventory?
J. Michael Schlotman: Correct. But also cover extra expenses to get stores back up and running. For example, if we went out and rented a bunch of generators to get the store open, those are considered extra expenses and it would pick up that kind of a claim as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company:  Dave, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about dunnhumby. You talked about this briefly in your prepared remarks, but how maybe within this environment you've been able to glean incremental insights from a macro context on your business that you might not have had in prior cycles, and maybe how that has enabled you to respond a little quicker because of that, if you can talk and give us some examples. I know you've given some just from the environment itself, but maybe from that application and what's that providing for you competitively if you can provide some color. 
David B. Dillon:  Well, I'll provide a little bit of color perhaps. On a macro basis we try to take several different looks and vantage points at our customers. For instance, we segment - one of the ways we've looked at it is to look at customers who are shopping more with us, buying more items with us now than they were, and try to look at their behavior and what's important to them. We look at a group of customers who are maybe buying less items from us. And we look at a group of customers whose behavior hasn't changed.  And it allows us to see lots of different things in terms of the decision points they make based on decisions we made about promoting. We look at the kind of promotions we run in our ads and see what kind of reaction we get based on those various segments and see whether or not we're getting the behavior we'd like to get.  Take the tax rebate program that we did as an example. We continue to track customers who took advantage of that to see what the long-term trends of that would be. We made a big investment, of course, to give them the discount on certificates, but we want to get a sense of what does that mean to the long-term shopping behavior of that customer. And it's too early to tell that, of course, but we're tracking that as an example. So those would be a few illustrations that would give you an idea how we use it. I don't think I'm prepared to give outstanding specifics that would give you any more detail than that. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, one other thing that is a little bit longer term but dunnhumby has helped us a lot in terms of understanding how to serve all customer segments and what all customer segments want. And, you know, we've done a lot of work, our merchandising teams have done a ton of work and our divisions to position us to serve all customers. And as customers change, they change segment, and we're already doing work to serve a value customer better, so we get a double benefit from that. And that's something that started happening several years ago, not something that's just happened in the current economic environment.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company: So you can see with a little bit more granularity within your customer segments the trading effect, the channel shift, the impact of inflation, if I'm catching you. And is there any sort of competitive behavior that you can interpret from all that, either from what your peers in the conventional grocery channel are doing or in the mass and club channel as people seek out value, which is clearly happening in the last three to six months, as you mentioned.
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, we could look at some patterns that would be helpful from a competitive point of view, but we're not likely to describe them today. 
David B. Dillon:  But if you look at our strength, our strength would be against all competitors. It just wouldn't be with one particular competitor.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse:  I have a question about your gift card promotion that you ran a few months ago. Now that the program's over and you've had a chance to sort of assess the program, in looking at the margin and sales impact, can you sort of help us understand the impact that it's had there as well as whether you think that program ultimately has been a success or not?
David B. Dillon:  Well, I mentioned in Jason's question a little bit about the tax rebate gift card program, but let me just add a little bit more. In the quarter we had around $22 million in expense, and you should think of that as basically cash that we gave to the customers. It also reduces the sales and sales as reported so, in other words, when we sell a card for $300, we gave $330 worth of goods or value on the card and we only ring up $300 worth of sales even though we gave $330 in value. So it has a dampening effect on the sales a bit. Of course, it would hit the margins a little bit. And based on the behavior that we've tracked on the customers, it would appear to us that the lift that we received from those customers during the quarter did cover that $22 million expense. But time will tell in the long run whether or not it was a long-term good investment. And that's the reason, as I'd mentioned to Jason, that we continue to track the customer behavior who purchased those cards.
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: And is it possible to quantify the impact of the lower pre-open and transition costs from Farmer Jack and Scott's? 
J. Michael Schlotman: We don’t have it right off the top. 
W. Rodney McMullen: It's not a humongous number, but it's a meaningful number. But I know that doesn't help you too much. Ed, it's $8 million. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse: On commodity costs, you know, we've been seeing commodity costs come down a bit. I know there's a lag there between the time those costs come down and they begin to impact package [inaudible] companies because they had a hedge, but is there a chance here that, you know, we look at inflation at the end of the year when you do your calc on the LIFO charge and that it's lower than where we are today?
David B. Dillon:  Well, let me just comment that if you look at the rate of inflation, LIFO's calculated just purely at a spot market at the end of the year. And it's our estimate. We try to project out where we think the year end will be, and that is what we end up with our charge and that's how we revised it in this quarter. One issue for us is commodity costs do appear that they may be declining and that would be good news, I think. But in addition to that we still have fuel costs to contend with because suppliers embed it in their inflation, which they pass onto us, would be higher costs than what we had the year before on diesel fuel to get the goods to our warehouse. And that would be embedded and what we would see as product cost inflation.
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, the only other thing is that we always - the inflation that we see from the CPGs always lag what the commodity cost increases would be. So we have no idea how long that flow-through will last because usually it lags a couple of quarters on seeing it. We would expect going down it probably would take a couple of quarters. But as Dave mentioned when he was going through his prepared remarks, it's one of the benefits of having our own manufacturing plants and having such a strong corporate brand program. We get the benefit of those reductions in cost immediately so that it's a great opportunity to pick up share and provide a great value for our customer as those costs come down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  I wanted to ask a little bit about package sizing from the consumer package goods companies. We've seen a lot of the companies raising their prices by shrinking package sizes. Have the consumers really picked up on this and can you see any change in demand trends there? And does that in any way effect how you go to market with some of your private label offerings?
David B. Dillon:  Well, you, of course, are correct. Many of the CPG companies have done that. They, of course, do a lot of research with consumers before they do it, and as a result are generally reasonably sure they're not going to have much impact when they do it. Most of those packages, as best we can tell, have been reasonably well accepted in the marketplace. Our private label brands, Kroger brands, often follow suit when we think it's a good idea, but there's a few times when we have not. We make a deliberate, intentional choice in those cases. And I would say no, we're not seeing much change in consumer behavior as a result of that change.
W. Rodney McMullen: A couple of years ago, we had one example where somebody didn't - everybody decreased the size of their product except for one, and the one that didn't did not pick up share even though their pricing was the same. So it appears at this point that the sizing change really doesn't affect customer behavior as much as what probably any of us would guess.
David B. Dillon:  Obviously, there's an end to that. I mean, there is a point at which you get diminishing returns. But we haven't seen it yet. Put it that way.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yes, we joke about at some point there'll be a super size ice cream. It'll be a half a gallon again. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley:  In our surveys on price we did in July, we found that you were much sharper on your private label pricing on the low end, but it sounds like from your comments that your fastest-growing brand is your prestige brand in private label. Maybe just comment how the Value brands are doing.
W. Rodney McMullen: The Value brands are actually doing really well. We're having good increases there. And you could certainly discern what's happening with customers because of that. But I ought to be quick to point out that our whole corporate brand program has worked well. We've identified before a number of changes we've made there, the way we're trying to address the market, both our marketing and the quality we're putting in the packaging and the quality in the products and all of our plans there have improved. And one illustration of that is that actually a little bit more than half of the increase in items sold in the quarter were our Private Selections and Private Selection Organic products. And those are not targeted at Value customers particularly, and we're seeing customers across all income streams interested in that product. So it suggests that there are several things going on here in our improved corporate brand mix, and it's not just the economy. In fact, I would argue it's actually more the marketing efforts that we've applied to it and some effect by the economy.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: So in those cases where you're going for the Organics or the Private Selections, people are just trying to add value, maybe enhance what they're getting for that price point?
David B. Dillon:  Yes. And in some cases there's not a comparable product in the national brands to compete with the Private Selection items and as a result it's just a great product.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott A. Mushkin - Banc of America Securities, LLC.
Scott A. Mushkin - Banc of America Securities, LLC:  I just wanted to see, I mean, clearly your business model's worked really well with consumers being under a lot of pressure and inflation rising. Your price leadership, kind of like Wal-Mart, is really paying off for you. Take us forward like six to 12 months, assuming that the commodity prices continue to evaporate, unemployment goes way up, you know, how does the business model work when we see maybe no price increases?
David B. Dillon:  Well, we were specific to say in our comments that we think our business model works in any conceivable picture that we can describe anyway. We think it works well because it's tailored to the customer at that time and in their particular situation. One of the reasons we talked about the corporate brands program on the high end, the Private Selections and PS Organics, and the growth we've had there is I think that illustrates something that is sort of outside of the trends in the economy today and a consumer that's maybe pinched. It illustrates that there are lots of things that we're doing that are paying off with other customers, too. So if, as you describe, those were to occur, we think we're well positioned. And in fact, if you want to roll the clock backwards maybe two years and you'd have an environment much like what you just described, and we were rocking and rolling then. So I would say that that would paint what the picture might look like.
Scott A. Mushkin - Banc of America Securities, LLC: Are you seeing any market - because we think the Northeast market, which you guys don't participate in, is getting, you know, very, very competitive. We see actually people holding the line on price and not passing them along at all. Are you seeing any markets like that and is it, you know, are you still feeling very comfortable with how your business performs when other people get really aggressive to try to hold their traffic?
David B. Dillon:  This is obviously a challenging environment. The customers are challenged and so forth. But given that picture, I'm very bullish with what I'm seeing in our business. I feel very good about it. Having said that, I do think that we have several markets that, on selected items, we'll see some competitive actions where they may hold the line. As we've pointed out, we've increased our prices as we've had costs go up, but we've not maintained - intentionally have not maintained - the percentage of margin we had. We've exceeded, though, the penny's profit that we had, which of course helps pays the bills of other items that have accelerated in inflation, too. So I think on the whole I don't see it entirely different today than it was last quarter when we described it, and I feel pretty good about the position.
Scott A. Mushkin - Banc of America Securities, LLC: Just one follow up on the tonnage. As you looked at the third quarter sales, the 5% acceleration, did you have any feel about what inflation was doing there or did you feel that the tonnage and the traffic were the same as you looked at the 5%, the little bit of acceleration in the first four weeks of the third quarter?
W. Rodney McMullen: It would be pretty similar to what we saw in the first and second quarters both, pretty much equal. 
Operator: Your last question comes from Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Dave, you mentioned it's been 20 years since the industry's seen rapid inflation, at least on the CPG side. Given that, you know, I see your inventories are up a lot less than the inflation rate and, in years past, the way I've thought of the industry, it might have been just the opposite. You might have seen big retailers engaged in forward buying to get in front of price increases. So a two-part question: Is that something we might want to look for, look for some increases in your inventories as you engage in that kind of forward buying to keep your cost of goods down? And related to that or if not, what other ways are you working with suppliers? I mean, you mentioned small package size, but what other ways do you work with suppliers to try to lower your cost of goods sold?
David B. Dillon:  Let me answer it this way. First, the way we work with suppliers, we've done a variety of things. Some of the things we're doing are trying to reduce the cost to bring products to market, and that's actually been very successful with several suppliers. It takes cooperative work and I think we have several homeruns, but none of them are so large as to move the needle by themselves. But cumulatively over time they actually generate some value. Now as to how we buy in an inflationary environment, of course we're doing some forward buys. We'd be, I think, crazy not to. But the total dollars of forward buy would not be enough for you to really see it on our balance sheet because we have such a large amount of inventory.  And one of the reasons you don't see it is that the opportunity for forward buy today is a little bit less than it would have been 20 years ago. The reason for that primarily is that we now have methods of distributing products that are so efficient that you flow through and you don't want to have very many stopover points. And in forward buy, you actually take delivery of the inventory, you put it in storage, you have double handling, and you have, more importantly, the disruption of the supply chain and that can be a bit traumatic.  So I would be surprised if you would see forward buys from us or really anybody large enough to move the needle on balance sheet, but that doesn't mean we're not doing them. We are doing them, and we have actually increased them in the last quarter from the quarter before.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And just to follow up on the commodities side, the USDA and other forecasters are looking for a pretty big ramp up in protein pricing and, again, a two-parter. Just technically, is that part of your LIFO index and is that one of the reasons you raised the outlook? And secondly, similar question, what kind of forward buying can you engage in with the large protein producers to sort of get more predictability around your price, especially in protein if and when it starts to run up in price?
J. Michael Schlotman: We do have meat on LIFO, which is different than some of our competitors. Not all of our competitors that use LIFO use LIFO for meat. We did see an increase in protein prices through the quarter. It was actually negative as we ended the first quarter and accelerated in inflation through the quarter, and ended up the quarter with a slight bit of inflation. 
David B. Dillon:  Well, the question on procuring proteins, whether or not you take forward buy positions, do you want to comment on that, Don?
Don W. McGeorge: Not so much calling it or labeling it forward buy, but we do negotiate with some manufacturers or suppliers, if you will, for contracts that may cover extended periods of time and in effect those contracts, then, can help hedge a bit against rising costs or falling costs.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: And do you vary, let's call it a hedge ratio or the amount of product you buy forward based on your outlook, and can that be a substantial change depending upon your outlook or is it fairly constant? 
Don W. McGeorge: No, it's not so much and don't label it so much a hedge, but rather a negotiated contracted price for a period of time and/or volume.
David B. Dillon:  Before I turn to a couple of closing comments, I do want to actually have Don ask a question that no one asked because - or answer a question no one asked - because you saw we filed an 8-K, we talked a little bit about the hurricane damage through the Houston area and then up through the Midwest. And Don has a very current update on how we're doing on stores open and I thought he might want to comment briefly on that. 
Don W. McGeorge: Actually across all regions, including Texas, as of this morning we've got less than 50 stores closed, and we're quickly bringing those stores online as well.  The other thing that is of particular note is, particularly in the Houston area where the mayor there, Bill White, has asked for support, our local president there, Bill Breetz, is working with the mayor locally. We are donating ice and bottled water and so on. It'll be distributed throughout the Houston area.  And so far things look great. We continue to expect our stores back online very quickly.
Operator:  There are no further questions. 
David B. Dillon:  Let me close with these few notes. I want to second the invitation that Carin extended at the beginning of the call. We hope that you're able to join us for Kroger's 2008 investor conference. You will hear from several members of our leadership team and have a chance to observe some of our latest customer-first initiatives and programs in one of our stores, so we look forward to seeing you next month.  I want to thank you for joining us on the call and before I end the call I want to add some additional comments for our associates who are listening in today. To all of our associates in the communities that are dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, as Don pointed out, we've made great progress. We know this is a difficult time for you and your families, and we keep you in our thoughts and prayers. And we want to thank all of our associates, who are doing a tremendous job of taking care of our customers and fellow colleagues whose lives have been disrupted by this hurricane. On behalf of the entire company, we thank you for your extra effort and we appreciate your overall commitment to safety and service. Thank you all for joining us today.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2008 Kroger Company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions. Actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Before I introduce Dave, I want to remind you that our annual shareholder meeting will be webcast live on Thursday, June 26th at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. More information about the webcast is available on our website. We invite you to join us Thursday over the Internet or listen to the replay.  Now I will turn it over to David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David B. Dillon: Thank you, Carin and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us to review Kroger's first quarter 2008 financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I will begin with a brief recap of Kroger's first quarter results and our updated guidance for 2008. I’ll also discuss the progress we are making with our Customer 1st strategy. Rodney will share additional details about Kroger’s first quarter results and the 2008 guidance. Then we will be happy to take your questions. We are off to a strong start for fiscal 2008. Today we reported record earnings of $0.58 per diluted share for the quarter. Net earnings in the same period last year were $0.47 per diluted share and recall that our 2007 results included charges related to labor unrest at one of our distribution centers. This reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. First quarter sales were also strong. Total sales increased 11.5% to $23.1 billion. Identical supermarket sales increased 9.2% with fuel and 5.8% without fuel. Growth was broad-based across all geographic regions and most departments with particular strength in grocery, nutrition, and deli/bakery. Kroger’s performance during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our Customer First strategy. Our associates are connecting well with customers as our strategy continues to drive identical sales growth and create shareholder value. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are raising our identical sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2008. We now anticipate full-year identical sales growth of 4% to 5.5%, excluding fuel. Our previous guidance on identical sales growth was 3% to 5%, also excluding fuel. For earnings, the guidance we gave in March was $1.83 to $1.90 per diluted share. Today we are raising the lower end of that range to $1.85 with the upper end remaining at $1.90. In a few minutes, Rodney will share additional details on guidance. Our updated earnings guidance reflects 9% to 12% growth over fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.69 per diluted share, which is a solid growth rate in a challenging economy, plus don’t forget our dividend. This compares favorably with the most recent earnings per share growth rate for non-financial companies in the S&P 500. We continue to expect our 2008 earnings per share growth will be driven by strong identical sales, a slight improvement in our non-fuel operating margin, and fewer shares outstanding. I want to take a moment now to talk about how the economy is affecting the purchasing decisions our customers make every day. Our latest customer research indicates the two biggest concerns on shoppers’ minds today are high gas prices and food costs. These two factors are driving some of the behavior changes we are seeing lately, such as shoppers combining trips and actively pursuing gas discount offers. Our research also validates some underlying trends that we have seen for some time. These include families coming together more often to prepare and eat meals at home and the willingness of customers to try new private label products. We did see solid growth in Kroger corporate brand share in the first quarter and recall the overall strength of Kroger’s corporate brand program has been building for several years. Our unmatched line of quality private label products -- Private Selection, Store Banner and Value brands -- can only be found in Kroger’s family of stores. For more than a year, our corporate brands team has been working to expand the private label products we offer customers. Nearly half of the new corporate brand items introduced last year were under our Private Selections label. That has led to great new products, such as our Private Selections Angus Beef Steaks and Artisan bread. Today, Private Selections is our fastest-growing brand and based on the first quarter trends, Private Selections will be a $1 billion brand for Kroger in 2008. Listening closely to our customers is the foundation of our Customer First strategy. We focus intently on its four keys: our people, our products, our prices and the overall shopping experience of our customers. As a result, our strategy is helping us strengthen our connection with customers at a time when many shoppers are looking for the best options to stretch their dollars. In addition to the growing private label business, we have introduced or expanded several programs in recent months to help customers stretch their household budgets. They include: expanding our $4 generic drug program to include 90-day supplies for $10; giving customers up to $120 in free groceries when they buy Kroger gift cards through our special tax refund gift card promotion; offering discounts on gasoline -- for every $100 customers spend in our stores, they can earn $0.10 off each gallon of gas on their next fill-up. In fact, just in time for summer travel, customers can accumulate and redeem gas discounts by shopping in almost all of our stores from Virginia to Arizona to Alaska; rewarding shoppers who have a 123 REWARDS MasterCard -- customers can earn discounts up to $0.15 off each gallon of gas per fill-up in participating markets and earn free groceries every quarter by using their 123 Rewards card. So far, customers have earned $48 million in free groceries. These types of programs, and our associates’ exceptional ability to execute them well, are just some of the reasons Kroger’s business is growing. We have built the ultimate “one-stop shop” for customers in thousands of communities we serve. Our combination stores, many with in-store pharmacies and a growing number of fuel sites, help our customers combine shopping trips.  As our first quarter results show, we are making progress in our effort to be a reliable and relevant partner for customers by anticipating their needs and consistently delivering on their expectations. Through these types of investments, our customers are saving $1 billion annually. Now I would like to turn the call over to Rodney for some additional details on our first quarter results, financial strategy update, and 2008 guidance. Rodney.
W. Rodney McMullen:   Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. Dave highlighted Kroger’s strong sales and earnings for the first quarter. We realize that some investors want to know if our special tax rebate gift card promotion drove these strong results. Overall, the promotion had no material effect on Kroger’s first quarter sales or earnings. Let me give you a little more about how the promotion works.  Under this special promotion, which started May 2nd and ends July 31st, customers can receive up to $120 in free groceries from Kroger if they buy Kroger gift cards. We are evaluating this promotion internally, based on several metrics, to understand how this affecting customers' shopping behavior. So far, we are pleased with the trends we are seeing. Some investors have asked us how we are accounting for the 10% bonus associated with the promotion. While the accounting is straightforward, an example might be helpful. A customer who turns $300 into a Kroger gift card will receive a card valued at $330. Kroger recognizes sales revenue of $300 as the card is used by the customer. The $300 in revenue reflects gross sales of $330 minus the $30 discount. So the 10% bonus reduces sales and gross margin as customers use their gift cards in our stores. This is the same accounting treatment we use for other in-store promotions that are funded by Kroger. Our popular fuel discount program is another example. The cost of the fuel discount reduces our in-store sales and gross margin. If you have additional questions about how we account for these items, please follow-up with Carin offline after this conference call. It’s important to note that merchandising strategies such as our tax rebate gift card program and our expanded generic drug program are merely components of Kroger’s overall Customer First strategy to deliver value to our customers. These merchandising strategies are not incremental to our regular investments and they are contemplated in the fiscal 2008 earnings guidance Dave provided. There have also been some investor questions about the volatility of Kroger’s quarterly earnings due to fuel margins. Kroger operates over 700 supermarket fuel centers and nearly all of our 778 convenience stores sell gas. As we have said before, in the fuel business we do see margins fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Over a longer timeframe, margins in this business are more normalized. On a rolling four-quarter basis, the blended cents per gallon fuel margin for our convenience stores and supermarket fuel centers was $0.114 this year compared to $0.117 last year, a decline of $0.003 per gallon. In the first quarter of 2008, the blended cents per gallon margin was $0.092 compared to $0.087 in the prior year. While our gallons sold were up on a year-over-year basis, our retail fuel operations had no impact on Kroger’s first quarter earnings per share growth in 2008. This is largely due to the impact of higher credit card fees on fuel sales compared to the prior year. Our retail fuel business is a highly valuable asset, particularly because it strengthens our connection with customers. Our fuel centers eliminate an extra trip for shoppers and customers know they can count on a competitive fuel price at Kroger. Now let’s turn to the performance of our core grocery operations. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and the non-recurring labor expenses of the prior year, FIFO gross margin declined 5 basis points. Improvement in shrink expense helped fund continued investments in good prices for our customers. Kroger’s supermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 9 basis points year-over-year. Like many food retailers, Kroger continues to experience product cost inflation at levels not seen in several years. We estimate that our product cost inflation during the quarter was 3.5% excluding fuel. This relatively high inflation rate is reflected in our $40 million LIFO charge in this quarter. This amount is almost $20 million higher than the previous year and reduced Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin by 9 basis points.  The year-over-year increase in LIFO mainly reflects the timing of when inflation affected our business in 2008 compared to 2007. Recall that our full-year LIFO charge for fiscal 2007 was $154 million after rising product cost inflation caused us to increase our LIFO charge estimate every quarter last year.  If that full-year expense had been recognized ratably during the year, our LIFO charge for the first quarter of 2007 would have been more consistent with our current experience. I’ll talk more about LIFO in a minute when I provide some additional color on our 2008 earnings guidance. As you know, the LIFO charge is a non-cash expense that results from the company’s choice of accounting method for its product inventories. But beyond the mechanics of the LIFO charge, we realize that what many investors want to understand is how inflation is affecting our business. On the whole, as we have said several times, we believe that a moderate level of food inflation is a positive for our business. At moderate levels, we are generally able to pass suppliers’ product cost increases on to customers without negatively impacting unit volume. And we get the benefit of the additional sales leverage over fixed costs in our business. We would describe current levels of product cost inflation as moderate. Some of that additional sales leverage is reflected in our OG&A rate. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, OG&A declined 17 basis points. The improvement in our OG&A rate is primarily due to strong identical sales leverage. We also benefited from lower benefit costs associated with some labor contracts. While the effect of this particular benefit will diminish over time, we continue to identify other ways to reduce operating costs as part of our ongoing strategy. A great example of our success in this area are the initiatives we have in place to control our utility costs. Since 2000, we have reduced overall energy consumption by over 22%, or 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power every single family home in Denver, Colorado for a year. Many thanks to our associates who made this possible. You can read more about our energy reduction and recycling efforts later this week when our new sustainability report is published online at Kroger.com. Let’s continue down the income statement with operating margins. During the quarter, Kroger’s non-fuel operating margin expanded 2 basis points. This also excludes the non-recurring labor expense in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2008 earnings guidance incorporates a slight expansion in Kroger’s non-fuel operating margins on a full-year basis. Our tax rate for the quarter was 37%, compared to 38.1% in the prior year. The first quarter rate was lower in the current year due to the resolution of certain tax issues. We now anticipate a full-year tax rate in the range of 37% to 37.5%. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions, totaled $637 million, compared to $556 million in the prior year. We continue to project fiscal 2008 capital spending of $2 billion to $2.2 billion, excluding acquisitions. This investment is expected to cover 70 to 80 major store projects and 175 to 200 store remodels, plus other investments to support our Customer First strategy. Our 2008 capital budget also includes approximately $160 million for several high-return projects in Kroger’s logistics network. These projects will cause our logistics capital spending in 2009 to be higher than normal as well. Turning now to free cash flow, Kroger remains committed to a solid investment grade rating. Our long-term financial strategy is to manage free cash flow to repurchase shares and pay dividends, while maintaining a leverage ratio that supports our investment grade rating. On a rolling four-quarter basis, Kroger’s net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.95, compared with 1.85 during the same period last year and 2.03 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. So you can see that since year-end, we’ve improved our ratio. Total debt was $7.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from a year earlier. Our share repurchase and dividend programs delivered substantial value to shareholders. During the first quarter, Kroger returned over $430 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Of this amount, $381 million was invested to repurchase 15 million shares of stock at an average price of $25.46 per share. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $644 million remained under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in January 2008. At current share prices, we expect this amount will be sufficient to fund repurchases through the remainder of fiscal 2008. Kroger paid nearly $50 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter, compared to $46 million during the same period of the prior year. I want to now turn back to updated 2008 earnings guidance Dave shared with you. As we mentioned, we are raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance from $1.83 to $1.85. The upper end remains the same at $1.90 per share. Given Kroger’s strong first quarter results, some of you may wonder why we did not raise the upper end of our earnings per share guidance. There are several moving pieces to our thought-process, so let me walk you through several of the highlights. First, there is uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook for the remainder of 2008 and how it will affect our customers. So far, we have not seen major shifts in our customers’ purchasing behavior. Our strong identical sales trends have continued through the four weeks of our second quarter. We are tracking at the high end of our updated identical sales guidance for 2008. As Dave described, we are doing everything we can to help customers stretch their budgets. With over 7 months to go in our fiscal year, it is too early to make predictions as to how continued economic pressures will affect customers. Second, like many businesses, Kroger is facing headwinds in the form of higher energy-related operating costs such as diesel fuel, utility expenses, and even higher bag costs. In the first quarter, Kroger’s strong sales performance and the lower benefit costs associated with some labor contracts allowed us to absorb these higher costs and report strong earnings growth. While we expect our strong identical sales growth trend will continue, the effect of reduced health care costs will diminish over time. The third factor is LIFO, which could actually help mitigate some of our higher energy-related operating costs in the back half of 2008, based on our current estimates. Our updated 2008 earnings guidance incorporates a full-year LIFO charge of $130 million, which is about $25 million lower than 2007 and the preliminary estimate for 2008, which we provided in March. Our current expectation declined from our original 2008 projection largely due to current commodity outlooks that suggest dairy prices will be lower at the end of the year. Our actual LIFO expense for 2008 will be determined in the fourth quarter, based on inflation rates at that time. Given the current challenging economic environment, we believe that an EPS growth rate of 9% to 12% over fiscal 2007, plus the dividend yield of slightly over 1%, should be a positive for Kroger to deliver solid value to shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term health of our business. Kroger’s first quarter results and our annual guidance reflect the balance required for our long-term sustainable business model. Although we do not give quarterly guidance, please keep in mind our comments in March on quarterly earnings per share growth rates. We said that the first quarter growth rate would be higher than the annual growth rate. Clearly that forecast was accurate. We also said that the fourth quarter growth rate would be higher than the annual growth rate. The lowest year-over-year growth rate will likely occur in the third quarter due to last year’s tax benefit, which benefited Kroger’s third quarter results by roughly $0.02 to $0.03 per share on a net basis. I’ll wrap up with some comments on labor relations. During the quarter, we reached agreements in Memphis and Louisville and last week our associates in Indiana ratified a new agreement. I understand that we reached an agreement in Nashville yesterday, subject to employee ratification. This year, we have labor negotiations covering store associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Portland. In every negotiation, we work to achieve competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates’ needs for good wages and affordable health care. Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2008. Kroger’s performance during the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our Customer First strategy. Our associates are connecting well with customers as our strategy continues to drive industry-leading identical sales growth and create shareholder value. The underlying strength of Kroger’s long-term business model is illustrated by our solid first quarter results and updated guidance. We continue to balance investments in our customers’ overall shopping experience with current economic conditions, including inflationary costs. Now, we would be happy to take a few moments for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will be from the line of John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things -- how would you break the comp down between traffic and ticket? It looks like traffic is actually fairly robust. 
David B. Dillon: If you look, in the first quarter it’s pretty consistent with the way it’s been for the last couple of years. It’s slightly favorable to traffic versus ticket but not hugely so. It’s about 55% one, 45% the other, so as you can see, it’s pretty balanced between the two. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: And then within ticket, what do you see with the number of items that make up someone’s basket? Obviously there’s some inflation there. Are there less items per basket or about the same?
David B. Dillon: It would be about the same, and as we’ve said before you can see it in -- a cut-back in certain discretionary items, that you can see but certainly if you look at the food side, it’s great growth there. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: And the -- if you look at price elasticity, we’ve talked about this before, the price elasticity of the customer, the effectiveness of promotions and sometimes the elasticity is not there to get a good ROI. It would seem in this environment the elasticity is great or the ROI of price promotions is better, the money that you would spend in the circular is better. Is that true? Is the ROI tracking better than it might have in the past? What’s the color on that?
David B. Dillon: I don’t know that I’d answer it quite the way you’ve described it. I think it all depends on the promotions. Certainly in this environment, customers are responding to offers that really hit home with them, are important to them. But just as true as in the past, sometimes promotions, even in today’s environment, may not be the appropriate ones to run. So we are trying to actually balance that out pretty well and the use of data when we work with dunnhumby to evaluate our loyalty data helps us figure out which ones are the right ones to target. 
Don W. McGeorge: We would have a pretty sophisticated analysis on what are items to target and how different types of customers react to those items. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: But in general, you can’t say that the promotional spending is more efficient today because of the environment than a year ago. It sounds like it’s about the same. 
David B. Dillon: We think it’s more efficient in today’s environment because of improvements we’ve made in how we spend, not because of changes in consumer behavior.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then what would you characterize -- you said today’s inflation is moderate at 3.5. Where would it be not moderate? How high would it have to go? Is 5% not moderate? What do you think -- 
David B. Dillon: I don’t know that I’m going to speculate on that, but Rodney, do you want to go ahead on that one?
W. Rodney McMullen: With a setup like that -- I don’t know we can say the specific number. I think it really depends on how customers react and as you know, if there’s inflation that’s beyond what makes sense, that’s one of the things our wonderful corporate brand we have, we will not have those cost increases there so that does provide some offset to national brand pricing. 
David B. Dillon: I think that’s really key. The important thing for us to remember is it’s not so much how high inflation is; it’s what’s the effect on our customers and their behavior and that isn’t always able to be predicted. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: All right, and then finally in your inflation -- what you put together, most people think meat pricing, protein pricing is going to go higher later this year on into next year. Have you kind of worked that in and is that a concern, or do you think dairy will offset that?
David B. Dillon: Mike, do you want to comment?
J. Michael Schlotman: I mean, that’s exactly what we see out there as well, John, and we have factored that into our expectation for LIFO, our sales guidance, and our earnings guidance. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay, so protein is not going to push inflation higher, it will be offset by other things moderating in price?
J. Michael Schlotman: Well, that individual category we would expect to be higher. What we are looking at today is the guidance we gave you. 
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. All right, thanks. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Deborah Weinswig of Citigroup. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Congratulations on an amazing quarter. You mentioned on the call high return projects in the Kroger logistics network. Can you, without giving away any company secrets, can you elaborate on what we should expect to see in ’08 and ’09?
David B. Dillon: If you look, it’s actually over the last four or five years we’ve usually averaged one major logistics project every year. If you look at ’08 and ’09 in terms of number, it’s about the same. The difference is the areas that those warehouses are being done is a higher cost area for construction, so that’s the reason why the cost is a little higher than what it has been for the last couple of years.  In terms of specific locations, I don’t think we’ll get into that level of detail, other than saying what we are doing is consistent with some of the other projects that we’ve done and we’ve been very pleased with the financial returns we have had from those. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: So are there any new technologies or it’s just consistent with what you’ve been doing in the past?
David B. Dillon: Consistent with what we’ve been doing but you know, you’ll have to know that what we put in would be something that would be a lot of new technology relative to the U.S. You will find quite a bit of it in Europe but you don’t see much of it in the U.S., if any. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay. And then obviously with the store remodels I think numbering this year somewhere between 175 and 200, can you talk about the change that you are seeing in those stores after a remodel is complete? And maybe if you can just give us kind of some feedback in terms of what customers are saying as well?
David B. Dillon: Well, good results. We do a lot of focus group work, both before and after remodels, and our feedback has been excellent and the sales results excellent. I don’t know if you want to offer any particulars. The return on investment has been good, particularly good on remodels, actually. 
J. Michael Schlotman: The remodels are achieving above their budgeted expectations right now on sales and EBITDA. The net new stores are above the cost of capital but not all of them are at budget but that picture continues to improve. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: And then last question, obviously you gave some qualitative measures around private label and kind of with [private label flexing] about $1 billion in sales this year, how should we think about private label growth versus the rest of the store? Is there anything else you can give us in terms of actual quantification of what you’ve seen in the quarter and expect for the year?
David B. Dillon: Well, a lot of the kind of discussion we’ve heard out in just the trade has to do with the economy maybe driving people to buy more Kroger brand or private label. And while I’m certain there’s a certain degree of that going on, we actually think most of our improved results -- and our first quarter was a good improvement -- we actually think most of our improved results was because of the plan, because of the team, because of the focus we’ve had on that area.  Certainly because the share growth has grown, we have some customers who are buying more. That’s the only way you grow the share of Kroger brand, but in addition to that when we dissect some of our data and we look at our very best customers, our very best customers are buying both more Kroger brand and more national brand, not just more Kroger brand. And we take from that, we believe that the way to read that is that there’s of course a shift from restaurants and other places to buying more food in our stores. We think there’s a shift to preparing food at home more, and we think our new product introductions in the categories like the private selections that we mentioned help contribute to that.  So we think those are the primary things driving our good strong Kroger brand private label performance. But I want to remind you, this is a trend we’ve seen for several years and while the quarter was good and we certainly recognize there’s some due to the economy, we think most of it’s due to the trajectory of the work we’ve been doing. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, great, thanks. 
Don W. McGeorge: Just in terms of some of the specifics, if you look at the grocery department as an example, on retail dollars corporate brand share improved 1.4%. If you look at it on units, it improved 0.33. Obviously a 0.33 share change in one quarter is very strong, as Dave mentioned. The dollars is a little more than the units because there are inflation in several of the categories. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Great, thanks for the color and once again, congratulations. 
David B. Dillon: Thank you. In fact, Deborah, I would add just one other thing on the brand is that private selection, as we mentioned is going to be -- this year we expect it to be a $1 billion brand, and that’s more of an upscale brand. And the fact that it’s our fastest growing brand should suggest a little more evidence along the lines that I had illustrated earlier, so thank you, Deborah. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Thank you. 
Don W. McGeorge: The other -- sorry to keep adding on, but Dave talked about the long-term trend. If you look at over the last 15 quarters, corporate brand has gained in 12 of those 15 quarters, so that just shows you the consistency over time. 
Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks again. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse : Good morning and great quarter. My question for you is on your fuel business. It’s clearly a competitive advantage for you. I think you’ve got fuel in about 30% of your stores. But you mentioned that consumers are responding more to fuel promotions and I was hoping you could comment on that, as well as maybe help us dissect the performance of IDs at stores with fuel versus stores without. 
David B. Dillon: Well, the things we would really say about that is that it’s hard to know exactly what happens here but when you put a fuel station in, it gives the convenience of having fuel there at our store. We price our fuel stations really well on the street price, and so that drives some of the business too. So the mere quantity, the growth of more fuel stations certainly helps drive that and focuses squarely on the one-stop shopping idea. You were asking specifically about the fuel promotion, which I’m sure is part of this too. But I want to look at it as more of a full package because I think just the existence of the fuel is going to help us a lot.  The tie-in to the store helps remind people we have fuel and it’s been reasonably successful and you’ve seen it though at many other retailers around the country. I wouldn’t try to describe it as more significant than that. Do you want to add anything else?
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse : Could your stores that have fuel, the non-fuel IDs of those stores be 100, 200 basis points higher than stores that don’t have fuel?
David B. Dillon: I don’t think we would comment on where that would be. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse : Okay. Second question for you on rent expense, it was a little bit higher than what we were expecting this quarter. Was there anything in there one-time related, maybe associated with future lease obligations or asset impairments?
J. Michael Schlotman: There was some store closure activity in there. There were some lease buy-outs in there. Some of it was also affected when you look at it as compared to the prior year. In the prior year, we actually had some positives going the other way, which helped lower rent expense a little bit last year and some payments. We had reserves for rent liability that we were able to get out of those leases for less than a reserve with the landlord last year and that wound up being a credit in last year’s first quarter.  So when you pull that noise out, it would have been a quarter like you normally would have expected. But because of store closure activity in both years, it came away with a little bit different picture. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse : Okay. And last question for you -- could you comment on whether you are seeing any change in mix in regard to how customers are actually paying? You know, Wal-Mart recently mentioned that they’ve seen a significant shift away from credit cards, which clearly helps the gross because you lose the fee. Are you seeing any of that?
David B. Dillon: I didn’t actually look at this last quarter’s specific numbers but my impression is that we are continuing to see more of a shift towards credit card. That’s been true now for, I don’t know, 10 or 15 years and it continues down that path. 
Don W. McGeorge: And debit cards. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, debit -- I put them all together. And we’ve called out, specifically called out credit card and debit card fees, credit card in particular, both at the fuel pump because it gets escalated just purely because of the cost of fuel, because it’s on a percentage basis, which is not a very good way really to look at fuel, and also because of the increased use of the card in our stores. That has driven that fee higher and higher, which is problematic of course for us. So that’s an issue, but that’s what we are seeing. We’re not seeing the opposite. 
Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Scott [Muschkin] of Jefferies. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: I just wanted to -- Rodney talked a little bit about the union. I just wanted to get the temperature on how they are handling negotiations. We are hearing some rumblings from other retailers that employee costs could rise as we get into ’09 as we do get some wage inflation. Do you guys have a thought on that?
David B. Dillon: Well, the comment I would offer is really the same thing we’ve said every quarter; is that we try to approach our negotiations in a balance way. There are obviously, in individual markets depending on the contract and situation, things that our associates need us to take a look at, and we discuss those of course and try to solve for those issues. Sometimes it’s wages, sometimes it’s healthcare but there are legitimate things that need to be reviewed there.  On the other side, in order for our strategy to be successful, I think the union sees this and understands that we have to be able to balance our overall cost because our whole strategy is to reinvest where we have savings into things that actually matter and are important to the customer. That’s what’s driven our sales. That’s what ends up with the business model working.  So it’s striking that balance and it’s really a market-by-market situation and I don’t think today’s economic climate makes that any different than it has before. We’ve got to look at it one place at a time, one contract at a time.  Rodney described the contracts that we have before us still and of course the settlement that was just reached yesterday in Nashville. We’ve been particularly pleased at the pattern and discussions and the active dialog that we’ve had with our union partners. 
W. Rodney McMullen: We work real hard with our union partners. We understand that the associates, their need for good wages and a very affordable healthcare plan and we work very hard to accomplish that in each market we operate in. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Okay. And then I guess I was a little bit surprised by the change in lower in the LIFO down, given DOW just raised its prices today 25%. And I hear you on dairy but it just seems to me you would want to be pretty cautious as we are starting to see people put in huge price increases. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts, a little bit more thoughts on why you would actually lower it this early. 
J. Michael Schlotman: It’s actually a little bit of the inverse of why we raised it every quarter last year. We have a pretty firm methodology of how we estimate our annual LIFO charge and when we look at that calculation, this year’s first quarter and try to project out where the various categories and commodities are going to wind up by the end of the year, which is what we try to do, it indicated to us at the end of this first quarter that overall we will have a lower LIFO charge than we originally expected.  I understand what you are saying -- why not be cautious and keep it a little higher right now? It’s primarily because the accounting approach and the methodology we’ve picked estimated on a quarterly basis. We don’t go about changing that every quarter based on where a particular quarter comes in or what our needs are. We do it consistently every quarter and that’s the result it gave us at the end of the first quarter. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And as we mentioned on the call, it’s driven by expected dairy -- 
J. Michael Schlotman: Dairy is a huge drive of what our ultimate LIFO charge winds up being and right now it looks like dairy is going to come in nicely lower at the end of this year than it was at the end of last year. And keep in mind the LIFO calculation is a point in time calculation done in the fourth quarter and all we are trying to do is to estimate what that point in time is then. It’s not an accumulation of inflation during the year -- it’s actually inflation at that one point in time in the fourth quarter. 
David B. Dillon: Scott, one way I like to think about LIFO too is in addition to the point, one point time is it’s a reflection of the inventory mix we hold, not a reflection of the actual inflation we’ve experienced in the sales. They are two different mix calculations and so you have to really understand it to understand how it can happen, but that’s why dairy can drive it so strongly.  You had a follow-up?
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: How much is dairy?
J. Michael Schlotman: I’m not going to get into the specific components of the LIFO charge, but just the fact that as fast as milk moves in our stores and the fact that we produce most of the milk, so we own it not only at the store level, we own it at the diary and manufacturing level as well. We have a lot of dairy inventory so when those prices move, it can change the LIFO calculation. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Great. And just one quick one -- did I understand you guys right that you said the rebate had no sales effect?
J. Michael Schlotman: We said it had no material effect on sales or earnings for the quarter and keep in mind that for the quarter, the program was out there for three weeks and if you looked at sales trends and profit trends before and after the launch of that program, you see nothing material that happened during the quarter. And our trends, as Rodney said in the prepared comments, for the first four weeks of the second quarter continued at the high end of our guidance for the year. 
David B. Dillon: Remember the way those cards work is you don’t record any sales at all until the cards are actually used, as it is being used. So that’s why -- 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: So it is potential that we could see a lag here because it was three weeks and it could be $1330, so we could see a lag effect, so you really won’t know if it’s having a major effect until you can get through the second quarter. Is that a good way to look at it?
J. Michael Schlotman: Keep in mind the $120 in that $1320 never gets reflected as a sale. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Right.
David B. Dillon: That’s one of the things we were trying to illustrate on the prepared remarks, is if you look at for the quarter, it really didn’t have much of an effect. When you look at it overall, it’s still too early to really be able to give you insight, other than what we are seeing, we’re pleased with overall. 
Scott Muschkin - Jefferies & Company: Okay, guys, great. Thanks for answering my questions. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Karen Short of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Thanks for taking my call. Great quarter. A couple of questions actually just on food stamps; I guess are you guys seeing an increase in food stamps? And I guess how do you think about that from a positive/negative standpoint? And then is there any geographic focus if you are seeing an increase?
David B. Dillon: The answer is we’re looking around and don’t know the answer. I think we have looked at that but I don’t have a specific answer for you on that today. 
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay. And then on Ralphs, you know, there were some press releases or things that hit the trade journals on your strategy, on changes in your strategy at Ralphs. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit?
David B. Dillon: I don’t really plan to elaborate more on Ralphs strategy other than what they would describe to their customers, except to say this -- that we are pleased with the strategy they have developed as a management team. We are real focused on improving results in California, in Southern California. It’s a terrific market, both for us and the potential is also there strongly for both Ralphs and for Food For Less, and they are meaningful players in our organization.  So I would really just offer our support for what they are doing in strategy but would not add any elaboration to it. 
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay. And then on private label, I guess obviously you’ve talked a lot about inflation. How do you think about maintaining gross profit dollars versus margins with what we are seeing in private label? I mean, obviously there’s some benefit to you guys from consumers trading into private label, but I would assume you are also seeing some cost pressures from your own, from manufacturing on your side. 
David B. Dillon: Rodney pointed out that we are seeing some inflation, of course, cost pressures in our own Kroger brand and that was one of the reasons that the dollars were up on the numbers he gave. But we are -- we look at this from the point of view of the profit that we make on Kroger brand is typically a higher percentage than national brand and frankly even a higher penny’s profit when you add into it the profit that is produced in our manufacturing plants. That’s a very important point not to forget because that’s what actually makes well over half of our private label sales, are products that we produce in our plans. So on the whole, that actually works pretty well for us.  And our pricing strategy, we typically look at the relationship of what customers buy and what price they buy and how much below a national brand you want to be targeted in order to get those sales. We also recognize occasionally we’ll make a little less profit on a private label because it will help the overall picture of what Kroger brand can do. The more customers we convert to more Kroger brand, the better off we are and the better we like it. 
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, and I guess just a last question -- I mean, there was a little bit of noise that you might have, prior to your earnings release, that you might have been seeing some weakness on general merchandise sales at Marketplace and Fred Meyer stores. Do you have any comments on what you are seeing in general merchandise?
David B. Dillon: Sure. There are actually two major product categories we are seeing noticeable weakness. We’ve commented on these before. One is in general merchandise and the other is in jewelry. If Rodney wants to add anything on jewelry, that area reports up to him and he may want to do that but in general merchandise, we are seeing some weakness there, not just at Fred Meyer. Fred Meyer of course has more general merchandise than other places but it would show up there, but it’s also showing up in other stores as well and it’s showing up in our seasonal merchandise sales, you know, patio sets and things like that in the summer.  But it’s driven by a couple of things, particularly the seasonal. It’s driven not only by the economy and a lower amount of spendable income, we think, but it’s also driven by weather. Weather has been noticeably different this year in many parts of the country -- cooler, and by being cooler people were not inclined to go out and buy a patio set for the summer, as an example. And then you get deep enough into the summer and they say well, we’ll wait until next year.  We of course track every day, every week where our sales are and what our sell-through is on things like that and it’s a little less than where it was last year, but our merchants are taking close watch of that and are devising strategies to help give our customers -- already have been giving our customers some really good deals. 
W. Rodney McMullen: In terms of jewelry, if you look at for the whole company for a year it’s less than 1% of our business, so just so that everybody recognizes that. If you look at our performance in the quarter, it would be very similar to the other public jewelry companies if you look at Signet and some of the other ones. Obviously a negative identicals. If you look at in the last few weeks, the trends have been a little bit better than what they were early in the quarter and what they were in the fourth quarter last year. So we are seeing some improvement. How much of that is a tax rebate check and how much of it is trend changes, that’s too early to say. 
Karen Short - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk, I think you have said that you haven’t seen price wars in a really long time and I just want to confirm that you are not really seeing any significant change in the competitive environment with this slowing economy. 
David B. Dillon: Well, I tend to define a price war as more irrational pricing behavior and I have not seen that sort of thing in our industry in a long time. We occasionally see some tiny erratic changes in individual markets and there’s always something like that going on but nothing that would be noteworthy.  I think the industry is quite rational. I think the industry recognizes, as we recognize, that you need to get a return on your assets and I just think that’s been the picture of this kind of industry for actually 10 or 20 years. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: And when you look at -- you guys don’t usually talk much about the boost to the total volume or units that comes from making acquisitions, but you did do a couple last year and I was just wondering, it would be great actually if we kind of had that on a regular basis. Maybe it’s not significant but what the outlook is for more of those kinds of local acquisitions that’s highly accretive, I think. 
David B. Dillon: We like those a lot. Rodney, do you want to -- 
W. Rodney McMullen: Yeah, I was just going to say we always like end-market acquisitions for us. It seems to work very well and we are always on the outlook of it. We want to make sure we don’t build our business model around where we have to do those in order to make our numbers work and that’s one of the reasons why you don’t hear us talking about it, except when we actually do something. But anytime something becomes available, we will take a look at it. We think it’s important to make sure that we pay a fair price for the seller and for us as the buyer and that’s what we are always looking at, something that ties in and works for us, and we’ve been very pleased.  And the two that you talked about that we did last year, both of those are working very well and our store teams have just done a great job of integrating it into Kroger and providing something additional for the customers. 
David B. Dillon: Also keep in mind the new stores haven’t been around long enough to be in our identical sales calculation yet. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And would you say that this environment makes it more likely that you will see opportunities or not really any change?
W. Rodney McMullen: There’s no shortage of things that we see. There’s still a gap in valuation and we see -- we are seeing -- probably right now we see a little bit more things where people put stuff on the market and then nothing actually happens. I assume that means they weren’t satisfied with the price but I don’t know that for sure. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then another comment or question really is you haven’t commented at all about the flooding in the Midwest. I guess you -- presumably you’ve got that baked in somehow into your outlook for inflation. Did it have any impact on your business itself? I’m not sure where the flooding compares to where your stores are completely but is that something that is going on right now?
David B. Dillon: Well, we’ve had some disruption but it’s not been significant or material. Do you want to comment on any specifics?
J. Michael Schlotman: We had a couple of stores, a C store in Iowa, a grocery store in Indiana and a C store in Indiana that were affected by floods, and all of those -- the cost of any of that is reflected in our results already. 
David B. Dillon: I would add to that -- we also had a few stores that had major power outages because of storms and things like that. And I want to add, even though it’s not maybe relevant, Meredith, to what you are asking but it is relevant to anyone else listening on the call, the employees and the management teams and all the employees associated with those geographic areas when that happens have to absolutely work their fannies off and they really do a wonderful job. And this last series of storms was a really good illustration of that. They recovered quickly, got back open quickly in nearly every case, minimized the damage and helped our customers because customers in times like that really need our services more than almost any other time. So trying to get us back into position like that is a huge thing to do.  So I don’t want to reduce the impact of that by saying the financial impact is not going to be important here but the contribution that our associates make is significant. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Those are my questions. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question will be from the line of Neil Currie of UBS. 
Doug Cooper - UBS: This is Doug Cooper in for Neil Currie. I have a couple of questions here. The first question is can you quantify or tell us a little bit more about where you are gaining the share from? Wal-Mart had made comments to the point that higher incomes were now shopping, higher household incomes were now shopping in their store. Can you quantify a little bit more about where that share gain is coming from?
David B. Dillon: Doug, we’ve said before that we’re getting it from lots of different places. At the end of the year, I guess last quarter, we released our market share data and when we released that, we illustrated that based on our estimates that Wal-Mart’s market share actually is growing in the markets where we are growing too. So it’s obviously coming from other areas especially and some of it obviously is restaurants. Some of it is from other outlets that would not be classified as groceries, you know, local independents and things would not be under that heading. But then of course, then you do have the local independents and some of the regional chains that may have given up some market share too. But it’s all of those things, and our focus at Kroger is not so much on individual competitors as it is on our customer. And if we draw from our customers’ needs and fill their needs, we’ll get the business from wherever they were previously going, whether it’s a supermarket or some other form of business. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And if you look at the stuff that we work with dunnhumby on, we actually see the gains really in all types of customers. It’s not just lower income or higher income. It’s really all customers. 
Doug Cooper - UBS: Great. Now in terms of your Ralphs price cuts that you announced recently in the L.A. Times, I guess there was an article but can you quantify a little bit about how you are approaching those price cuts?
David B. Dillon: No, we are not going to talk about individual markets today. 
Doug Cooper - UBS: Okay. In terms of -- you say moderate for inflation. You know, we’ve noticed year over year comparisons are higher for most categories. Is that compared to absolute, relative pricing? What can you say about absolute pricing?
David B. Dillon: I’m not sure I understand the question exactly but we characterized it as moderate inflation primarily because lots been written about it and if you read the press, you would think that inflation and food products was like off the charts.  One of the reasons for that is we’ve had a 20-year period of time where we’ve had basically no inflation, zero. You know, half a point up, half a point down, but really zero. So now that we’ve had a year or two now of low level and moderate inflation, people are writing a lot about it and seeing it. So that’s why we wanted to make sure we characterized it as moderate. Do you want to add anything?
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, and there are some areas where there’s deflation. And if you look at pharmacy as an example, you know, there’s significant deflation in pharmacy. So what gets the headline are the things you have inflation in but when you look at the business overall, we are seeing about 3.5% inflation that we talked about before. 
Doug Cooper - UBS: And the deflation in pharmacy, is that a direct impact of the up-tick in generics?
W. Rodney McMullen: I would say that was the biggest driver of it, it’s certainly generics. Some of it is obviously our own $4 program and $10 for 90 days. 
Doug Cooper - UBS: Okay. Thank you. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Doug. I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: And that question will be from the line of Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. You had mentioned that you own and manufacture more of your private label products than competitors. Is it better to own your own private label in an inflationary environment or is it better to use third parties during that period?
David B. Dillon: Well, we like it for a lot of reasons, one of which is that we know exactly what the cost increases are. While you could have, if you were buying from a third party, you could have potentially some lag between when the costs actually are incurred and when you get increased costs. But if you have too much of a lag, those third party operators actually will need to push the prices up even higher yet than they need to be, so there’s a lot of put and take there in the short term.  In the long-term though, I would much prefer to be in the position of owning the assets. I think it actually works well and we can control our own destiny better. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Obviously by cutting out the third party there, you have the opportunity for either higher margin or going lower on price -- which do you lean towards with your own product?
David B. Dillon: It depends entirely on the product, how customers in our view would react, how targeted a particular item would be for them. We’re not afraid actually of either way, of getting a lower price but we’re also not afraid of getting a higher margin. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. 
David B. Dillon: If you look at our corporate brands overall, about half of those corporate brands, we would manufacture, half of it we do buy from third parties. So we have the opportunity to see both sides of it.  We love owning the plants. The other thing that by owning the plants what it allows you to do is improve the supply chain, where you can eliminate any type of wasted efforts through the supply chain and give that benefit to our customers. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay, very good. I just wanted to ask if the mix of promotional buying from your customers has changed dramatically over the last couple of quarters. 
David B. Dillon: I wouldn’t characterize it as a dramatic change, no. 
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And how about the pricing gap relative to your competitors? Have others tried to follow your lead on lowering prices?
David B. Dillon: I’m not going to comment on our competitors’ pricing strategies.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. All right. Great quarter and congratulations. 
David B. Dillon: Thank you. And for everybody listening, I want to have a few wrap-up comments here before we sign off, especially for some of our associates who we encourage to listen in on the call.  To our associates, thank you for your contributions to our strong first quarter results. Our performance is tied directly to the efforts you make every day and we appreciate your commitment to keeping our customer first in your daily decisions.  One customer summed it up well in a recent letter to me that he wrote about great service he and his family consistently enjoyed at their local Ralph store at Porter Ranch, California. He wrote that although he and his wife have more than 12 supermarkets in a 10-mile radius of their home, they shop only at Ralphs because of the amazing professionalism and courteous treatment we get from the wonderful staff you have there. From cashing in our coupons to simply saying hello or asking where something might be found, this staff is fantastic. We’ve never encountered anything but the highest level of kindness, respect, and cooperation. He went on to say about how proud I should be of the team there and indeed I am. Rick Foley and all his team members do a really great job. This is another terrific example of what does happen when a team is committed to delivering exceptional customer service.  Congratulations to each one of the great team members at our Ralph store Porter Ranch. Our results tell us that there are examples like this in every store and in every workplace throughout our whole company. As each of our paychecks reminds us, a satisfied customer made this paycheck possible. Thank you for keeping your focus on our customers, and one final note -- we hope you and your families enjoy a safe and happy summer.  Goodbye and thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes our presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Kroger Co.’s fourth quarter earnings call. My name is Grace Ann and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of today’s conference. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn our presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but further assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I would like to introduce Mr. David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Carin, and good morning, everyone. We’re pleased you could join us to review Kroger’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s vice chairman, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Don McGeorge is off today. It would seem that the flu season is indeed finally here. I’ll begin with a recap of Kroger’s fourth quarter and fiscal year sales result and then provide our latest market share information. Rodney will review our fiscal year results and provide guidance for 2008 and then we’ll be happy to take your questions. Total sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2% to $17.2 billion. After adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2006 total sales increased 10.2%. Identical supermarket sales increased 8.2% with fuel and 5.3% without fuel based on the same 12-week period in both years. Our strong identical sales growth continues to be broad based across the company’s geographic regions. The strongest departments were grocery, produce, nutrition, and bakery/deli. Net earnings in the fourth quarter totalled $322.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share. The LIFO charge in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per diluted share resulting from higher than expected inflation and was $0.02 per diluted share more than we anticipated when we reported our third quarter results to you back in December. We continue to drive solid identical sales growth by improving service, value, product quality, and selection for our customers. During the quarter we continued to invest in lower prices for our customers providing meaningful savings for them in this uncertain economic environment.  We ended the fiscal year with a strong quarter. The fourth quarter and full fiscal year highlight what Kroger’s strategy is designed to do: deliver strong financial results today while we continue to invest in the future.  Rodney will discuss our fiscal year results in a few minutes. First I’ll share our latest market share results with you. Increasing market share is a corner stone of our strategy and I am very pleased to report that for the third consecutive year Kroger has shown impressive market share gains. The market share figures we report are based on our own calculations and consider the potential for sales in each market from all retail outlets where customers can purchase products Kroger sells, including supercentres and other non-traditional retail formats such as dollar stores, drug stores, and warehouse clubs. Most third-party market share data providers only consider traditional formats.  Kroger serves customers in 44 major markets. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. In 2007 Kroger held a number one or number two market share position in 39 of our 44 major markets. Our overall market share in these 44 major markets rose approximately 65 basis points during 2007 on a volume-weighted basis. Kroger shared an increase in 37 of those 44 major markets, a decline in six, and remained unchanged in one. Kroger competes against a total of 1,340 supercentres, an increase of 78 over last year. Supercentres have achieved at least a number three market share position in 36 of our major markets. Kroger’s overall market share in these 36 markets rose 95 basis points during 2007 on a volume-weighted basis. Our share increased in 31 of those 36 major markets, declined in four, and remained unchanged in one. Of the 1,340 supercentres that I mentioned 1,065 are operated by Wal-Mart. This is an increase of 65 over last year. That increase is the lowest in seven or eight years. Wal-Mart supercentres have achieved at least a number three share position in 34 of the major markets where Kroger faces significant supercentre competition compared with 32 last year. Kroger’s overall market share in these 34 markets rose over 80 basis points in 2007. Our share increased in 30 of the 34 major markets, declined in three, and remained unchanged in one.  Despite the growing number of competitors in the grocery business we have increased our market share on top of strong gains in 2005 and 2006. During the last three fiscal years combined, Kroger’s share in our major markets has increased approximately 165 basis points. These consecutive year-over-year gains in market share are significant because they show that Kroger’s long-term strategy is working as we continue to deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank our associates for their direct impact on increasing Kroger’s market share in so many of the markets we serve. They see first hand what happens when new competition enters one of our markets and they understand what it takes to distinguish Kroger from the rest in the eyes of our customers.  While these latest market share numbers are impressive, we know there is more opportunity out there for our company. Even with Kroger’s strong share in our 44 major markets, approximately 46% of the share in those markets continues to be held by competitors without our autonomies of scale. We estimate that their share as declined nearly 4% over the last four years. Now I’d like to turn it to Rodney, who will review our fiscal year and discuss our guidance for 2008. Rodney?
W. Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong results thanks to the contributions of our associates in every area of our business. Our associates continue to execute our customer first plan well as we continue to balance operating cost reductions with investments aimed at improving our customers’ shopping experience. As Dave said, Kroger had a great year. For the full 2007 fiscal year total sales increased 6.2% to $70.2 billion. Adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 8.2%. Identical supermarket sales increased 6.9% with fuel and 5.3% without fuel based on the same 52-week period in both years. We delivered on a fiscal 2007 objectives we outlined for investors a year ago. Our original target for identical supermarket sales growth for the year, excluding fuel sales, was 3% to 5%. We raised the lower end of that range to 3.5% after the first quarter and raised it again to 4% after the second quarter.  At the end of the third quarter we said we expected identical supermarket sales growth of 5% for the full year excluding fuel sales. Today we reported full-year identical supermarket sales growth without fuel of 5.3%, exceeding all of our expectations throughout the year. On a two-year stacked basis, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter that we’ve reported identical supermarket sales excluding fuel of 10% or higher.  Kroger’s strong identical sales growth in 2007 was a key driver of our earnings-per-share growth, which is consistent with our business model. We originally expected to deliver earnings per share growth of $1.60 to $1.65 per diluted share for fiscal 2007. Today we reported earnings of $1.69 per diluted share. This equates to a 15% growth after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006. This growth, plus Kroger’s dividend yield of slightly more than 1%, created strong value for our shareholders. I want to note that we exceeded our original fiscal 2007 earnings guidance despite a pre-tax LIFO charge that was $104 million higher than our original expectations for the year. The higher than expected LIFO charge is a reflection of the current inflationary environment.  Like many food retailers, we continue to experience product cost inflation across many core grocery and perishable categories at levels not seen in several years. We estimate that our product cost inflation during the fourth quarter versus last year was 3.8% excluding fuel.  While the LIFO charge is a non-cash expense that negatively impacts Kroger’s operating margins and reduces earnings, it does create cash tax savings for the company. The impact of the higher LIFO charge on our fiscal 2007 earnings was mostly offset by higher than expected sales.  Let me turn now to some other highlights of our fiscal 2007 results. Our operating margin, excluding fuel, declined 3 basis points from a year ago. Excluding the impact of the higher than expected LIFO charge, Kroger’s operating margin expanded 14 basis points for the year, which is consistent with our strategy. The 14 basis point expansion is the result of a 19 basis point decline in Kroger’s non-fuel FIFO gross margin and a 33 basis point improvement in our non-fuel OG&A rate for fiscal 2007 in comparison to the prior year. Kroger’s FIFO gross margin declined on non-fuel sales primarily reflects our strategy of continued investments and lower prices for our customers.  Our supermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 20 basis points on an annual basis, which was consistent with the fourth quarter decline of 18 basis points.  The improvement in our OG&A rate is due to our strong identical sales leverage, increased productivity, and progress we have made in controlling our utility, health care, and pension expenses. These improvements continue to be offset by higher credit card fees.  Rent and depreciation expense as a result of non-fuel sales were comparable to last year. However, it’s important to note that fiscal 2006 contained 53 weeks of sales and only 52 weeks of depreciation expense due to the structure of our fiscal calendar. Fiscal 2007 contained 52 weeks of sales and 52 weeks of depreciation expense. Now I’d like to spend a little bit of time talking about capital investment. At the beginning of fiscal 2007 we plan to invest approximately $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in capital projects during the year, excluding acquisitions. Our actual capital investments for 2007 were $2.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, compared with $1.8 billion in fiscal 2006.  We completed 200 store remodels during the year and opened, expanded, relocated, or acquired 102 supermarkets. In 2006 we remodelled 158 stores and opened, expanded, relocated, or acquired 53 locations.  Another important element of our capital investment plan is our logistics network, a vital link between our stores and our customers. Over the last three years we have invested more than $400 million in our logistics network making it more efficient and an industry leader in many areas. These investments have covered a wide range of projects including transitioning three warehouses to automated systems and beginning installations of the same technology in others. Our investments in logistics are generating an excellent return. Total debt at year-end 2007 was $8.1 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from a year ago. On a rolling four-quarter basis Kroger’s net total debt to EBIDTA ratio was 2.0 compared to 1.9 during the same period last year. We expect to manage the use of our free cash flow to maintain a leverage ratio that supports our investment rate rating. Also during the year, Kroger repurchased 52.5 million shares of stock at an average price of $27.05 for a total investment of $1.4 billion. Over the past four quarters Kroger has returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. At the current share price we expect the $941 million remaining under our current authorization to be sufficient to fund repurchases throughout fiscal year 2008.  Since January 2000 Kroger has reduced its net total debt to EBIDTA ratio from 2.8 to 2.0, a reduction of 0.8 times EBIDTA. During the same time frame Kroger has invested $5 billion to repurchase 237.3 million shares of stock at an average price of $21.22 per share. The company has also paid $341.5 million in cash dividends to shareholders since it initiated its dividend program in 2006. In 2007 our board approved a dividend increase from $0.06.5 to $0.07.5 per share, reflecting its confidence in Kroger’s strategic plan.  Kroger performed well in 2007. We delivered on the objectives we established at the beginning of the year and we improved our position relative to our major competitors in the four key areas of our customer first plan: our people, our products, our prices, and the overall shopping experience for our customers. We continue to deliver results today while making investments for our future. These investments include lower prices and better service for our customers, a wide array of products that align with the changing needs of our customers, a strong commitment to investing capital in our store base, our store remodels are producing results above our expectations, and the return on investment in our new stores continue to improve, and a share repurchase program that continues to demonstrate the confidence in Kroger’s future.  Our strategic plan continues to serve customers, associates, and shareholders well and we believe it will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2008.  Now I’d like to turn to our expectations for fiscal 2008. As Dave mentioned, we expect that our strategy will work even as economic and competitive landscapes continue to evolve. For fiscal 2008 Kroger anticipates earnings of $1.83 to $1.90 per diluted share. As in 2007, we anticipate Kroger’s earnings per share growth will be drive by strong identical sales, a slight improvement in non-fuel operating margins, and fewer shares outstanding.  Identical supermarket sales growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% excluding fuel sales. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by Kroger’s dividend. The range for identical sales and earnings guidance takes into account the current uncertainty about future economic conditions. The upper end of the range assumes current economic conditions will continue while the lower end assumes economic conditions weakened slightly. Our annual earnings guidance assumes fuel margins similar to fiscal 2007. As you know, due to the nature of the fuel business, there could be volatility from quarter to quarter as we saw last year. Our earnings per share growth in sales guidance is based on a stable labour environment. This year we have labour negotiation covering store associates in Columbus, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Louisville, Nashville, Phoenix, and Portland. In every negotiation we work to achieve a competitive cost structure in each market while meeting our associate’s needs for good wages and affordable health care.  While we do not give specific quarterly guidance, I do want to note that we anticipate earnings per share growth in the first and fourth quarter of 2008 will be higher than the annual growth rate and that the third quarter will be lower than the annual growth rate. This is important to remember when calculating your 2008 quarterly estimates. We filed an 8K earlier today that outlines some of our additional expectations for fiscal 2008. One other point before I turn it back over to Dave, although it’s still early in the year and so far in the first quarter our identical supermarket sales trends are tracking at the high end of our identical sales guidance range, there are signs that there are some discretionary spending decreasing, but our business model is well suited for this environment. Now I’d like to turn it over to Dave for some closing remarks. Dave?
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. I am very pleased with Kroger’s performance during the fourth quarter and full year. We did better than we said we would and our results clearly indicate that.  Our results highlight Kroger’s ability to consistently deliver results in the near term and at the same time make meaningful investments in the future.  This year Kroger is honoured to celebrate our 125th anniversary. Our longevity is our testament to our ability to change along with our customers. We’ve been fortunate as a company to welcome change decade after decade and to use it to benefit our customers, associates, and shareholders.  The success we have enjoyed along the way is a tribute to the hundreds of thousands of associates who work hard to set Kroger apart from the rest. And while I have additional comments for our associates listening in today after we answer your questions, I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire Kroger team. Every store, every division, every banner, every plant, every distribution centre, every office, and every operations centre, for a terrific year. Our growth has taken many forms over the years, but there is one constant that has never changed: the commitment of our associates to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. We’ll now take a few minutes for your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Please stand by for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: A few things. I want to drill down on inflation a little bit and how that might change the way you look at the business. For example, if you look at wage rate pressure, does there come a point here, I don’t know if it’s this year or next year or beyond, when you start to get some pressure on labour costs because of contractually higher wage rate increases? That’s one thing. And then secondly, in terms of how you buy product. When we had inflation in the past we saw a lot of forward-buying activity. Do you think we see that again or do you think we see an increase in consignment to kind of keep working capital under better control?
David B. Dillon: Well, good morning, John. On the wage question, actually, wages are a product of every individual market and that market’s conditions. Every contract would be different as to what contractual obligations there would be on wages. Of course, there’s always some pressure on wages, but actually the issue over the last several contracts in many markets has been we’ve had to find a way to reduce the ongoing cost of pension and some of the health care costs that were built into the contracts in order to afford the higher wages that actually the company even wanted to pay. So I don’t see the wage picture particularly changing with this inflationary environment, even though the inflation we described at 3.8% is higher than what we’ve seen for many years. It is still what I would characterize as still moderate in long traditional terms. As for forward buy, I think we already saw some increases in forward buy in the year and certainly in the quarter. It’s one, it’s not the biggest reason, but it’s one of the reasons that our inventories are higher on the balance sheet because we’re fairly deliberate about it as we see costs go up of making sure we have made a conscious choice of how to buy products best to reduce the cost for our customers, therefore reducing the retail price for the customer.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Secondly, and I’ve always asked you guys about price elasticity of pricing investments. It would seem in this market being the price of elasticity is higher and indeed get more bang for your buck by investing more, how do you look at that as a balance? Do you see the same level of investment as a year ago? You know, eight or some different amount?
David B. Dillon: Well, the customers do notice on some products as inflation draws the price out. Milk was the best example last year. And we have talked about it all year long where a tonnage or gallonage in milk actually suffered because of the inflated price. We remain competitive and, in fact, a couple of times during the year we were actually more competitive than what the costs would have ordinarily provided. But generally speaking, we have been able to pass through cost increases as we receive them and that’s our objective and that has been successfully done. For the most part, you’ve heard a lot of the national brand vendors talk about their volume, their tonnage does not seem to have been impacted by that. I don’t know that I can speak specific to any of them, but I can say that our tonnage has been strong this year and even when you take inflation into account our identical sales were strong. We were very pleased with the year’s outcome. So you may be right a little bit on the price elasticity as it changes, as some costs go up, but I think it depends entirely on what the items are and how much they go up and I think we’re very conscious of what our customers see in pricing. So our investment in pricing is going to be based on what we think the customers want, what we think we can afford based on our cost structure, and what we think will produce sustainable results. I think that’s important. We’re trying not to put money into promotional practices that are not sustainable. We’re trying to do things that we can do for a very long period of time and that will sustain our sales for a very long period of time. 
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: And then finally, your guidance and corporates, what LIFO charge? 
J. Michael Schlotman: Similar to this year, John.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: About 155-ish? 
J. Michael Schlotman: Yes.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks.
W. Rodney McMullen: One other thing, John. Dave mentioned it a little bit. But in terms of what we would invest in pricing will also be driven by what we take in on costs for OG&A and we’ve said overall we expect a slightly improving operating margin and we would expect that would continue this year as it has been in the past for a strategy.
John Heinbockel – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of Friedman, Billings and Ramsey.
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Hey there. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to ask, you know, there’s been a lot of discussion about generics in general and I’m wondering if you could give some colour on what maybe the negative impact of generics on your identical store sales and on the flip side the positive impact on gross margins? And then I’ll just follow up.
David B. Dillon: Karen, when you’re referring to generics are you referring to corporate brands? Our own brand?
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Oh, sorry. I meant on pharmacy.
David B. Dillon: Oh, on pharmacy. In pharmacy we have, of course, tracked the change from the patented prescriptions to the generic prescriptions as everyone else has. I think we would characterize that shift for us in the same ball park as what you’ve heard from other retailers in the same sector. It’s not much different than what they’ve described.
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Okay. And then the benefit on the gross margin.
David B. Dillon: I don’t know whether we have said anything on that.
W. Rodney McMullen: When you look at pharmacy by itself you can clearly see the improvement in margin, but by the time you look at the total company results it gets pretty blended when you look at it across all departments.
J. Michael Schlotman: It would help percent, the dollars would be a little different because the dollars on the sale are so much lower, but the percent on a generic item like that is much higher.
W. Rodney McMullen: By the time you look at total Kroger it really doesn’t have much of an influence relative to that.
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Okay. Great. And then just thinking about leap year, the extra day in this quarter, I guess the first question is what would be the impact of that on your comp? Would your ID be tracking at the high end of the range of guidance if we exclude the benefit of the extra day? 
David B. Dillon: Karen, actually there is no extra benefit of an extra day for us. The way the calendar works for us, every few years we have a 53rd week as we did last, not last year, but in ’06. The reason we do that is to actually adjust for that leap day every few years. So we have the exact same number of days and weeks in our totals for the first quarter of ’08 as we would have had last year. More importantly, as we give identical sales we always make sure that there are a comparable number of days and weeks and we adjust for those kinds of things.
W. Rodney McMullen: Our 52-week years have 364 days and the 53rd week year to catch up to the calendar versus our fiscal calendar, they’ll have seven more days.
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Okay. Great. And then do you have any comments on what you’re seeing in the acquisition landscape?
David B. Dillon: It would be very similar to what we’ve said for the last several years. Continue to see quite a bit of availability. Pricing expectations really aren’t consistent with what we think the economics work as a general rule. As you know, though, last year we were able to acquire almost 40 stores in a couple of different markets. but we continue to look at several opportunities and at the right price we’ll deal with it. 
Karen Short – Friedman, Billings, Ramsey and Company: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of FTN Midwest.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: Good morning, everyone. Just to check on one thing, you have wild food purchases last weekend a head of the snowstorms in Cincinnati.
David B. Dillon: That would be true, yes.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: I just want to make sure the customers respond as usual. Dave, could you talk about the whole prepared foods category last year? How you thought it progressed and especially what kind of trends you saw in the fourth quarter.
David B. Dillon: Chuck, before we turn to that I want to go back to your first comment about the snowstorm. We did have a snowstorm across this part of the country and, yes, it does give us a good strong sales boost for those couple of days. You would expect, in fact, if you went in right after the snowstorm you would see some holes in place of soup and milk and some places like that. I was in stores on Sunday, which was the day after that, and we had recovered actually pretty well. So I want to tip my hat to both the store associates and the division associates and all of our logistics people and the manufacturing people who just did a remarkable job of making sure we had product to sell during that time. So it’s a tricky time. Now to your specific question. Prepared foods, those are developing both at Kroger and I think generally within the US. I would go to say it’s a rapid pace. It’s probably a rapid percentage, but it’s still a pretty low base. As a result it’s not going to be meaningful in anything that you’re going to see in overall data for a while. But yes, it is clearly increasing, both for us and across a number of our competitors.
W. Rodney McMullen: And as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, deli/bakery is one of the departments that had very strong sales growth and a lot of that is driven by prepared foods. It’s not just new prepared food items, some of it is existing items too. 
David B. Dillon: In fact, I’m speculating here, but I believe that the sales growth is more by the existing items even than the new prepared items.
W. Rodney McMullen: Certainly on a dollar basis.
David B. Dillon: Yeah. On a dollar basis. Percent wise what I said before is right.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: Do you think that reflects quality improvements in the traditional items or the price of gas or what’s affecting that? 
David B. Dillon: I think it’s improved on the traditional items for us and the reason our deli/bakery sales are up is we have improved our quality, improved our price position, improved the offering. All of that I think contributes to that. Certainly our sales overall are at least modestly helped by what’s happening with gas, as we have discussed before. That is a slight positive for us. 
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: Dave, can you talk about, and Rodney as well, looking at your choice between stock repurchase and improving the yield on the stock with the dividend. What would you thinking about their going forward.
David B. Dillon: Rodney or Mike, do you want to comment on that?
W. Rodney McMullen: If you look on the stock repurchasing dividend we continue to be slightly biased to stock repurchase, obviously. If you look at last year that’s what we actually did. At current stock prices that would certainly be our bias.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: Okay. And then last thing, Dave, could you give us some colour on what you saw in the changes in spending among discretionary categories?
David B. Dillon: Well, overall I’m assuming you’re wanting to get a sense of how the consumer’s behaving in this environment.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: Yes.
David B. Dillon: At Kroger we really do not see clear signs of the customer pulling back. We do see improved sales in Kroger brand, but we’ve been seeing improved sales in Kroger brand for a number of years now. So it’s not just the result of the economy. It’s also the result of what we’ve done in improved packaging and in quality on Kroger brand. We have seen some declines in selected categories, but they are the obvious categories that you’ve heard elsewhere. Jewellery, as an example. Selected non-food areas like domestics and home furnishings are other examples. But one of the reasons that Rodney made the comment he did about where we are so far in ’08 was to help you see what we’re seeing in today’s economy. Just to refresh your memory, what Rodney said is the identical sales trend so far in 2008 is tracking at the high end of the sales range that we gave for guidance so far.  We think Kroger’s well positioned as a value proposition and better positioned than even in the past. Our strategy, our pricing approach, the work our associates do really positions us well to weather in this economy, in our opinion. So yeah, we’re maybe seeing some changes as I’ve described in these few categories, but there are really no clear signs of the customer pulling back at Kroger.
Chuck Cerankosky – FTN Midwest Securities: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Banc of America.
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: Hi. This is actually Bakud Sonan (sp) for Scott here. I just wanted to touch on in terms of food inflation. At what point do you, you know, you’re 3.8 for the quarter. At what point do you start to get concerned about that input inflation. What number would we kind of look for as far as becoming less orderly in your minds?
David B. Dillon: Well, the 3.8% is an annualized number first. I want to make sure that you have that in mind. I characterized it as moderate inflation and I genuinely feel that it is moderate. I don’t think I want to speculate on how high ends up being trouble. You could get to a high enough level I suppose that it could be disruptive in the economy in ways that creates other issues for us. But generally speaking, particularly moderate inflation like we’re seeing, is a net-net positive for us. As I mentioned, we’ve been successful in passing along the costs this past year.  I will tell you also that in ’08 we’re seeing so far in ’08 pretty much what we saw last quarter. A continuation of that same trend. It’s not much higher, not much lower. It’s basically the same picture.
W. Rodney McMullen: You’ve heard us say it many times before on inflation, but that’s one of the things about having such a wonderful corporate brand program that we have. At any point in time if CPG companies would pass in prices on more than what the actual inflation is we have our corporate brand product that’s excellent product that customers will routinely switch over. And you can see whenever a CPG company raises prices more than what the economics makes sense, corporate brand always picks up share in a reasonably quick period of time. 
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: In terms of traffic versus, I know you guys don’t give this, but traffic versus ticket. Are you seeing reasonably stable trends there? What’s it look like there?
David B. Dillon: Both the traffic and the ticket increased and if you were to try to inflation adjust the average sale that would give a little stronger emphasis on the traffic than on the average sale. But they’ve both improved.
W. Rodney McMullen: And I was just going to say it’s very consistent with what we’ve seen for the last three or four quarters. 
David B. Dillon: Yeah, not much difference.
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: Okay. Nice quarter, guys. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Whitmer of Cleveland Research Company.
Jason Whitmer – Cleveland Research Company: Hi, good morning. Dave, can you talk a little bit about the slowdown in square footage growth you’re seeing from some of the non-traditional outlets? It seems like there’s been this continuing trend of rationalization consolidation within the grocery channel, but this seems to be a little bit more of a newer phenomenon where other good retailers may be slowing it down a bit. Is that something that is starting to have an impact within some of your markets or what would you expect over the next couple years in how that, how Kroger can respond in that sort of environment?
David B. Dillon: Well, the example that I gave in the earlier comments was last year we had 65 Wal-Mart supercentres opening up against us in the major markets. that’s the lowest number of new Wal-Mart supercentres we’ve had in seven or eight years. That’s significant in one sense, but in the other hand that’s still a very large number of stores. In our view Wal-Mart is still doing very well in groceries. That’s actually, you see that in our sales trends when they talk about it. I think every traditional and non-traditional retailer like we do makes their own rational choices as to where they think they get the advantages and what works for them and what doesn’t. I just simply read into the Wal-Mart statement that they maybe felt they were cannibalizing too much on their own sales and so they were going to slow it down a bit. But that slowdown still looks like 65 last year, which is a big number.
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: And is your step up in square footage, it looks modest, but noticeable, up to 2%, 2.5% for next year. Is that going to be pretty broad based or do you have certain geographic markers and certain formats in mind for that?
David B. Dillon: Well, we’re targeting a number of things, but as you know we’re bullish on what we’ve done with our marketplace store. So that’s important. We still continue to emphasize remodels. Even though that doesn’t increase square footage we think it connects well with the customer, particular with what we’ve been doing. Rodney or Mike, do you want to add?
W. Rodney McMullen: And we continue to focus on expansions. The increase in square footage would primarily driven by additional marketplace stores versus the base. Not so much additional number of stores. 
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: Okay. And then lastly, you talked briefly about the market acquisition you did in ’07 and some of the availability of opportunity going forward. But what’s been the impact so far of those? It obviously doesn’t move the needle for the entire company a whole lot, but as far as the return on that investment and with some of the in-market impact, especially as things continue to rationalize in some of those key markets for you.
David B. Dillon: The two that we did we’re very pleased with the results of both of those and where they are tracking. We’re starting now to focus on the remodelling of those stores and that’s when it really becomes special for our customers and associates. 
Bakud Sonan – Banc of America: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Hi, everybody. I’d like to start with, 18 months ago when you had an analyst meeting you gave us a slide that looked at customer perception of areas that were important to you. Pricing was one of them and service and I forget exactly what all the others were. I think there were four of them in total. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what customer research says now about all those things beyond price because I think we know your pricing image has gotten better.
David B. Dillon: If you look, the other three that we talked about was people, shopping experience, and products. On all three of those we continue to make progress relative to our traditional and non-traditional competitors. If you ask us internally, we would tell you we’re not making as much progress as we would like to be, but if you look at where we are, we are making progress. On all three of them. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Great. Wonderful. And then another question I’d like to ask is, we’ve been talking a little bit about Wal-Mart. First, do you believe that you are taking share back from Wal-Mart in any of these markets? I mean, it sounds like your share went up in markets where you compete with them. And then I have another question about Wal-Mart.
David B. Dillon: Meredith, our market share in the markets where Wal-Mart has gained a one, two or three share for the last several years has increased and my view, my personal view of where we’ve gained that share and the way in which we’ve looked at it is the same as it was last year and the year before that. That is that what’s happening in those markets is that we’re gaining at Kroger, Wal-Mart continues to gain in share – sometimes that’s because they’ve added new stores, but Wal-Mart does continue to gain in share – and that both Wal-Mart and Kroger are taking that share from other sources. Other places that people are shopping. I think that is not true every place, but that’s true in the bulk of the situations. So I think the answer is no, I don’t really see us as taking a share from Wal-Mart, I see us taking it from the other traditional and some other non-traditional grocers that are out there. If you look at the traditional companies that track these sorts of things, and we look at AC Nielsen, for instance. What we see there is remaining, what they call remaining food, which would exclude us and exclude Wal-Mart. That continues to decline year after year. I think that’s mostly where it’s coming from.
W. Rodney McMullen: An awful lot would be from people without our economies of scale. And as you know the way we define markets there’s still well over 40% market held by people without our economies of scale. 
David B. Dillon: The number I used was 46 and we said that that’s declined, the share for that group has declined about four percentage points in roughly four years, so about a percent a year.
J. Michael Schlotman: The other thing, Meredith, is last year there were 32 major markets where Wal-Mart was at least third of our major markets at and this year that increased by two to 34. So just that statistic would lead you to believe that they continue to either grow sales in their existing boxes and/or build new boxes to move up into more markets like that to at least a number three position.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then we talk about 65 new Wal-Mart stores. Would you say that the majority of those are in markets where they are not yet fully established? Fully west, Ohio, those areas. 
David B. Dillon: Actually, I don’t know the answer to that. Sixty-five is a lot of stores and so there are a lot of places. They’ve certainly opened a lot of stores around the Cincinnati market in the last couple of years. So it’s been a big deal here. I think you could call that maybe a new market from that point of view. And the fact that there’s two additional markets where they’ve gone up to the number one, two, or three in that market that’s probably significant to, to your point.
W. Rodney McMullen: And would over index a little bit for Ohio, especially Cincinnati and a little bit Columbus and some of the other areas. It would over index the further west you go and a little bit in Texas. And the rest would be spread out pretty normal looking.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then I’d like to, you know, you’ve already commented that you are seeing a little slow down in some of the discretionary categories and yet you’re still very excited about the marketplace stores. Do you have any concern that those stores are going to start out more slowly or slow (inaudible) in the next year or so? Because obviously they do carry more discretionary general merchandise. 
David B. Dillon: Actually, I’m not because the marketplace stores win in a variety of ways. Only one of those in some of those products. And while those products may be down on the whole, or at least less than the growth that we were experiencing in some of them, they still are an opportunity for us. So no, I’m not at all discouraged about that.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then I just have one other question back on the topic of inflation. I think you folks have said that CPG inflation is a bit of a tailwind, but the perishable items and more commodity items, are you managing gross profit dollars more than you are managing gross margin and does that have the potential, just optically, mathematically, to make your gross margin percent go down? Even though the dollars may be flat or up?
David B. Dillon: I suppose mathematically. That gets to be pretty hypothetical, but yeah, I think mathematically it certainly could do that. But what we are looking at making sure we maintain the penny gross. But we also are looking, we’re not just doing that. We are also looking at the percentage gross. And most importantly we’re looking at the balance of where our financials come out because, as we said before, we are trying to balance where we end up on gross margin investment and where we have found savings in OG&A. Or if you prefer, our total cost on one side and our selling gross on the other. We take all of our pricing into account on that, including the inflationary environment. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay. The reason I’m asking is because people assume that any decline in your selling gross is absolutely a function of price investments you’ve made where in fact it could be, again, on an end result of how you’re managing the inflation and gross profit dollars.
David B. Dillon: On that point I would agree. Yes. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. My first question for you is on gas. It looks to me like it may have been relatively neutral this quarter. Is that a fair assessment? 
David B. Dillon: If you look at gas for the whole year we would have said, from our perspective, in the fourth quarter it was slightly positive versus the overall year. If you look at it for the year it was almost exactly where we expected it to be and pretty consistent with ’06 when you look at it for the whole year. So slightly positive in the fourth quarter, pretty neutral for the year.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then gas prices right now are rising, obviously, which is not good. But it looks like they increased for almost the entire first quarter last year as well, so to me it seems like the comparison is not very difficult there anyway. Is that true?
David B. Dillon: That we wouldn’t give any additional insight on.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then regarding your guidance. The last two years you kind of got it to 6% to 8% EPS growth and meaningfully exceeded those estimates. You’re guiding to 6% to 10% EPS growth today and saying that if current conditions hold you’ll be at the high end of the range. But it just kind of seems like history would suggest that if current conditions hold there is a possibility that you could do better than that. Is that a fair way to think about it?
David B. Dillon: I think we would position it more in terms of if you look at the targets we’ve given it reflects the fact that we did exceed the last two years and we’ve tried to reflect that up front. So I wouldn’t necessarily assume that.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. And one last question for you on your outlook for capex. Your level of spending increased in ’06 and ’07. I don’t know. Did you give an outlook for 2008? Was it $2 billion?
J. Michael Schlotman: It was in the 8K we filed today and we gave a $2 billion to $2.2 billion range. 
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. How should we think about the level of spend that you’re undertaking right now versus a normalized rate of spend? How much of that is due to the fact that you seem to be more in a remodel cycle? Is this a rate that we should be thinking about longer term?
David B. Dillon: I think there’s two things out there. One is we’ve been very happy with the remodels that we have done. As we said in the prepared remarks, they continue to generate a return above our expectations, which we believe always winds up meaning that we’ve made a very good choice with the use of our shareholders money. And the returns on our new stores, which a few years ago we were disappointed with, continue to improve. If you look at the guidance we gave today as well in the number of new stores and back out the number of acquisitions we had from our store count in ’07 it’s actually a slight increase in the number of new stores in ’08 as a result of our improving returns. And there are a few more marketplace stores in that number which causes the square footage growth to be a little higher than we’ve been tracking. 
W. Rodney McMullen: The other thing is that we’re seeing some nice opportunities with logistics projects and some IT projects that we feel really good about the return potential. And as long as we see those out there we’ll continue to fund them in a balanced sort of way.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you’re seeing in food away from home trends versus food trends at the grocery stores in general. And also, if you look across the spectrum here we have seen some very strong sales out of the club stores, and I’m curious if you think the consumer is shading a little more in that direction now that we’re in a more price focused environment.
David B. Dillon: On the food away from home, I don’t get a lot of data from the restaurant industry, but what little data I see and episodically what I hear from restaurateurs has not been pretty for them that in this economy that their sales have been less than they would like them to be. We have believed this year and this past year and in the year before, even, that trend has actually been of benefit to not just Kroger, but probably to all supermarkets. You saw the supermarkets as a whole, as an industry, are identical sales intended to move up a couple years ago and my personal view is that that’s probably the reason why. But I think that continues.  We think we’re doing a particularly good job in our deli/baker and in some other parts of our store which helps us catch that particular time, which is perhaps one of the reasons that our sales are strong. As for the club stores, I would be speculating if I answered that, but I would think that one of the reasons that you’re suggesting is probably right. That in a tighter economy I could see people turning to a number of places, including our Kroger brand and including the club stores, as a way to save money. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then you mentioned you were probably taking share from some of the independents and those that don’t have scale. Do you think this environment could foster more consolidation? Are those players under more pressure than usual? You’ve made a lot of price investments. I’m curious when you’re doing your price comparisons what are the independents doing with their prices?
David B. Dillon: Well, consolidation is a funny thing. It takes a lot of years. And most industries we’ve watched, it’s not just a linear movement, it’s some starts and stops and some diversions and so forth. But I think it’s generally continuing as it has been continuing. I don’t think that there’s any greater pressure today than there was before or less pressure than there was before. In my view, anyway.  As for pricing, you have been able to see pretty well what we’ve done with our pricing. And I think it’s generally true that relative then to our competitors, our pricing, not in every case but in many cases, has gently improved. If they stayed the same and we lowered our price that’s what would produce that improvement. And I think that’s more of what we’re seeing. I don’t see really any radical change in pricing strategies out in a competitive environment right now.
W. Rodney McMullen: Another thing I’d add on, Dave, if you look at consolidation, if you look at a long-term trend there’s been a consolidation in our industry for 20 years. Certainly don’t see anything that would cause that to change looking forward. that’s something that we’ve been saying for the last five or 10 years, I know for sure. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then lastly on inflation. We’ve seen several periods now of rising inflation. I’m wondering if you think there’s at some point, maybe late in the year, when we’ll lap out of inflationary trends.
David B. Dillon: That’s hard to predict. That’s why I mentioned that in ’08 so far, based on what information we have on cost increases expected this quarter, we don’t think that it’s abating at this point in time. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Stillman (sp) of McKay Shields.
Mark Stillman – MacKay-Shields: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to, I didn’t catch all of the earlier comments. Did you break out on the comp, do you have a sense of price versus volume?
David B. Dillon: It’s pretty even between the two.
Mark Stillman – MacKay-Shields: Okay. Great. And as far as, I think somebody touched on it as far as the economic trends, do you guys discuss traffic at all as far as, you know, since the end of the year?
David B. Dillon: You mean currently in this year?
Mark Stillman – MacKay-Shields: Yeah. Currently. Or even last quarter. Whatever information. I mean, I would assume that you would have, or I’m wondering if there’s some statistical back up.
J. Michael Schlotman: As we said earlier, about half of our identical sales gain came from traffic and about half from higher traffic. Which is pretty much, or from higher sales per customer, and that’s pretty much consistent in the fourth quarter and all of last year.
Mark Stillman – MacKay-Shields: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig of Citi.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Good morning. Can you talk about your fuel strategy as it relates to your promotional efforts and specifically when customers are using their Kroger Plus card or their 1-2-3 Reward MasterCard?
David B. Dillon: Well, we don’t have the same program in every market, but in most markets if you make purchases at Kroger with your Kroger Plus card you’ll get a discount on gasoline. And if you use your 1-2-3 plus Kroger MasterCard, which is from our Kroger Personal Finance Group – and this is a commercial, Deborah – you will get a $0.15 per gallon reduction at the pump if you’ve spent, in most markets, if you’ve spent $100 in purchases. I had my card and got that same discount just this last week.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Okay. Great. And then could you just provide us with an update on Kroger Personal Finance and how has it contributed to your recent results? Also, if you look out further, when can we expect KPF to represent a significant enough driver to your overall results to really see it broken out on your financials?
David B. Dillon: Yeah, I was just up in the KPF office last night and really pleased with the progress they made this past year, but, Rodney, do you want to comment on KPF?
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, to me it’s really two aspects when you look at Kroger Personal Finance. Obviously the business itself, and we have a great partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland. It’s just been outstanding. They really do bring the expertise to the financial industry and we obviously have the connection with the customers and the customer traffic. So working together we’ve been able to create several products that have really been very positive with our customers. The other thing that we really like is the loyalty that it creates from our customers. Clearly we can see a change in customer behaviour when they become a Kroger Personal Finance customer. So it really is both. In terms of at what point does it show up in overall results, I guess it really depends on how you define showing up. Because from a loyalty standpoint we would certainly say that it’s showing up today. One other thing that you may know, when a customer uses a Kroger credit card they earn gift certificates and so far our customers have earned over $40 million worth of gift certificates to reuse at Kroger. And the redemption rate is incredibly high on those, so we know that our customers love that $40 million.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck in 2008. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Deborah. Congratulations to you.
David B. Dillon: Yeah. Congratulations to you.
Deborah Weinswig – Citigroup: Thanks.
David B. Dillon: We’ll take one more question.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Bob Summers of Bear Stearns.
Robert Summers – Bear Stearns: Good morning. You touched on corporate brands. I’d wonder if you could give us some metrics around performance, either talking about increased penetration levels, maybe what the drag to comp has been, and your thoughts on how that progresses through 2008?
David B. Dillon: Well, I don’t know about 2008 for a moment, but our market share on Kroger brands on the whole continued to increase in the year. I don’t think we gave any specific data this time on that. In grocery, which is the way we’ve traditionally looked at it, that definitely has continued to grow. So we’re pleased with that progress. You talked about a drag to comp, I don’t really think it’s causing a drag on our comps because I think it’s improving our sales. But I suppose if a person trades from a higher priced item to this item then you could have some impact on comps. But I don’t think that’s been meaningful. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, if you look in the fourth quarter, we didn’t give the specifics, but we did gain share in both dollars and units. The gain in dollars was a little bit more than units, but if you look at the inflation is a little bit higher in a lot of the corporate brand categories. Especially milk and some of those. 
Robert Summers – Bear Stearns: Okay. And then there’s been a lot of talk about Wal-Mart potentially taking price up at a slower rate than either CPI or product cost inflation. I don’t know, pick your metric. Is that something that you’re seeing?
David B. Dillon: You’ll have to go look in Wal-Mart for yourself. We of course watch them and lots of other competitors to see, but I’m not going to comment on their pricing strategy. 
Robert Summers – Bear Stearns: Okay. And then one last thing. I think you outlined the LIFO charge for next year that’s about on line with what you did this year, but if I try and extrapolate the trend in the fourth quarter I get to a number that’s a lot higher. Help me understand that.
J. Michael Schlotman: Well, the reason the trend looks like that in the fourth quarter, Bob, is that at the end of the third quarter we were projecting $130 million charge for the year and it wound up being a $154 million charge for the year. So we had to take all of that $24 million in the fourth quarter. If we had known at the beginning of the year it was going to be $154 million about $16 million of that $24 million would have been spread over the first three quarters of the year.
Robert Summers – Bear Stearns: Okay. Thank you. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Bob. And before everyone hangs up we just wanted to close with and share a few thoughts with our associates who have joined us, because we encourage them to call in. Once again, congratulations on a great year. I’m particularly pleased with the gains that we continue to make in market share. Those numbers only move in a positive direction when customers choose us over our competition. Our increases to market share mean you are doing what you do so well: making sure our customers want to return to our stores time and time again.  Our performance during the quarter and year points to another significant achievement you should all be proud of because it is the result of your individual contributions. You’ve heard us mention that Kroger continues to make progress in our four key areas: our people, our products, our prices, and the overall shopping experience for our customers. One example where you have a huge impact is in helping to keep costs low. Kroger is able to invest these lower costs in lower prices for our customers because of the choices each of you make on the job every day. Our family, friends and neighbours are making different choices in today’s economy than they did a year ago because household budgets are not as flexible. Your personal commitment makes our lower prices possible. We hope your friends and neighbours appreciate the help that you provide, particularly when they need it most. That completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Thank you foryour patience, ladies and gentlemen. The Q3 2007 The Kroger Co.earnings conference call will begin shortly. Again, thank you for stopping by.  Good day,ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2007 The Kroger Co.earnings conference call. My name is Lisa and I will be yourcoordinator for today. At this time all participantsare in a listen-onlymode. We will be conducting a question andanswer session towards the end of thisconference. (Operator Instructions). I would nowlike to turn the call over toMs. Carin Fike. Please proceed, Ma’am.
Carin Fike: Good morningand thank you for joining us. Before we begin I want to remind you that today’sdiscussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you thatsuch statements are predictionsand actual events or results can differ materially. A detaileddiscussion of the many factorsthat we believe may have a materialeffect on our business on an ongoingbasis is contained in our SECfilings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Our thirdquarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available onour website at www.kroger.com. Now I wouldlike to introduce Mr. David Dillon, Chairman andChief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David B. Dillon: Thank you,Carin, and good morning, everyone. We’re pleased you could join us to reviewKroger’s third quarter 2007 results. With me today are RodneyMcMullen, Kroger’s Vice Chairman, DonMcGeorge, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman,Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Let me begin bysaying we were very pleased with our results this quarter. Our business isrobust and our strategy is working. Our performance this quarter is consistentwith our customer first approach and is yet another example of Kroger’s abilityto continue to deliver financial results in the near termwhile maintaining our focus on investing for the future.  I’ll beginwith a recap of the thirdquarter, year-to-date results and guidance. Rodney will then provide additionaldetails on the thirdquarter results. And after that we’ll be happy totake your questions.  Krogerdelivered another quarter of strong sales performance. Total sales for the third quarterincreased 9.8% to $16.1 billion. And identical supermarket sales increased 7.7%with fuel and 5.7% without fuel. This is the tenthconsecutive quarter Kroger has reportedidentical supermarket sales increases, excluding fuel, in excess of3%.  Our strongidentical sales growth continues to be broad basedacross the company’sgeographic regions and merchandise departments. All of oursupermarket divisions and departments experienced positive identical sales and,in addition,our communit (sic) stores turned in anotherstrong quarter of identical sales growth. Net earnings in the thirdquarter totalled $253.8 million or $0.37 per dilutedshare. These results include a benefit ofapproximately $40 million from the resolutionof certain tax issues during the quarter.Most of this benefit was offset by lower margins from retail fuel operationsand the company’sdecision to accelerate certain initiatives that are part ofKroger’s Customer First Strategy. Net earnings in the same periodlast year were $214.7 million or $0.30 per dilutedshare. Our earningsperformance this quarter was solid. Our strategy continues to deliver earningsgrowth in a variety ofeconomic and competitive conditions which underscores the core strength ofKroger’s business model. Kroger’s strong sales performance in the thirdquarter is the directresult of our associates’ efforts to focus on our customers. Our business modelpositions us well to serve the diverseneeds of our customers. While fuelmargins in the thirdquarter were weaker when compared to the prior year,on theyear-to-year, year-to-date basis they were more normalized. As we have saidbefore, in the fuelbusiness it is notuncommon to see variationsfrom quarter to quarter. It is importantto consider a longer viewwhen analyzing fuel margins to account for these fluctuations because, overtime, our return on assets in the fuelbusiness is well above our cost of capital.  Turning toyear-to-date results, total sales increased 7.6% to $53 billion during the first threequarters of fiscal 2007. For the same period,identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased 5.3%.  Net earningsfor the first threequarters of fiscal 2007 were $857.6 million or $1.22 per dilutedshare. Net earnings for the same periodlast year were $730.1 million or $1.01 per dilutedshare. Based onyear-to-date financial results and current trends, Kroger now expects identicalsupermarket sales growth of approximately 5% for the full yearexcluding fuel sales. The companyexpects earnings per share to slightlyexceed the rangepreviously given of $1.64 to $1.67 per dilutedshare. This earnings guidance includes the lower tax rate due to the resolutionof certain tax issues this quarter and a higherestimated LIFO charge of $130 million, which is $80 million more than the companyoriginally anticipated for fiscal 2007. In addition,Kroger’s dividend currently adds slightly over 1% to shareholder return.  As a reminder, the fourthquarter of fiscal 2006 included an extra weekthat we estimate benefitted our earnings per share by$0.07 per dilutedshare.  Ouryear-to-date performance positions us to deliver a slightlyexpanding operating margin, low double-digitearnings per sharegrowth, and strong identical sales growth in fiscal 2007.Our associates’ focus on building customer loyalty through service, product,and value initiatives remains key to Kroger’sfuture earnings growth. Lookingbeyond 2007, we expect identical supermarket growth in the 3% to 5%range with a slightlyimproving operating margin, excluding the effect ofretail fuel operations.  Now I’d liketo turn the call over toRodney for some additional detail on our third quarter results. Rodney?
W. Rodney McMullen: Thank you,Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we are very pleasedwith Kroger’s results this quarter and they are in line withour business plan. Our associates continue to do a great job at executingour Customer First Strategy and we appreciate their efforts in helping usdeliver another good quarter.  I will now discusssome of the incomestatement components that produced our earnings per share growthin the quarter. On a GAAP basis,Kroger’s third quarter FIFO gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 23.38%of sales, primarily due to the lowermargins associated with fuel sales. Fuel margins fluctuate from quarter toquarter and that is why we take a longer viewto evaluate fuel. In keeping withour strategy, we continue to focus on reducing operating expenses andreinvesting those savings back into customer service, product selection, andpricing. Investments in pricing are reflected in Kroger’ssupermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales, which declined 45 basispoints during the quarter.Reductions in warehousing,advertising, and shrink expenses funded a portion ofthese pricing investments as our FIFO gross margin on non-fuel sales declined34 basis points from the prior year. During recentquarters we have discussed product cost inflationand the impact it has had on ourbusiness. We estimate that our product cost inflationduring the quarter was3%. This figure excludes fuel and utilizes CPI to estimate inflation forproducts in our pharmacydepartment. We continue to experience inflation across many core grocery andperishable categories at a level notseen in severalyears. Product cost inflation has promptedquestions in recentquarters regarding our position on passing inflation costs on to customers.Generally we do pass alongproduct cost inflationover the long term, butthere could be short-termlags created by competitive situations. During the quarter wedid pass along product costs increases. In our view,periods of modest inflation is a positive forour business because inflation tends to improve sales, increase margin dollars,and create greater leverage of fixed costs. Inflationalso creates the LIFO chargethat we recognize quarterly. The currentinflationary environment has caused us toincrease the projectedLIFO charge for the secondquarter in a row. Kroger has 98% of ourproduct inventory on the LIFO methodevaluation. This is a higherpercent than many of our competitors.  Whencompanies elect to use the LIFO methodfor taxes they are required touse it forfinancial reporting as well. While a LIFO chargeis a non-cashexpense it creates cashtax savings. Kroger’s estimated fiscal 2007 LIFO charge will reduce our cashtaxes by approximately $50 million.  Now turningto OG&A. Operating, general, and administrative costs declined 78 basispoints to 17.49% of sales. Excluding the effects ofretail fuel operations, OG&A declined 49 basis points. This decline wasdriven by strong identical sales leverage, increased productivity, and progresswe have made in controllingour utility, health care, and pension expenses. These improvements were reducedby higher credit card fees. Rent and depreciation expenses as a percent ofsales without fuel were comparable to last year.  Kroger’soperating margin on a year-to-datebasis increased three basis points. It increase sevenbasis points excluding fuel, charges for labour unrest in the firstquarter of 2007, and certain legal expenses in 2006. As wehave said before, we do not believethat a singlequarter’s operating margin is the best gaugeof the success ofour business strategy. This is due to the timing ofoperating costs savings and investments in ourbusiness. For the full year in fiscal 2007we continue to anticipate a slightincrease in Kroger’snon-fuel operating margin, which will enable us to deliver low double-digitearnings per share growth.This is a littlebetter than the objectiveswe outlined at the start of the year.  Kroger’searnings per share growththis year is also driven by fewer shares outstanding. We continued ouraggressive stock buy-back program during the quarter,reflecting our judgement that Kroger’s shares represent a compellinginvestment. Kroger repurchased 16.5 million shares of stock in the thirdquarter at an averageprice of $26.77 for a totalinvestment of $442.1 million. At the end of the quarter,201.6 million remained under the $1 billionstock repurchase program we announced in June 2007. Our sharerepurchase and dividend programs deliver substantial value to shareholders.Over the past fourquarters Kroger has returned$1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of sharerepurchases and dividends.  Moving now todebt. Kroger’s net total debt to EBIDTA ratio was 1.97 compared to 2.03 during the same periodlast year. Net total debt was $7.5 billion, an increase of$502 million from a year ago.Total debt was also $7.5 billion, an increase of$528 million from a year ago.  Our strongEBIDTA on a rollingfour-quarter basis enabled us to improve our leverage ratio while investing$2.2 billion in capitalprojects and $1.3 billion to repurchase 47 million shares of stock and pay $197 millionin dividends.This is in line withour long-term financial strategy of maintaining a leverageratio to support a solidinvestment grade rating.  During the thirdquarter, Kroger invested $555.3 million in capitalprojects compared to $414 million a year ago.Total capital projects during the quarterincluded 13 new or expanded stores and 54 remodels. During the thirdquarter we closed seven locations; five of these were operational closures. Totalsupermarket square footage grew 1.8% year over year, excluding acquisitions andoperational closures. We continue to anticipate supermarket square footage growthof 2% in fiscal 2007and we still expect to invest $1.9 billing to $2.1 billion in capitalprojects this year. This estimate excludes spending on acquisitions.  In terms ofcapital allocation, our emphasis remains on store remodels and we are verysatisfied with their performance. Our customers tell us they appreciate them aswell, both in terms oftheir comments and the salesperformance. We havecompleted 155 remodels year to date through the end of the third quarter.That compares to 112 remodels during the same periodlast year.  As you know,improving our return on assets is important to us. On a rollingfour-quarter basis our return on assets improved 74 basis points pre-tax,excluding the effect of the 53rdweek in fiscal 2006.This is on the same basisthat Kroger has consistentlyused to calculate return on assets.  Turning tolabour relations, we’ve reached agreements during the quarter withunions representing our associates in Cincinnati,West Virginia, and in southernCalifornia with Food-For-Less. We also reached an agreementwith the unionrepresenting our associates who work in a warehouse in centralOhio. In Memphis wehave agreed to a contractextension with the union thatrepresents our store associates as negotiations continue there.  In 2008 we willnegotiate contracts covering store associates in Columbus,Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Louisville, Nashville, Phoenix, and Portland. Fair andbalanced contract settlements continue to be ourobjective in allnegotiations. We work to reach balanced agreements that meet our cost efficiencyobjectives and fulfill our commitment to providing our associates with solidwages and benefits. Maintaining this balance allows Kroger to invest in our businessto provide new job opportunities for existing associates and create new jobs for morepeople.  Now I’ll turnit back to Davefor some closing remarks. 
David B. Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. Our quarterly and year-to-dateperformance is a great example of the strategywe have been discussing with you for some time: a sustainable,sales-driven plan that allows us to invest cost savingsinto initiatives that are meaningful to our customers. We continue to execute our strategywell in every area of our business to create value for our shareholders, asevidenced by the results we shared with you today. Now, we would like to take a few momentsto answer your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes fromJohn Heinbockel from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
John Heinbockel –Goldman Sachs: Dave, a couple ofquestions that will tie into your accelerated investment in pricing.Obviously, can you talk to the degree that that tied into the taxbenefit? I assume that was fairly planned. Was that more shelf pricingadjustments or promotional activity? And then how do you measureor have you been able to measure the return onthat investment during the quarter in terms of comp lift, etcetera? 
David B. Dillon: Some of theacceleration of our strategies included some pricing plans, for instance, thatwe have been using in some markets, but not all markets.We have elected to extend those to some additional markets that we had beenplanning to do, but we actually planned to do it just a little bitlater. We decided to do it when we did because, as we’ve said before, we’re going to look at theaffordability of the choices we make in some ofthese strategies. I think it’s important to recognize it wasn’t justsome promotional strategy that we did sort of on a whim becausewe had money available to spend, but rather it was part ofa plan where we actually had these strategies worked out in our mindsand over time and we’re trying to pick the best timeand best circumstance and best competitive situation in which tointroduce them. So that’s really all it was and that’s how we tried to approach it this lastquarter and that’s actually how we’ve been approaching it for sometime. Both of the two or threestrategies I’m thinking about mostly relate to shelf pricing or pricingstrategies as opposed to a short promotion.
W. Rodney McMullen: The other thing, Dave, that I would add on top of that, in somemarkets there were some non-price initiatives, too. If you look at one examplewould be products where it’s ready-to-heat type products. Certainly wecontinue to accelerate the roll-out of that in differentmarkets, but when you look at when you first put that product in placeobviously you have a very high shrink on that product until the customers get accustomedto buying it. So there’s initiatives such as that and some service initiatives thatwere also part of the acceleration.
John Heinbockel –Goldman Sachs: Was it driven more by timing, anyway, by the fact thatyou had the tax benefit or you saw something in terms of the macro or thecompetitive environment that caused you to move themforward?
David B. Dillon: Well, it’s really all of the things youdescribed and a whole lot more. At the beginningof the year we had a specific plan in mind and we have a number of strategies, some service strategies, some productstrategies, some pricing strategies, and we had animplementation schedule. But in the lastseveral years we have varied that implementation schedule a little bitby how much we could afford in terms of the situation.But we’ve also varied it by the opportunity that we saw. In somemarkets if the competitive situation we think could benefit from theintroduction of something we may have moved it ahead of the scheduleand vice-versa. So competitive openings could have an effect onthat. But it really is all of those factors. Now, the tax amount, of course, at the beginningof the year we didn’t know what the tax amountwould be. It’s not uncommon to have adjustments, but this is a littlelarger than – I don’t know if it’s larger than normal, but larger than a usual taxadjustment. As a result, when we saw what that was and when we saw how the gas marginswere faring in the quarter, the two we thought would balance out sufficiently well that we could move ahead onsome of these other initiatives. So we choseto.
John Heinbockel –Goldman Sachs: All right. And then just finally, if you take out theinvestments would it be fair to say that food gross margin, your selling gross margin would have beendown modestly or no? You try to separate this out. Because obviously theseinvestments are not necessarily, they’re not one time, but they’re not necessarilygoing to get this every quarter either.
David B. Dillon: Some of the investmentin the quarter was the ongoing investment from the last threequarters. In other words, you get somerolling effect there. So our margin would have been down irrespective of these additionalinvestments that we chose to make. However, we also are, as we’ve said all along,trying to match up at least on an annual basis – and even to a certainextent on a quarterly basis – what our savings our in OG&A orour savings in shrink or logistics or advertising, and take those savings and see what wethen have available to reinvest in appropriateways and ways that we think would benefit the customers grow the sales andthen therefore produce an improved result for theshareholders. So it would have been down anyway.  This was not a case of weinvested all of the down gross margin. The sellinggrowth we identified was 45 basis points. That decline was not all driven. In fact, it was only a small partdriven by these new initiatives. It would be more drivenby the overall plan and our overall picture on OG&A. 
John Heinbockel –Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
David B. Dillon: Does that help, John?
John Heinbockel –Goldman Sachs: Yeah, yeah. That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Whitmer from ClevelandResearch Company. Please proceed.
Jason Whitmer –Cleveland Research Company: Hi, good morning. Dave, could you talk a little bitabout the price promotional landscape that you might seestructurally changing, whether at Kroger or in the channel at large, such as an evolving high-low or an EDLP blendor even using fuel, for that matter, as a pricevehicle. Maybe some pricing software. What’s the overallimpact of a lot of these changing landscapes on thecompetitive market and really overall in the marginoutlook.
David B. Dillon: Well, I don’t actually see it muchdifferent than I have for the last several quarters. I don’t, I do not see it gettingmore competitive, but I also don’t see it gettingless competitive. I assume the pricing software you’re talking about are some of the priceoptimization software packages out there and the number ofpeople who use those and use them effectively, I think they help you thinkabout your pricing strategy. But overall pricing strategies are chosen bywhat gross margins they produce and the grossmargin that you require as a company is predicated on the returnyou’re trying to achieve and your coststructure.  As you know here, we have tried to drive our sales, we’vetried to improve on our cost structure, therefore allowing us room to invest on other thingsthat were meaningful. Some of it’s been priced, but much of it has been onadditional service, which of course then goes back into OG&A costs,training, and other product areas, which often will end up in the gross,sometimes affects this rank, as Rodney described earlier. So I don’t think the current environment is much different than what we’ve seen for the lastseveral quarters. There is a change, of course, going on in the overalleconomy. Inflation has picked up a bit. Mike will probably talk a little bitmore about inflation if you have questions, but inflation was the highest in the thirdquarter than we’d seen in a long time. And I say highest, but I say that carefully because it’s still pretty darn moderate. Andmoderate inflation, as Rodney points out, we view as generally helpful to us.And so I think that’s the environment we see in the economy as a result I don’t think that’s changinganybody’s behaviour. At least not that I’ve seen.
J. MichaelSchlotman: The other thing is, you know, we would work with dunnhumby a lot, ourmerchandising teams, in terms of how to approach pricing – both every-day pricing,promotional, and special offers, too. That is one of the thingsthat dunnhumby has been especially helpful for us. 
Jason Whitmer –Cleveland Research Company: I guess that leads right into my follow up then. Is it fair tosay, and I don’t know how you’d characterize this, but how much more effectiveor profitable have your programs and deals been, either on the impact todrive – you know, drive the business is very evident, but the overall flow throughof that in a vacuum, has that improved substantially over the lastcouple of years?
David B. Dillon: I think we have improved theeffectiveness of our spend. And we have improved that through theintersection of several things, one of which is dunnhumby looking at data. Butalso I think it’s just within Kroger the desire to be more datadriven. That is, what are the results of the choices we made? And then be willing tore-evaluate choices we made and modify them as we think appropriate given the facts. AndI think those elements have created a moreeffective approach to spending. More effective in what wespend our pricing on, more effective in every-daypricing, more effective in what we spend our promotional money on, and frankly more effectiveon our investments in product and in the shopping experience in the stores andin the service metrics. All of those Ithink have been improved by our focus on what are the factsshowing us, what does the data show us?
Jason Whitmer –Cleveland Research Company: And is there anything to garner from the data as it relates tofuel this quarter? Is it all just kind of the delta from what you pay and whatyou buy it for relative to what you’re giving it away for at the pump ondiscounts? I don’t know how you take a look at that, butcertainly it’s one of the bigger pinches you’ve had in a long time ifnot ever on fuel margins.
David B. Dillon: Well, it’s one of the biggerswings we’ve had from last year to this year in the quarterand from second quarter to third quarter this year. Those were bigger swingsthan I think we typically would have seen, so it sort offocuses or magnifies the effect. Fuel margins typically end up being what they are. In otherwords, we don’t control those very much. We can control them a little bit,but the costs of the commodity is what it is and the retailprice is reflective of exactly the retailbusiness in each community that we serve. It’s a little bitlike we’ve discussed on milk, for instance, that you can’t just simply set a retail at whateveryou want it to be because in gasoline when you do your volumedrops off substantially.  So for fuel for us, we look at the resultsover a longer period of time. We look at, well, the threequarters, for instance, is a reasonable period of time, but I even like a full year orlonger to understand what the margins are doing. And on a three-quarter-to-date basis our fuel margins are a little belowwhere they were last year, but more normalized, we think. Much more normalized.And so we had a benefit in the second quarter of which we identified as higher than normal and wehad an impact this quarter which was clearly lower than normal.
W. Rodney McMullen: Jason, I do want toremind you of one thing. In your question I thought I heard you reference the effect ofpromotions on lower fuel margins. I do want toremind you that our fuel rewards program that discounts fuel for purchasesinside the grocery store is charged against grocery store idents so that the 5.7%identicals we announced excluding fuel are reducedfor the cost of that program there, not charged against fuel operations.
Jason Whitmer –Cleveland Research Company: That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
David B. Dillon: That’s a good point becauseas you look at our gross profit investment in the quarter tothe extent that we spent more money on fuel promotions, it would showup in the non-fuel gross profit investment.
Jason Whitmer –Cleveland Research Company: Great. Thank you. 
David B. Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from LehmanBrothers. Please proceed.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: As long as we’re talking about fuel I want to go back, Dave, to yourquestion about, your comment about the return onassets being higher than your cost ofcapital for fuel. It’s also clearly a veryvolatile business, and I don’t know if you perceive that volatility as risk,but if you were to see it as risk and make a riskadjustment would you still say that the return is acceptable? Because I think that’s what we see now asmore volatility.
David B. Dillon: Yeah, Meredith, I absolutely would. Volatility in this sense,you can take an individual quarter and make a case to say,well, fuel wasn’t a good deal. But if you take, in a year thatI’ve looked at it or longer periods than a year, too, Ithink you would always come to the sameconclusion. I don’t remember any single year of where I thought it was not a goodinvestment. And as a result the volatility is really simply the volatilityof the commodities and represents, when you see highvolatility, sometimes we can actually make more margin when the cost is morevolatile. But just because, for instance, the cost of fuelis going up, it’s going up steadily and predictably, we don’t make more money in thatsituation. Or if it’s going down predictably and settling may be the samething. But when there’s some volatility there that tends to improve the marginsbecause we don’t have quite as much volatility in our retailas we do in our costs. I don’t know if you want to add.
W. Rodney McMullen: Well, I was just going to say, if you look at it over an annualbasis the volatility isn’t all that high.
David B. Dillon: Maybe that’s the best wayto –
W. Rodney McMullen: If you look at it over a two-yearbasis, rolling basis, it’s almost non-existent. Now, the shorterperiod of time you get the more volatility there is. And if you look at fuelmargins for the year in terms of where we budgeted them for the year andwhere we are and where we think we’ll be, we think we’re going to be pretty darnclose to what the estimates were. But when you look at it in the quarter,as you know, in the second quarter, as Dave mentioned, and we did on the call, the secondquarter was a little higher than normal, third quarter’s a little lowerthan normal. But when you look at itcumulatively it looks like it’s going to be pretty darnclose to where we thought it would be. 
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Of course, it’s a bit of a strain for the market tothink of in a two-year time frame. Another question about fuel – ---Interjection Another question about fuel. You haven’t – Pardon me?
David B. Dillon: Meredith?
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Yeah?
David B. Dillon: Let’s go back to what you just said.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Pardon me?
David B. Dillon: Let’s come back to what you just said because you don’thave to look at two years to get a clear picture. 
J. MichaelSchlotman: Keep in mind what Rodney just said, and that is we expect to be very closeto what we expected fuel to deliver for this year. 
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Yeah.
J. MichaelSchlotman: It’s not a two-yearlook we’re saying and all Rodney was trying to do was the longertime frame you look at the less volatile it is, but typically within one of our fiscal years we’ve been fairlyclose to what we expect fuel to deliver to the bottomline on an annual basis. There’s obviously some variations on yourexpectations, but what we see today we’re going to wind up prettyclose for this fiscal year.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: I might be a cynic and say the market has troublelooking at even a whole year time frame. Just talking about sales, the benefit,fuel clearly is something that helps you drive food sales. You didn’t talkabout it so much this time, but you are veryeffective in using your pricing on fuel as a way to drivefood sales. Do you have any numbers where you can sort of quantify that?
David B. Dillon: Actually we don’t. We have internally some sense of the numbers,but nothing that we would want to share. Suffice it to say,though, is that we do believe that there is some benefit to our grocery store business byhaving fuel stations out front. Theconvenience of those, the tie-in with fuel promotions, all of thathelps. 
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Okay.
W. Rodney McMullen: The other thing, Meredith, and we’ve talked about it on previouscalls, overall we believe that higher fuel costs is a positive forour type of business overall, our industry. And it’s one less trip thatsomebody has to make in our stores and our typical customer only has to drive a mile or twoto get to one of our stores. We think all thosethings tied together is really what drives our identical sales. 
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then I just want to kind of go back to, I thinkthis is the question John Heinbockel was giving you, I think the market has a tendency to see tax asbeing something completely independent of operations. But it sounds likeyou don’t think about it that way, that you think about tax as an expensethat’s being managed and look at how thatimpacts the bottom line and then you manage your business to some extent aroundthat. Is that fair to say?
David B. Dillon: It’s fair to say that welook at it actually from lots of different vantage points, but first vantagepoint is that it is part of our cash flow. And so, if you look at our overallresults as we look at them, we look at our overall cash flow and all of the thingsthat affect it. We do tend to separate tax swings like this, but also gasoline swingslike this from our day-to-day operations for us to get a sense of howour business model is working. When you take those two elements out of ourquarter our quarter looks just peachy. And as a result Ithink you could look at it from either of those vantage points and come out feeling asoptimistic as I do about where the quarter was.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Would it be fair to say that youearned $0.37 or that you beat, if you took out both the fuel and the taxbenefit? That you were better in thisquarter?
David B. Dillon: Hm. I’m not sure how to answer that. Mike, do you want totry to piece together the math? Or Rodney, do you have a picture? 
J. MichaelSchlotman: We would have been, if you take out, if you were to takeout the tax end of fuel we would have been very happy with the growth weposted this quarter.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Okay. Great.
David B. Dillon: That’s a fair way tocharacterize it, yes.
Meredith Adler –Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from FTNMidwest. Please proceed.
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: Hello. Good morning, everyone.
David B. Dillon: Good morning, Chuck.
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: What do you specify the tax benefit amount was?
David B. Dillon: It’s $40 million.
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: Four-zero?
David B. Dillon: Yeah, four-zero. That’s correct.
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: All right. And what would you say the gas amount wasthat Meredith was just referencing as being an unusual pointof pressure on the gross margin?
David B. Dillon: We didn’t give the specificnumber other than saying that when you look at the fuelmargin and the other initiatives that we invested in used up,covered most of that $40 million.
W. Rodney McMullen: And obviously some of it did follow the bottomline because we did post $0.37.
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: Gotcha. All right. Andwhat about your (inaudible) guidance for the full yearof 5%, that’s a little less than year to date. Are we simplylooking at the effect of the extra week last year?
David B. Dillon: No, we actually left a tiny bit of an element ofconservatism in case the economy in some way impacts us that we can’t see it. It’snot trying to signal anything other than we were happy with our sales lastquarter and we expect to be happy with our quarter sales this quarter. 
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: All right. Do you anticipate a second half of this year, Dave, similar to the first halfwhere there’s a little bit more inflation catch up as the half wentby? Inflation catch up in terms of shelf pricing.
David B. Dillon: In the quarter, we recovered the cost,product cost increases that we experienced. And we would expect that that would be truebarring some unusual situation. We would expect that would be true in the fourthquarter, too. The rate of inflation in the third quarter we’ve already described as being the highestreally this year and for some time, but still moderate. We expect, based onwhat we’ve seen so far, that the fourth quarter will be verysimilar to what the third quarter was on inflation. So I wouldexpect whatever benefits were derived in the thirdquarter I would think you’d see the same kindof picture in the fourth quarter. 
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: All right. And all that $40 million tax benefit is hard cash?
J. MichaelSchlotman: What it is, Chuck, is it’s a reduction ofexpected payments. We would have expected to be paying $40million than we ultimately are going to pay. It wouldn’t necessarily be cash thisquarter. The payment may or may not have been due this quarter, but ultimately it will be a reduction of$40 million in cash taxes. Exactly what month I would have had to write thatcheque, I couldn’t really zero in on that. 
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: But pretty much in fiscal ’07of that? 
David B. Dillon: Yes. 
Chuck Cerankosky –FTN Midwest Securities: Gotcha. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Curry from UBS. Pleaseproceed.
Neil Curry – UBS: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I don’t think it’s a surprisethat you’re investing cost savings into price and other initiatives to drive sales becausethat’s what you’ve been doing for the lastnumber of years. I think just the timing wassomewhat of a little bit of a shock to the street after what happened in the secondquarter and I think you indicated the thirdquarter might have similar characteristics.  You indicated that it wasn’t dueto any sort of increase or decrease in specificenvironment, but you did talk about looking for the bestcompetitive situation to re-invest. So what is the bestcompetitive situation? Is it when customers aren’t expecting it and you cansurprise them with lower prices and that’s when you get the bestreturn on the investment? Or is it purely thatyou felt that with the economy weakening that you just wanted to support your valuemessage?
David B. Dillon: The answer is actually yes on both of those. For me, as an operator, Ilike to see both extremes as places you would invest, places where you feel youneed to, because of defensive moves, but also places you invest because youwant to because you sense that it willimprove your sales. The time you don’t want to invest is when you think putting additionalmoney won’t produce additional sales and won’t have a desiredeffect with the customer. And there are times whenthat happens. If the customers are behaving in a sense that says they don’t want to spend money you can sense thatoften where your sales are and that’s not a particularly good time to spend money. But we’re not sensing thatsituation right now.
W. Rodney McMullen: Neil, the otherthing, and I’m confirming my numbers here quickly, but you talked about the secondquarter, but if you remember year-to-date at the secondquarter our operating margin had increased five basis points and that increase in ouroperating margin now, and that excludes fuel, is up to seven basis points. So I think on a year-to-datebasis we are executing what we’ve told the world thatwe’re going to execute.
Neil Curry – UBS: Sure, I think it was just the grossmargins in the second quarter. And maybe we misinterpreted the commentson inflation continuing into third quarter meaning that the grossmargin growth ex-fuel would continue in the thirdquarter. But that’s our problem, not yours.
J. MichaelSchlotman: But as we’ve tried to tell everybody for the last twoor three years, we are clearly focused on our operating margin because when we do havesavings we do expect to invest them while early in ouroperating margin slightly on a year-on-yearbasis.
Neil Curry – UBS: Well, that’s a greatstrategy and no problem with that. Just another question. I just wondered if you had anyearly comments on Tesco’s fresh and easy format? It looks as ifthey’re going to quickly saturate at least the Phoenixand Vegas markets over the next year or so with sort of stores every couple of miles and obviously clearly low prices. Iwonder what your early take was on what impact the prices,not necessarily market share, but the pricescould have on your offer in those markets.
David B. Dillon: Well, I won’t specifically address their pricing, but Iwill comment. I’ve been to several of the Tescostores in a couple of different markets. As we’ve said before, we have alwaysassumed that Tesco would come to the U.S. We’rethe biggest market around the world andthey would need to come here for their growth. And we’re quite comfortable in ourstrategy. In fact, our strategy was designed knowing that someone like Tescowould be here. As I’ve looked at theirstores I see a lot of positive things about their stores. Actually, more positivethings than even have been written about. I think they’ve done a nice job.But one thing though that is clear, and that’s more clear about Kroger, isfirst we take Tesco and other competitors like that very seriously and secondis that at Kroger we will improve as a result ofthis new competition. Those are the importantmessages from our vantage point. What individual effect they may have in individualmarkets, what the pricing strategy may affect I don’t want to speculate at this point.
Neil Curry – UBS: Okay. And just finally on the communit(sic) consumer, how do you think your consumers feel right now? Do you see anyevidence of trading down to private label products or that sort of thing?
David B. Dillon: We do not see any big swings in customer behaviour. Now, obviously smaller, more subtle changes maynot be as evident. We have said before, and I still think it’s true, twothings about this, one is that as customers feel pinched one of the reactionsthat often occurs is going to restaurants less often and instead going tosupermarkets where it’s less expensive to prepare a meal for a family oreven for an individual person. And we do think we’vebeen seeing some of that for some time now. Not just in the lastquarter, but for a long time.  And second is that we don’t refer, especially now in the lastquarter or so, we don’t refer to buying our Kroger brand as trading down. Weactually see that as trading up because the customers are learningthat the product quality in our Krogerbrand is not only as good as but often better than the leadingnational brands and it costs less money. So what’s notto like about that? But we’re not seeing a change in behaviour,is the bottom line of your question. We’re not seeing a change in behaviour,certainly not in the third quarter or anything that we saw in the datathere.
Neil Curry – UBS: No, I didn’t mean to bedisrespectful about your product brand.
David B. Dillon: I didn’t take it that way.I’m using this as an opportunity for a commercial.
Neil Curry – UBS: And would that be consistenton the non-food size of the businessas well in some of the larger stores? 
David B. Dillon: Don-food is a littleharder to read because of seasonal impact and weather impact. So we haveseen a little more softness in the drug GM side of ourbusiness than we’ve seen in the other parts of our business. But as we’ve identified, it’s a positivedepartment. At least I believe I’m correct in mystatement. I’m looking over to be sure the numbers are right. But I’m not reading anything into that right now aboutconsumer behaviour because we’re not a real largenon-food merchant, you know, like a departmentstore might be or some of the other mass merchants. 
W. Rodney McMullen: And we also have one extra day between now and Christmas.Until you get through the complete cycle you don’t know exactly where you are relativeto that.
David B. Dillon: Yeah, that does make it a little bithard to read is the shifting of shopping patterns with Christmas falling as it does. 
Neil Curry – UBS: Thank you very much.
David B. Dillon: Sure. Thanks, Neil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Husson with HSBC.Please proceed.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Yeah, I guessthe firstquestion is just a plea givenyou’re a steady-eddykind of company. You’re not doing our forecasting credibility any good at all the way you comeout with quarterly earnings. So perhaps youcould give us a little bitof advance warning on big things liketax charge changes to makethis whole thing seem like you’re not making it up as you goalong. To that end, what is the tax rate going to be for the fourthquarter in the year?
W. Rodney McMullen: If you look at it for the fourthquarter, we expect it to be about 38%,which is what we estimate it for the yearstarting out. For the whole yearestimate.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Okay. Andthen the other thingis, when you’re looking at yourindividual reporting companies, you know, they have to make bonus somehow. Ifyou could just refresh everybody on how the individualreporting companies make bonus and how you make bonus. Is it fair to themto get them to pay or to investback into EBIDTA, if you like, a tax benefitwhich may not have impacted their bonus? How do you get around that?
David B. Dillon: I have tothink about the way thatwould impact. I think first of all the bonus, Idon’t think it would haveany effect. The bonus isbased upon, that portion of the bonus isbased on EBIDTA. For our divisions and for our officer group, for generaloffice here. And I don’t think that would affect EBIDTA in any way thatI can think of.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Oh, no. To the extent thatyou had a tax benefitand you spent the tax benefitback in EBIDTA.
David B. Dillon: Well, if we –
Mark Husson – HSBC: You’ve usedEBIDTA, haven’t you, because you’ve got some tax money?
David B. Dillon: Yeah. If wespent it all and had nothingto show for the spendingthen it would havehurt bonuses. But if you look at our view, myview is that the money wespent on things like we’ve described improves our sales and ultimately improvesour earnings. And our EBIDTA. And develops a more positiveoutlook for our shareholders and certainly more positive for us. I think the way the bonus is setup for individual divisions or for general office or for me, it is prettyclearly in alignmentwith the shareholderbenefits in short runand the shareholderbenefits in the long run becausewe take elements based on identical sales growth, EBIDTA, performance on ouroverall strategy in terms of howwe’re producing on things like our customer first tracker that we’ve describedbefore. Things like that. And then a portion oncapital spending and the effectiveuse of capital spending and hitting our targets on capital spending. Those are the elements andthose are very alignedwith shareholder objectives too. 
Mark Husson – HSBC: Sure. Onlonger term, absolutely. I’m just wondering, given what the performance(inaudible) whether you’ve made any changes to the accrualsyou’ve been making for bonuses for this year.
J. Michael Schlotman: No. I mean,other than being consistent, pretty consistent throughout the year.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Okay. Great.And then just one sort of bigger picture question. When you look at Tesco’sformat of 10,000 square feet, about four times the size of youraverage convenience store and about a quarter the size of youraverage supermarket, when you think about formats I know you’ve spent some timeinvestigating in largerformats and discount formats. When you think about capital dollars how do you thinkabout allocating those dollars going forward in formatsense?
W. Rodney McMullen: If you look,as you know, in one of the comments wecontinue to focus quite a bit ofcapital on remodelling existing stores. If you look at in terms ofrelative to formats, what we believe works the best is tohave a complimentof several different formats in a market. So if you look at a market likePhoenix or a market likeWichita, Kansas, might be a betterexample, where you’ll see marketplacestores, regular supermarkets, and also convenience stores tied together. So it’s from a customerstandpoint we really are trying tohave where a customer canengage with us multiple formats and we believe that’s most effective. So we’re reallylooking at all of themtogether rather than each one individually.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Is the marketplaceformat now performing at groupaverages in terms ofreturn on capital?
W. Rodney McMullen: At least.
Mark Husson – HSBC: Okay. Great.Thank you very much.
W. Rodney McMullen: And one otherthing, just FYI for everyone, we did open up a newmarketplace market in Tucson,Arizona, this week. We opened our first marketplace store in Tucson andthat is the first marketthere. We have another one that will open in a couple ofweeks there too. 
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Todd Duvick from Banc of America. Please proceed.
Todd Duvick – Banc of America:  Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking myquestion. This is on the debt side. With respect to the debt that is maturingin March 2008 I believe there are two issues totalling about $950 million.Given that your policy has changed such thatyou’re no longer focusing on debt pay down are we to assume that you will refinancethat in the capital market?
David B. Dillon: I wouldn’tnecessarily be definitiveexactly what I’m going to do as that debtmatures. Do keep in mind that whilewe may not be targeting reducingthe absolutedollar of debt outstanding we do continue toexpect to manage our leverage ratio at a level thatwill keep us triple B, a solidinvestment grade rating. So it’s notthat we’re going to totally ignore what our debt levels are. We do expect tocontinue to manage it on a ratio basis.
Todd Duvick – Banc of America: Okay. And so I guess justdepending on market conditions you’ll decide closer to time what you’re goingto be doing in terms of anyrefinancing?
David B. Dillon: I would look at it the way we didsome refinancings earlier this year. We would probably make sure that the market isripe and receptive to an offeringfrom Kroger on the rightparticular day versus being forced to do it on anyparticular day. We would look for the rightopportunity rather than feeling like we have to do something. 
Todd Duvick – Banc of America: Okay. That’shelpful. Thank you.
W. Rodney McMullen: And weobviously like the direction ofoverall rates at the moment, too,and where they seem to be going.
David B. Dillon: Even with the higherspreads the couponswould still wind up beingattractive, particularly compared to the debt that ismaturing.
Todd Duvick – Banc of America: Okay. That’sgreat. Thank you.
W. Rodney McMullen: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Bob Summers from Bear Stearns. Please proceed.
Bob Summers – Bear Stearns: Good morning.Just in terms ofacquisition market given overall operating conditions and maybe a pullback in privateequity, are you startingto see a loosening upat all in either the availabilityof assets or price points?
W. Rodney McMullen: I wouldn’t say in terms of ifyou look at the flow there’s muchof a change. And so far I thinkpeople still have a prettypricey assumption in terms ofvaluation. And as you know, we kind of have the sameapproach, whether the market isstrong or weak in terms ofwhat’s the value that it adds for us.And in existingmarkets it’s really looking at specificreal estate opportunities. To go into new markets it has to be a good solidasset with good market share before we would look at it seriously.  But reallynot seeing much change. I thinkpeople are stillexpecting that it’s a short termrather than long term andvaluations still need to come down to make a little bitmore sense of it, I think.
Bob Summers – Bear Stearns: Okay. Andthen kind of a pointedquestion. These unusual items that we’ve had, you know, have become a littleprobably too usual over the last six or so quarters. Aswe continue to manage through this customer first approach, I mean, when can westart to see maybe a moreconsistent shareholder friendly approach to managing the business?
W. Rodney McMullen: Actually, I’mnot sure I fully understand what it is you’resaying, but for us unusual items are things thatwe think are importantfor you to know in order foryou to understand what’s happening in ourbusiness. And our management team here tries to call out those things that are good for usand those things that are bad for us. So that youwould have a clearerpicture, the same picturethat we would look at as the businessrolls forward. As a result, Idoubt that you’ll find a time when wedon’t call out some things. I mean, there may be somequarters where nothing happened that’s unusual enough that we ought to point it out to you,but we try to play it right down the middle bycalling out the good and the bad where wesee it and when wethink it is importantto you. And we thinkwe have been managing the business nowfor several years in what we viewto be a shareholderfriendly environment. If you look at the summation ofthis year, strong identical sales, low double-digitearnings per sharegrowth, a sustainablemodel going forward, all of ourmetrics are lookingbetter, our leverage ratio has improved.
J. Michael Schlotman: Slightlyimproving operating margins.
W. Rodney McMullen: The operatingmargins have slightly improved. 
J. Michael Schlotman: And returned a billion and a half dollarsto shareholders.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yeah. I mean,if you look at how we spentthe cash flow that’s all from a shareholderpoint of view is a good thing.We think the way the metricsought to be viewed are positive andwe think calling out these unusual items are helpful toyou, not hurtful to you. We could have left them all alone thisquarter and you wouldn’t have known the difference.Well, you would have known the differencebecause our stock would have been up $3.00.
David B. Dillon: Or the tax rate would havebeen obvious too.
W. Rodney McMullen: Yeah.
David B. Dillon: I mean, Bob,we don’t mind pointedquestions whatsoever, but we actually do think that so far year todate and what we expect to deliver for the year isgoing to wind up being a shareholderfriendly year.
Bob Summers – Bear Stearns: Okay. Andwhen do you address the buy-back?You’ve almost completed the June ’07stub. 
W. Rodney McMullen: You know,that was, we still have $200 million left as of the end of the quarter.That will depend on the stock priceand the board’sdesire to give us an additional authorization.
Bob Summers – Bear Stearns: Well,unfortunately you’re getting an attractiveentry point today. Thanks.
Operator: Our nextquestion comes from Mark Wiltamuth from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: I just wantedto clarify a little biton the acceleratedinitiatives under the CustomerFirst Strategy. You talked about that being a little bitgross margin and OG&A investment. Can you just talk a little bitmore about how much was OG&A and some of the elementsunder that Customer First Strategy you were really emphasizing here?
David B. Dillon: No, I don’tthink we’ll try to quantify it. We were just trying to give you someillustrations. And I don’t want to overplay that additional investment. We didcomment earlier that the decline in our sellinggross was not primarily driven by accelerating investments, but rather by ouroriginal plans and the continuationof our original plans. So I don’tthink you should read too much into our gross margin or OG&A, either one,as a result ofthose accelerated investments. They were meaningful, but they were notmeaningful enough to turn the (inaudible).So I think the bigger issuewas the $40 million in tax benefitswas, much of it was offsetby the margins in fuel and wehad a little leftover for this additional investment and we had a little leftover to drop to the bottom line.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: So you wouldcharacterize the margin storyas kind of getting back to your normal strategy of reinvesting gross margininto the business.
W. Rodney McMullen: I mean, wedid invest dollars into gross margin and somebody made, I forget who it was, made the same commenta second ago, it might havebeen Neil, relative to you would have expected the secondquarter to continue. When you think about gross margins on a year-to-yearcomparison you have to think about what happened in the prior yearand if you think about the secondquarter of ’06 versus the secondquarter of ’07 one of the things thatcaused gross margin to expand in the secondquarter of ’07 is we made some pretty big investments in the secondquarter of ’06. If you look at the thirdquarter of ’06 as compared to the thirdquarter ’05, that margin difference was very, very minor. And so if you look at our marginson that kind of a basis youhave to understand what happened in the prior yearwhen you say we went upor down as compared to the prior year. The secondquarter was frankly a littleeasier to have expanding margins because we made pretty big investments the prior year. The thirdquarter of this year as compared to the priorquarter of last year, it’s reasonable to expect when last year’s quarter didn’thave a lot ofinvestments that that will happen this year. 
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Isthere anything we should be thinkingabout for the fourthquarter coming up?
W. Rodney McMullen: Only that weexpect the year to wind up with the metrics wehad and I think if we hit those we’re going to be pretty happywith what we delivered on a full-yearbasis. Certainly compared to what return there will be for the shareholdersin addition towhat we expected at the beginning ofthe year. It looks likewe’re on track to have another year where we exceed every promise that we madeto our shareholders.
Mark Wiltamuth – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thankyou.
W. Rodney McMullen: Thanks.
David B. Dillon: Operator,this will be our lastquestion.
Operator: And our lastquestion comes from Ed Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Yeah, hi.Good morning.
David B. Dillon: Good morning,Ed.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: I was hopingyou guys could just help me work throughsome numbers. I was just looking at what youpresented and it seems to me that core gross re EBIDTA, ifwe were to sort of take out fuel all together,was probably up somewhere in the high singleto maybe even lowdouble-digits given almost the 6% comp andwhat looks to be about 15basis points of margin expansion. Is that a fairstatement?
David B. Dillon: Yes.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. So given thatyour reported EBIDTA was down modestly it looks likefuel obviously was down significantly and potentially even incurred a loss thisquarter. Would that be right?
David B. Dillon: It wouldn’t be a loss, no.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. Butthere’s been a lot ofquestions asked about the volatilityof fuel, but can you just maybe help us understand why quarter to quarterthere’s so muchvolatility in thatbusiness?
David B. Dillon: Well, twothings you should think about. First, if you look at last yearversus this year, we think about pennies of margin per gallon. Wedidn’t, it wasn’t quitehalf this year versus last year, but darn close. And the same kind ofswing occurred from the secondquarter to the thirdquarter. If you took the secondquarter as a number andthen looked at the thirdquarter it was almosthalf in the thirdquarter. And what that suggests, and I think it’s true, is that in the thirdquarter last year and in the secondquarter this year we had unusually high gas margins and in the thirdquarter this year we had unusually low gas margins. So you had sortof a doubleswing. When you’re comparing to the previousyear, that’s why you had such wide swings like that. But when youlook at the course of the year, yearto date this year, we’re a little bitunder where we were last year, but not much, on a year-to-datebasis through three quarters. So it tends tosmooth itself out over the course ofeven three quarters. And certainly over the year wethink it will havesmoothed itself out. That’s I think a fair way todescribe it.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Is thatvolatility related to the change in price?
David B. Dillon: It’s relatedto the interactionbetween the retail priceat the pump and the cost of the commoditythat we buy to fill. It’s really a cash marketand what you see is a cash market in the sense thatas you see us buyingfuel several times a week foreach station, replenishing that immediately, but as costs go up, costs go down,the costs ongasoline change not onlyevery day, but every minute. That kind of volatility just produces differences in margin. It’s beentrue, we’ve been in the fuelbusiness, at least I’vebeen involved in the fuelbusiness even before I was in thisbusiness, Dillons was in it since 1960,and through all the time I’vewatched it it’s alwaysbeen the same. Youcan’t try to judge what’s happening with fuel in any one weekor any one quarter. You have to look at a couple ofquarters or three quarters or a year to get a good senseof that because of all of the volatilityof the cost and the volatilityof the pump. It’s the most pricecompetitive item that we would sell. It reacts notdaily in price, butevery hour. If you were to see a change in the localmarkets you would change your retailprice. That’s just the nature ofthat business.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Can wegeneralize and say that youmade maybe more or less money as prices, as cost increases?Or you make less money as costs go up and more money –
David B. Dillon: I’ll letRodney answer that because we actually have studied that. 
W. Rodney McMullen: Yeah, in terms ofyour comment, that’s correct. As a general rule– it’s not always true – but as a generalrule, when costs go up margins contract. When costs come down margins expand.As a general rule.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. Great.And then just last question for you. Any insight on your capex plans for nextyear? Either qualitative or quantitative? It’s been up pretty good that lastcouple of years. Do we thinkabout that trend continuing?
W. Rodney McMullen: In terms ofspecific numbers, we would do that when wegive our fourth quarter. But in terms ofintent and where we would spend the money Ithink you’ll see us continuewith a heavyemphasis on remodels and expansions would be the biggest key focus point.You’ll also see us continueto aggressively spend on logistics and technology.
Ed Kelly – Credit Suisse: Okay. Great.Thank you.
David B. Dillon: Thank you.And in wrapping uplet me offer theseclosing comments. Before we sign off I wanted to share a few thoughtswith the associateslistening in today. In our businessthe holidays are obviously a veryexciting time of year. Our stores look great, our plants and distributioncentres and offices are runningwell. As we all worktogether to create special experiences for our customers it just is a great timeof year.  This seasonoffers each of us a chance toreflect. Just before Thanksgiving I had the opportunityto visit our store in Greensburg,Kansas. You may recall that this past summer a tornadodevastated that community and we lost both the small Dillonstore and a Quickshopconvenience store. As the town wentabout the difficulttask of rebuilding, associates from Dillons worked together with a group of ourassociates from our convenience stores to come up with a solutionthat works for Greensburg. Today that community is served by a combinationstore; one that is a DillonsQuickshop, which meets the dailygrocery and household needs of Greensburg residents and provides the communitywith a much neededfuel centre and other conveniences the Quickshopoffers.  During myvisit I spoke with associates who are so proud, they are so proud ofserving the community.And I listen to customers who are so grateful tohave a store thatmeets their needs. It was a clearreminder to count our blessings every day. I’m thankful to count each of you,our associates, among mine.  Thank you forall you do for ourcustomers and each other every day. Have fun this holiday season and take timeto celebrate with your friends and your family.  Thank you all for joiningus today, Merry Christmas, and Happy Holidays.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2007 Kroger Company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Carin Fike, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
 Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material affect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our web site at www.kroger.com. Now I would like to introduce Mr. David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
 David Dillon: Thank you, Carin and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's second quarter 2007 financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I'll begin with the recap of Kroger's second quarter and year-to-date results. I will also update our guidance for 2007 and Rodney will then provide additional details on Kroger's second quarter results. After that, we'll be happy to take your questions.  Kroger delivered another quarter of strong sales performance. Total sales for the second quarter increased 6.6% to $16.1 billion and identical supermarket sales increased 5.8% with fuel and 5.1% without fuel. This is the ninth consecutive quarter Kroger has reported identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, in excess of 3%. Our strong identical sales growth continues to be broad-based across the company's geographic regions and merchandise departments. All of our divisions and departments experienced positive identical sales growth. In addition, our convenience stores turned in another strong quarter of identical sales growth.  Net earnings in the second quarter totaled $267.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $209 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Our fuel business had a strong second quarter this year in sales, gallons and margin. While fuel margins for the quarter were strong, on a year-to-date basis they were more normalized. In the fuel business, it is not uncommon to see variations from quarter to quarter. To account for these fluctuations, we encourage investors to considering a longer view when analyzing fuel margins.  We are very pleased with our results this quarter. Our associates understand the importance of placing our customers first in their daily decisions. These results show we are connecting with our diverse customer base in a variety of ways including service, price and products.  Turning to year-to-date results, total sales increased 6.7% to $36.9 billion during the first two quarters of fiscal 2007. For the same period, identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased 5.1%. For the first two quarters of fiscal 2007, net earnings were $603.8 million or $0.85 per diluted share. Net earnings for the same period in fiscal 2006 were $515.4 million or $0.71 per diluted share.  Kroger's earnings per share growth in fiscal 2007 will be driven by strong identical sales growth, a slightly improving operating margin, and fewer shares outstanding. Our performance through the first half of 2007 exceeding our expectations and our momentum heading into the second half of the year causes us to raise our identical sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2007. Kroger now anticipates identical supermarket sales growth of 4% to 5% for the full year, excluding fuel sales.  We expect to earn $1.64 to $1.67 per diluted share in fiscal 2007, up from the previous range of $1.60 to $1.65 per diluted share. Our updated guidance equates to 12% to 14% growth from adjusted fiscal 2006 earnings of $1.47 per diluted share. In addition, Kroger's dividend currently adds slightly over 1% to shareholder return.  As we mentioned at the onset of fiscal 2007, we expected the timing of certain items in 2006 would affect our quarterly earnings per share growth in 2007. We anticipated that our earnings per share growth rates in the first and fourth quarters would be lower than the second and third quarters. This has held true for the first half of 2007 and we believe it fairly describes our expectations for the second half of the year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 benefited from an extra week that we believe added approximately $0.07 per share to our results.  Looking beyond 2007, we believe our Customer First strategy will allow us to grow identical supermarket sales in the 3% to 5% range, with slightly improving operating margins, excluding fuels sales.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Rodney for some additional details on our second quarter results. 
 Rodney McMullen:  Thank you, Dave and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we are very pleased with Kroger's results this quarter and we are inline with our expectations that the Company's EPS growth rate for the second quarter would be higher than the growth rate for the full fiscal year.  I'll now discuss some of the income statement components that produced our earnings per share growth in the quarter. Let's begin with gross margin. Kroger's second quarter FIFO gross margin increased 47 basis points to 23.94% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin increased 51 basis points from the prior year. Of this increase, 23 basis points was attributable to lower shrink, lower distribution costs and advertising expense as a rate of sales. FIFO gross margin increase also reflects our decision to pass along higher product costs during the quarter.  Inflation is on many people's minds these days, so we'll take a minute to comment on how inflation is affecting Kroger's business. You may recall that we also experienced inflationary pressures across several product categories in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. At that time, we made a strategic decision not to immediately pass along all of our product cost inflation in retail prices based on specific market conditions. Second quarter market conditions allowed for a general pass-through of cost increases.  Kroger's supermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales rose 38 basis points during the second quarter. This increase primarily reflects our decision to pass along product cost increases. On a year-to-date basis, Kroger's selling gross margin excluding fuel declined 11 basis points. This slight decline illustrates the timing factor associated with product cost inflation and our retail prices in our business as well as Kroger's continued practice of strategic price investments.  Delivering value to our customers remains an important part of Kroger's Customer First strategy. We estimate that our product cost inflation during the quarter was 2.6%. This figure excludes fuel and utilizes CPI to estimate our inflation for our pharmacy department. We are experiencing inflation across many core grocery and perishable categories. Inflation in core grocery is at a level not seen in several years.  The current inflationary environment has caused us to increase the projected LIFO charge in our business plan for fiscal 2007. We now anticipate a LIFO charge of approximately $110 million for the full year. This is $60 million more than the projection embedded in our original earnings per share guidance for 2007. The updated EPS guidance that Dave outlined earlier incorporates the $110 million LIFO charge.  Turning now to OG&A, operating, general and administrative increased 2 basis points to 17.52% of sales. Excluding the affect of retail fuel operations, OG&A increased 16 basis points. This fluctuation may appear unusual to those of you who understand the business model that supports Kroger's Customer First strategy so I'm going to provide additional color on what caused our OG&A rate to increase compared to the prior year.  Kroger's second quarter OG&A rate in the current year includes pre-opening and transition costs associated with the Scott's and Farmer Jack acquisitions that we described to you during our first quarter earnings call. We closed on these transactions during the second quarter. There are obviously no comparable costs in the prior year's OG&A rate. Kroger's second quarter OG&A rate in both fiscal 2007 and 2006 benefited from adjustments that reduced our closed-store lease liability. The magnitude of this benefit was higher in 2006 than 2007. These adjustments are part of our normal quarterly assessment of lease commitments.  Excluding these items, Kroger's second quarter OG&A rate on non-fuel sales would have been lower in 2007 when compared to the prior year. This is in-line with our business model objective. Compared to the prior year, we continue to expect our annual OG&A rate in fiscal 2007, excluding fuel, to decline as a rate of sales.  The gross margin and OG&A factors I just discussed, plus approximately 9 basis points of leverage from rent expense, resulted in a slight expansion of Kroger's non-fuel operating margin for the second quarter. While Kroger's second quarter operating margin is consistent with our plan, we do not believe that a single quarter's operating margin is the best gauge of success of our business strategy. This is due to the timing of operational cost savings and investments in our business.  Kroger's operating margin on a year-to-date basis increased 5 basis points, excluding fuel and the first quarter charges for labor unrest in 2007 and certain legal expenses in 2006. For the full year fiscal 2007, we continue to anticipate a slight increase in Kroger's non-fuel operating margin, which is one of the drivers of our annual earnings per share growth.  Kroger's earnings per share growth in fiscal 2007 is also driven by fewer shares outstanding. We aggressively bought back shares during the second quarter, reflecting our judgment that Kroger shares represent a compelling investment. Under our stock repurchase program, Kroger repurchased 21.2 million shares of stock in the second quarter at an average price of $27.21 for a total investment of $587 million. At the end of the quarter, $612 million remained under our $1 billion stock repurchase program we announced in June 2007.  As we told you last quarter, the financial strategy that supports Kroger's business has evolved to reflect our progress in reducing Kroger's leverage over the past few years. Our long-term financial strategy is to use free cash flow to repurchase shares and pay dividends while maintaining a solid investment grade rating. Our share repurchase and dividend programs deliver substantial value to shareholders. Over the past four quarters, Kroger has returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends.  Net total debt was $6.7 billion, an increase of $362 million from a year ago. Total debt was $6.7 million, a reduction of $274 million from a year ago. You may recall last year Kroger had approximately $600 million of cash invested on our balance sheet in investments, which caused the total debt and net debt to be different a year ago.  Kroger's net total debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.77 this quarter compared to 1.87 during the same period last year. Our strong EBITDA on a rolling four-quarter basis enabled us to improve our leverage ratio while investing $2 billion in capital projects and $1 billion to repurchase 40.7 million shares and pay $192 million in dividends.  During the second quarter, Kroger invested $566 million in capital projects, including acquisitions. This includes the acquisition of 37 stores in northeast Indiana and metropolitan Detroit that I referenced earlier. We invested $85.5 million to acquire these stores. Excluding acquisitions, Kroger invested $481 million compared to $361 million a year ago. Total capital projects included 13 new or expanded stores and 30 remodels. During the quarter, we also closed 11 locations; all of these were operational closures.  During the quarter, total supermarket square footage grew 1.6% year over year, excluding acquisitions and operational closings. We continue to anticipate supermarket square footage growth of 2% in fiscal 2007. We still expect to invest $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in capital projects during fiscal 2007. This estimate excludes spending on acquisitions.  In terms of capital allocation, our emphasis remains on store remodels and we are very satisfied with their performance. We have completed 101 remodels year-to-date through the end of the second quarter. That compares to 73 remodels during the same period last year. Kroger carefully evaluates acquisition opportunities for their potential to enhance shareholder value along with our existing business. We also focus on improving our return on capital investment. Our return on assets improved 85 basis points on a pretax basis, excluding the effect of the 53rd week in fiscal 2006. This is on the same basis that Kroger has consistently used to calculate return on assets.  Before turning back to Dave, I'll discuss the progress we have made in labor relations. We recently reached agreements with unions representing our associates in southern California, Seattle and Toledo. We are currently in negotiations in Cincinnati, Memphis, West Virginia, and in southern California with Food4Less. In every contract negotiation, we work to reach a balanced agreement that meets our cost efficiency objectives while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. Maintaining this balance allows Kroger to invest in our business to provide great new job opportunities for existing associates and create new jobs for more people. Fair and balanced contract settlements continue to be our objective in all negotiations.  Now I'll turn it back over to Dave for some closing remarks. 
 David Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. We made solid progress during the second quarter in achieving our business objectives for the year. We are on track to successfully execute our business plan and generate value for our shareholders. In addition to the factors we just described, I want to update you on progress we've made during the quarter on one of our key competitive strengths, corporate brands.  Our corporate brands team recently launched an expanded line of private label organic products under Kroger's exclusive Private Selections brand. Organic and natural foods continues to be a growing area of our business and with this expansion, Kroger's family of stores now carries more than 60 Private Selection organic products. Items range from staples such as milk, ketchup, butter and eggs to new items like cereal, salads and snacks. These Private Selection organic products are integrated throughout our stores and are available on shelves right next to our customers' favorite products. This makes it easy for customers who want to try organic foods to do so at their own pace without having to go to a special section for the organic items they want. We're excited to expand this growing segment of our business.  Now we'd like to take a few minutes to answer your questions. 
Operator: Your first question comes from Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: On the gross margins, I just want to make sure we understand the impact of passing along the higher product costs. Do you see this as essentially a one-time catch-up from Q1, or should we expect margins to be impacted for the rest of the year? 
 David Dillon: Perry, we were trying to demonstrate by illustrating the year-to-date picture that you ought to look at Q1 and Q2 together in this regard and actually in operating profit too. One of the reasons we did is that we identified in the first quarter that as inflation occurs, depending on the items that it happens in and depending on the market conditions, it may or may not get passed through at that particular moment in time. You may as a result see some unusual fluctuations in margins at different times because of that. As a result, I think you could continue to see that same kind of a picture down the road depending on what happens with inflation and then what items occurs and what the market conditions are.  Mostly what we're trying to do is make sure you understand not to expect growing gross margins and instead to look back at what our overall strategy is. Our overall strategy is to grow identical sales and have a slightly improving operating margin. That requires actually, in our opinion, that we continue to invest in each of the four keys -- not just price -- but each of the four keys on those areas where we find savings. That's the overall picture and theme that we want to make sure you take away from this call. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Do you have any picture on how the next two or three quarters might unfold on the inflation front? 
 David Dillon:  Well, the one piece of information I can give you is that based on what we know today, the third quarter looks like it will be similar to where we have been in the second quarter in terms of product cost increases. We can't speculate at this point on the gross margins as would be reflected in retail pricing, but I can tell you that based on what we've seen on product costs, that those look like they'll continue into the third quarter pretty similar to what we saw in the previous quarter.  Now, that statement is in primarily dry grocery. It would not include perishables. Those are a little more unpredictable. I don't know that we have enough vision into what's happening with milk further out than a month or so to be able to comment there either. 
 Rodney McMullen:  Perry, if you look at our LIFO estimate, our LIFO estimate would assume that third and fourth quarter would look pretty similar to where we are year-to-date.  One other thing to Dave's answer to the first question, as you know, when you look at gross, we also have expenses in gross. When we look at the expenses in gross, we would expect to have continued opportunity to improve those numbers. I don't know that we would normally improve as much as we did this quarter, but we do see opportunities to continue to improve on those three lines. 
 David Dillon:  On that point, we actually think of expenses, not just OG&A, as a total group of costs and we include in there those three expenses that are embedded in the gross that Rodney described: shrink and the logistics cost and advertising. So that's a really good additional point. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: On a related question then, what did passing on inflated product costs do to your price competitiveness? In other words, how were you able to get prices up and still drive sales? 
 David Dillon: We're pleased with our price competitiveness. As you know, that's a pretty strong focal point of the organization. Every market's different, so it's hard to broad brush what that position is, but we are pleased with that competitiveness. I think that the reason our sales have been able to grow has been overall all of the parts of the strategy, it's not any one thing. It's all departments contributing, it's all divisions contributing. It is the strategy we described of investing in those four areas that we think matter to the customer with the savings that we get.  Certainly, inflation in the quarter caused or helped our ideas to be slightly more positive in the quarter than think otherwise would have been. There's no doubt about that. I think our strategy and the work we're doing on many fronts is the reason the sales are where they are. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A terrific quarter. A couple of things. Number one, you talked about market conditions maybe being a little more favorable in the second quarter. Was the competitive environment or the promotional environment a little less intense? Is that what you were referring to? Related to that, what was your level of, on a relative basis, magnitude of your price investment second quarter versus first? Were they substantially less or modestly less or how would you define that? 
 Rodney McMullen: Well on the market conditions, from a competitive point of view, I don’t think that the conditions really changed much. I think probably if I were to try to guess the reasons we saw a difference in what you are asking about is that the whole market was paying higher costs on products and as a result, competitors chose to raise some of their retail prices on selected items, based on this cost. That took a little bit of the heat off of individual items that may have kept us in the past from being able to pass through a cost increase, again, depending on the items. Some items like milk varies every week. But other items, it wouldn’t be as competitive. Once those get passed through to the market then it is certainly back to the competitive conditions it was before, even though we passed through a price increase. So that’s really what was happening there.  The other question you asked was? 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: The proactive strategic price investments seem to be a bit less in the second quarter than the first. A general sense of magnitude of how much less? 
 Rodney McMullen: Price investment in the quarter, I don’t think we are quantifying it, but it is pretty clear just purely based on what happened with the gross margins, that there would have been less strategic investment in the quarter than in the previous quarter. Certainly less new initiatives and less new pricing strategies would have been adopted, and that is reflected in what happened with the margins.  Part of the reason for that is with the inflation and competitive conditions, we wanted to make sure that we were on a solid basis on where we were both in our pricing on our previous strategies and then our competitiveness on the items that had cost increases. So we concentrated a lot of energy on that. Plus, as you can see on the items embedded in gross, we had good success in reducing the cost in those three areas. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Secondly, you guys have pretty good loyalty card data. If you look at where you're getting your comp store growth from, you have a couple of buckets here: the primary shoppers buying more, secondary maybe transitioning more to primary; and then maybe a third bucket being totally new customers. Is the bulk of it coming from primary spending more share, or are you picking up in the other two areas as well? 
 David Dillon: I'll see if Rodney has anymore current data than I had, but my impression is that it's much like we described last quarter. That our improved business is coming from our best customers shopping more with us and customers who previously weren't shopping as much with us becoming more of a best customer for us. So it's really all of the things you described. It's not just one area or another. 
 Rodney McMullen: Slightly over half of it would be growth from an existing customer spending more with us in terms of overall. But you always have new customers coming in and customers moving. So it's always a constant flow. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: So slightly less than half, then, would be new customers. 
 Rodney McMullen: Right. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Husson - HSBC. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC: We've been looking at these numbers and noticed a couple of things. The first thing was, they weren't too bad, were they? 
 David Dillon:  Well, thank you. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC:  The second thing was, if you look back, and I went back through the models to have a look and see the last time you had a gross margin increase, because it's a bit rare, and it was about five years ago, actually the first quarter in 2002. Also in that period of time, you've managed to lose about 350 basis points of gross margin and lost about 150 basis points of SG&A.  Now I think you anticipated a long journey in terms of rebuilding and rebasing the P&L account, but being as we have now seen your guidance is 165, well, includes 165, which was about what you made five years ago, finally, so while these numbers aren't very good, it's five years since you made the same number. Has that journey ended, or how is it changing? It seems unlikely you're going to lose another 350 basis points over the next five years. 
 David Dillon:  Well, I'm glad you noticed the milestone that we're reaching. We appreciate that insight. It is a long journey. I don't view this as the end of that journey. I view it as actually we're in the second half of it. But that's actually because it's almost like the cost opportunities of saving money and the cost savings that we see, when you get to the top of the peak, you look out ahead and see another mountain peak higher than the last one, you say, whoa, what at an opportunity. Every step of the way we've gone in this strategy, we've seen not only improved results, but additional opportunities.  So whether or not the additional investments we will make will be in price or will instead be in shopping experience or people or products or some combination of those four, I'm not sure I want to predict that just yet. But I will predict that as we continue to save OG&A, which we expect we can and can save additional money in the expenses embedded in gross, that we will choose to reinvest much of that in ways that will help our customers continue to shop more with us, growing our sales, and therefore growing the earnings.  We are recognizing and do expect to have our operating margins grow slightly and that's intended to say our thought here is to not cause our bottom line to decrease like it has done, as you pointed out, for several years from our peak. We plan instead to have it grow from here. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC: The things that have changed since then, clearly, the fresh departments are a much bigger part of your business than they were then and general merchandise is a significant change. Just talk about general merchandise here. You have not mentioned it very much as you start to roll out the Marketplace stores and whether or not high gas prices have caused people to sort of consolidate shopping trips and whether those stores are beginning to get discount customers into your stores. 
 David Dillon:  I'll come right back to that. Rodney was going to add a point to that. 
 Rodney McMullen: If you look at our identical sales trend, as everyone understands, our model is driven by identical sales growth and clearly our identical sales growth is on a completely different trajectory today than it was five years ago.  The other point, Mark, using your numbers, if I wrote them down properly, was the 350-basis point margin investment and a 150-basis point reduction in OG&A. I don't think we would point to either one of those and give a specific direction. Rather, we would not expect you to see a net 200-basis point decline between those two versus what David said, a slight expansion in our operating margin, and that's what's really more important than the absolute change in any one of those two numbers over time. 
 David Dillon: That's very true. Good point. Mark, back to your second point, an update on general merchandise and what do we see as the effect on the consuming public of high gas prices? Is that the gist of it? 
 Mark Husson - HSBC:  Yes and traffic patterns. 
 David Dillon:  We're of course very pleased at the progress we've made with the Marketplace stores. We've now opened the first Marketplace store in Wichita, Kansas, which is the latest that has been opened. We continue to be pleased with the results and have made plans to grow that format. That format actually has a number of attributes, one of which is general merchandise, of course, and the general merchandise sales in those facilities is good and is growing and we think over the long haul will become an important part of that format.  But in addition to general merchandise, the newer Marketplace stores that we've built actually are growing the food side of the business as well. The fresh offering in these stores is quite remarkable and we're very pleased at those results also.  Now as to the effect of gas prices on the consuming public, that would be a bit of speculation on our part. Obviously, gas prices are high and if you go back to four or five years ago, the customer's having to spend a lot more for fuel than they did before. While I don't know that we have any actual data that will prove this, we do believe that we benefit somewhat from this because the size of our stores is such that we are generally located within a couple of miles of customer's homes, they don't have to drive a long way to come visit us. And in the Marketplace stores too, we have a large customer base in the nearby vicinity of the store, and so we see those stores as actually pretty convenient. We actually see the combo store or the Marketplace store, either one, as providing good, one-stop shopping so the customers can consolidate their trips that way. Not to mention the fact that we have fuel at many of our supermarkets now and typically we are priced low in the market and typically customers can earn lower prices on their gas bill by shopping with us. The combination of all of those, I think, makes us as a pretty good spot to come in this environment of high fuel costs. 
 Rodney McMullen:  And it's very clear our associates are doing a much better job of providing the shopping experience for our customers that the customer wants and I think that is overlaid on all of Dave's comments. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: I have a bunch of questions that kind of follow on what people have said. I would like to just start with the last thing you said, that customers are pleased with changes you've made in your business, outside of just price. At your analyst meeting last year, you actually put up a slide and showed customers' view of those four keys.  Could you just update us a little bit? I think you've said you're happy with price, but what about everything else. Are you seeing customers report back to you improvement? 
 David Dillon:  We continue to improve, but if you would ask us internally, we're not making as much progress as we would like and it's certainly one of those half full or half empty. The positive is we continue to improve, but we want to improve even more. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Then sort of following on this conversation with Mark, do you see the potential ever to get back the 200 basis points of operating margin that you lost? Is that not something you're even thinking about? I know you want to drive sales, but is it reasonable to believe that? 
 David Dillon:  We really are focused on the combinations of sales and what then happens with our operating margin and the slight improvements that we're seeking. It's my personal opinion that if we were to make a drastic change in the near term in operating margins that we would soon see the sales gains that we had get dissipated and the combination of our strategy would not really work after that.  So you should not expect anything in the short run that would cause that to be significantly different. I don't think I want to speculate on margins in the long run. Our focus really is on the strategy as we've described it and it certainly leads to slightly higher margins and year after year that margin would continue to grow that way. So sure, it could get bright bigger than it is today. I just don't know how much bigger that would look. 
 Rodney McMullen: If you look at the returns on where we are currently, it's in excess of our cost of capital by a nice margin. If you look at our business model on continuing slightly improving operating margins, we would expect for that to continue to be true. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Then just a little bit more technical question. I want to make sure I understand what you said about the one-time costs that was in OG&A this quarter. If we look at the 2 basis points of increase in OG&A, if you backed out the things that probably would be considered one-time or the comparison on the store closing cost versus last year, would that have gotten you to something minus 18 basis points? Am I understanding what you said right? 
 Rodney McMullen:  If you look at it without fuel, it would have been an increase of 16 basis points. If you adjust out the start-up costs and transition costs for Scott's and Farmer Jack acquisition and the adjustments on the closed stores, that would have been a decline in OG&A rather than an increase of 16 basis points. So it would have been a negative, if you want to look at it that way. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  And then more significantly negative if you include fuel? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Yes. But we always exclude fuel because the OG&A on that business is extremely low. We just think it's always important to show it without the effect of fuel because it just affects the whole number so much that we think that in trying to be more transparent for people to understand our numbers, that's the reason we exclude it. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Just one technical question. Could you tell us what square footage growth was if you include the acquisitions and the operational closings? I know why you provide the other number, but in the end the question I'm asking is probably what's driving the business, is the total growth. 
 Rodney McMullen:  If you have another question, we're looking it up, so it will take a couple of seconds. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: I did want to ask you just a question about the dividend. You obviously have a choice between buying back stock and increasing your dividend. Any chances you're going to increase the dividend? 
 David Dillon:  The last statement on the dividend that we made, and I would go back to that, and I think that was probably in March. 
 Rodney McMullen:  March, when we announced the increase. 
 David Dillon:  Yes, when we announced the increase that it is the board's intention to review this roughly each year with the desire to, if the conditions are right, with the desire to have an increase in dividend. That policy is what we stated then. That's as far as actually we go on that subject. I don't think I can say anything more current than that. But that view is essentially to say that we want to look at the dividend each year and ask ourselves what's the best choice here on dividends and I'm sure our board will consider the point you're making at the time they evaluate that again this next year. 
 Rodney McMullen:  Meredith, it's actually 1.9, so it's higher when you include everything because of the affect of the Scott's and Farmer Jack acquisitions in the quarter. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick - Banc of America. 
 Todd Duvick - Banc of America:  Good morning and congratulations. I was wanting to know if you can tell me about the share buyback program? On a full-year basis, do you plan to buy back the shares strictly with cash flow, or are you also considering funding the program partly with debt? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Our long-term strategy is to fund our share buyback and dividend with free cash flow and manage our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to a level that will allow us to be a solid investment grade rating.  As the enterprise expands and EBITDA continues to grow, you can see what we spent over the rolling four quarters on capital, which is why we talked about those. We spent $2 billion in capital and then bought in the level of stock we did over the rolling four quarters as well as paying the dividend. We spent quite a bit of dollars and we're still able to reduce net total debt and improve our leverage ratio.  My expectation would be that you would continue to see that kind of activity happen. Debt at some point, as the enterprise continues to grow and EBITDA continues to grow, we need to balance the amount of debt as compared to the amount of equity on our balance sheet to make sure we have the right balance. But we will remain focused on our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to manage that to a very solid investment grade. 
 Todd Duvick - Banc of America: So I take from that that as we look at the debt balance going forward, generally we should expect debt to grow inline with cash flow? 
 Rodney McMullen:  I wouldn't predict a particular number, but we will manage the net total debt to EBITDA ratio to be a solid investment grade. In our view, that's at least mid-triple B.  Very pleased to have spent, in the rolling four quarters, basically $3.2 billion and still have a 10-basis point reduction or a 0.1 decline in our leverage ratio. That demonstrates the amount of cash flow generation that we have. 
 Todd Duvick - Banc of America: A question coming from a different angle. Can you talk about geographically, are there any markets that you're seeing that are either exceptionally strong or some markets where you're actually seeing some increased competitive pressures? Can you provide us any color along those lines? 
 David Dillon:  We certainly are seeing some markets that are noticeably better than others, and we are seeing some markets that are more competitive than others. For competitive reasons, though, we choose typically not to disclose that. As a result, I apologize for not answering your question, but I'm not going to. 
 Rodney McMullen:  And it's not specific competitors, either. 
 David Dillon:  There's not a clear pattern in that regard. It's really more localized. 
 Rodney McMullen:  But it's really no different than what we would have seen over the last two or three years. 
 David Dillon:  Yes. 
 Rodney McMullen:  It's why we often talk about our geographic diversity being one of our biggest strengths. You always have markets that are pretty darn competitive, you have some markets that are probably on the other side of that competitive cycle, and then the rest fall somewhere in the middle, close to either end of that, and that's why we think our geographic diversity and our spread across the country helps balance the affect on the total company. It gives us the ability to address the competitive situations when we need to. 
 David Dillon: That's also the reason why, if you look, all our region, we were positive identicals and that was one of the comments. That's an important thing to note, at least it's important to me to note that all the divisions were positive IDs because that's a real important indication of how we're doing. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities:  Just one cleanup item to start with. You mentioned when you're discussing the gross profit margin, Rodney, you talked about a 38-basis point item and I sort of lost what that was? 
 Rodney McMullen: Let me go back and make sure I quote exactly right. It was supermarket selling gross. 
 David Dillon:  Yes, the supermarket selling gross in the quarter was up 38 basis points. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities: If we're looking now at these acquired store, the 37 you just bought, can you tell us where they're at in terms of getting them fixed up, how many are open, and when the rest will reopen, that sort of thing? 
 David Dillon:  All are reopened except for one store that we plan to reopen. The one store that we didn't reopen, we will do a major remodel in that store and we just didn't think it made much sense to open it, because the remodel is going to be so major. They're all converted to Kroger systems and all of those behind the scenes things. Now we're going through the process of actually remodeling the stores and that will take two or three years to get through all of them in terms of remodeling the stores to the way we like. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities:  And those will be more basic remodels? 
 David Dillon:  It will be everything from basic to some will be pretty serious. It's a pretty wide range and if you look on both of these, we were especially pleased with some of these sites and we will make sure that we remodel these stores right, because we think the opportunity is pretty big in terms of improving the business. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities:  Okay. So you bought 37, 36 are open? 
 David Dillon: Well there's five stores that we either closed their store or closed a Kroger store to consolidate the business between the two. So it would be 31. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities: How's the acquisition environment looking, Rodney? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Right now it's a little bit quieter than it has been. I think part of it's probably anyone's that's selling, the valuation at the moment they probably don't like it very much. It's a little quieter than it's been recently, but it's one of those things where it will be quiet for two or three months and then all of a sudden you'll get three or four in a week. So it always goes in cycles. But it's quiet at the moment. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities: Dave, can you please talk about prepared foods during the quarter? It looks like based on what I've seen in the stores, an improving category for you. How did it behave and how do you fit that into what the consumer's facing in other parts of their budget, especially fuel and maybe housing costs? 
 David Dillon: Most of our prepared foods would fall in the deli department. I don't know that all of it would, but most of it would. Our deli for the quarter had a very good sales result. They're IDs were better than our company average and we're very pleased with what they did. We are trying a variety of different things in different stores and we're trying to learn as we go and modify that program as we go. So generally we're pleased with the direction, pleased with the progress, but we believe we also have some areas of improvement in that area that we could make. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin - Banc of America. 
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: I just wanted to kind of pick on the issue of going back to the gross margins, but also a comment you made that there was a little less price investment during the quarter. Vis-à-vis clearly Wal-Mart, a big competitor of you guys have been vocal in the other direction. With the second quarter it seems like Wal-Mart, they did it in October, it didn't have an affect. They started doing this again in June, maybe even on a bigger basis. Are you just not seeing any impact from their actions, or they're thinking that the consumer's in a different place? Are you seeing any consumer reaction to what seems to be a more difficult economic macro economic environment? 
 David Dillon:  Scott, I look at lots of different competitors and certainly Wal-Mart is one of them. I'm pleased with, actually, our price competitiveness as to Wal-Mart on a relative basis compared to where we've been over time. I don't think that we've let that position deteriorate. On the other hand, we have similar questions on other competitors too, as to how we're faring those and we watch those pretty closely. Overall our price position, we are generally pleased with it.  I've said before and I think it's still true that there are plenty of opportunities to improve on that position, but relatively speaking from whence we came several years ago, we've really improved on that situation. I don't think that changed in the quarter, because really the costs that we described in our inflation were costs that many others, in fact everybody else, would have experienced too. So they would have had to figure out what they would do with their own pricing and in their own situations. 
 Rodney McMullen:  And also, some of their price investments or comments are on categories where we don't carry the items, too. Certainly, when you look at back-to-school, there's a lot of categories that we would not carry. 
 David Dillon:  That would be true. As to whether or not we're getting business from Wal-Mart or not, I'm really not going to speculate on that. I think one of the key messages for us is this is about Kroger's strategy. We're pursuing our strategy and it's having a good success and we'll take customers wherever we find them. And it may be some from Wal-Mart, but may also be some from traditional grocers, some from independent, some from other chains, some that were actually getting from restaurants.  We didn't really talk much about that change, but it's reasonably clear, I think, in the data in the restaurant industry that the trend towards eating out more often, at least the rate of growth of that, has subsided some. Now whether that's because of costs and people just know that it's less expensive to eat at home, that's certainly one reason and I know it's true and I'm sure some people react to that.  In addition to that, we've commented before about the trend towards families eating together. Of course, some of the families eating together maybe to reduce the cost, but it also may be because of the findings we've talked about before at the Columbia University that families that eat together on a regular basis have all kinds of good things happen with regard to their kids growing up.  There's more on that. In fact, Family Day is coming up later this month. I don't remember the exact date, but it's later this month and you'll see a lot of advertising around that to encourage families to think about that. I think that is something that's going on in society today and I think it works certainly to our advantage, but more importantly it works to the advantage of the families. 
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: Just for what it's worth, our pricing survey with Wal-Mart are showing gaps widening again, for what it's worth. The second question I had was regarding growth, and I think it goes back to a question Mark was asking or looking at it historically. Historically you guys, if I go back in my model, it looks like you used to grow square footage net of about 4%. As we look out to '08, '09, and look to maybe transition from the value story, are there opportunities to grow organically or do you still favor the acquisition fill-in? 
 Rodney McMullen:  At this point, our preferred method, obviously, is growing identical sales. Because we've had great success in that and we think when you look across the enterprise, we still have a lot of capacity to grow identical sales even better than where we are and then some of the slightly improving margins and buying back stock. You'll see us over time to continue being a little bit more aggressive, but it will be more in terms of replacing good stores with Marketplace stores will really drive the organic growth. To go into new markets, you probably won't see too much of that unless it's finding the right company to merge with. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup. 
Ken for Debra Weinswig - Citigroup: Congrats on the impressive quarter. My question relates to your Kroger personal finance initiative. We noticed that you guys have added a few more products on your website. Can you give us an update on that strategy and how has that impacted traffic or just the overall results? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Overall, we're very pleased with where we are in Kroger personal finance. As you know, we have a partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland and it's working out great for us. When you look at the business model overall it continues to develop where we expected if not better than what we originally expected. Our customers continue to reward us with more and more loyalty on some of the products. So overall we're very pleased with where we are and we are very pleased with where we see it going and it really is just one more thing to eliminate another stop for the customer to make it easy for them. We have some great products at very good values for the customer. 
Ken for Debra Weinswig - Citigroup: As far as the financial contribution to your earnings, can we expect that to be significant five years from now, or is this more for traffic building? 
 Rodney McMullen:  It certainly has the opportunity if you look five years out, to be something that would be willing to talk about, but we're looking at it one step at a time. 
Ken for Debra Weinswig - Citigroup: My last question is related to your in-store clinic strategy. Can you give us an update on how that's going? 
 Rodney McMullen: Currently, we have in-store clinics, I believe, in 30-some stores. We've partnered with several different companies on our in-store clinic strategy. So far, the customers seem to like it and it continues to grow, but the growth is reasonably slow. But we continue to look at it and look at how it will become part of our overall pharmacy strategy and try to understand how to make it a more important piece. It's still pretty early in the process, but it's something we are spending some energy on trying to understand and look at in a little bit more serious way. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets. 
 Rodney McMullen:  Andrew, this will be our last question, I think. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: I've got two for you and congrats on the momentum. Do you give out or can you give out the change in penny profit per gallon at your fuel stations? I think you mentioned you had a good quarter there in profits. 
 Rodney McMullen:  We do not and we always think it's more important to look at it over a longer period of time than quarter-to-quarter, but we do not give out the specifics. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  The other question regards inflation crept up from 2% in the first quarter and whatever it was last year, looks like it was running around 1%. You're passing through more of it and sales are very impressive, but they're on a nominal basis at about the same number, 5% plus comp. So that implies either your tonnage or volume is sort of decreasing or there's some trading down, which I guess you would expect in this environment.  In lieu of that, if you agree to that kind of logic, would you discuss trends in tonnage and in trading down? 
 David Dillon: Well, the trading down is hard to track, at least in a very precise way. Certainly, we believe some of that would occur. People trading to a lower priced product, buy more Kroger brand, which certainly has been true in the quarter. Whether that's driven by inflation or driven by national brands raising prices, it's hard to say. But to that extent, we certainly believe the customers will tend to shift as they need to shift, but they also will shift, as I mentioned earlier from restaurant business to our business. So that works to our advantage in that regard.  Tonnage also, while it may seem at first easy to track, it's sometimes hard to track and as a result, we don't have real confidence in the actual numbers. We do track it, but I don't have confidence enough in them to be publishing the numbers. We look at the trends because we want to understand really what's happening with our business. I think we'll stick with the statement that I made earlier that it's certainly clear that our quarter identical sales in the second quarter were more positive as a result of inflation than they would have otherwise been. There's certainly some impact there. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: In a typical trading down situation, let's say from an inflating brand to a Kroger brand, can you just kind of discuss how the profitability on a penny profit per unit compares, in a Kroger brand versus a national brand? 
 David Dillon:  Generally speaking, we make a higher percentage margin on Kroger brand products and while not always, we often make a higher finished profit too. Although sometimes the price difference is significant enough that at the higher percentage margin, the finished profit is still not any higher. But overall my objective as a pricer, as I think about pricing strategy is, I like to make more pennies a unit sold in a Kroger brand product than in a national brand product. I think that works well for us and it works well for the customer as they trade. So that's how, when I'm looking at pricing, that's how I'm always looking at it. 
 Rodney McMullen:  As you've header heard us say before, as a general rule, our margins about 10% higher on corporate brands than a national brand when you look at everything added together. As you know, one of the things our corporate brand team has been focused on is making our brands so good that our customers want to buy it, and it's not trading down to it, it's trading to it. 
 David Dillon: Or even trading up to it. On that point, we can all laugh a little bit about it, but I challenged our merchandise team, we do blind taste tests, you may know that. We do blind taste tests to determine if our product is viewed by the consuming public as good or better than the national brand. I said to the team a few years ago, we'll really be getting somewhere when it's not a blind taste test, that is when they see the results. We started doing those in the stores. And the results where we do that with customers that come by in the stores, and we have done thousands of them. When we do that, even when they know the brand, we are winning on the same basis that we were winning before when it was blind taste test. And that's actually quite remarkable. It is a little tongue-and-cheek to say they're trading up, but in fact they are trading up.  Anything else, Andrew? 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  That was it. Thank you. 
 David Dillon: Well, let me close with this. I want to thank you all for joining us, but before we sign off, I would like to offer some additional thoughts to our associates who we encouraged to listen in with us today.  As expected, 2007 is shaping up to be another successful year thanks to you. Many of us in senior management have had the opportunity in the last few weeks to visit many of you in stores or during visits to plants, distribution centers and offices and I always come home inspired by your enthusiasm and engagement with our customers.  I had another great experience this past weekend while visiting a store we recently expanded. During my visit, I was inspired by one gentleman who was spot cleaning the floor and proud of his work. Next I saw a cheese steward introducing new varieties of cheese to customers who have never tried them. Throughout my visit in the store, I saw numerous examples of talented associates engaging customers, from the creatively stocked salad bars to the wonderful prepared foods to the delicious pastry bar.

 David Dillon: Thanks, Carin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I will begin with a recap of Kroger's fourth quarter sales results; then I will provide market share information, along with sales and earnings guidance for 2007. Rodney will discuss Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 results and share additional detail on guidance. Then we'll be happy to take your questions.  Total sales for the fourth quarter increased 14.5% to $16.9 billion. After adjusting for the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2006, total sales increased 5.7% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Identical supermarket sales increased 5.6% with fuel and 5.3% without fuel, based on a 13-week period in both years. This is on top of very strong growth during the same period last year.  Our associates helped sustain the sales momentum we enjoyed leading into the holiday season by executing our plans well.  Growth this quarter was broad-based across all geographic regions and all departments. The strongest departments were grocery, drug GM, produce, nutrition, deli, bakery and pharmacy. In addition, our convenience stores turned in another strong quarter of sales growth, both in fuel gallons and in non-fuel merchandise.  Our strong fourth quarter results indicate once again that our associates understand the importance of offering customers improved service, product quality and selection, and value. Our company delivered yet another quarter of impressive identical sales growth, the key driver of our objective to increase earnings and create value for shareholders. Excluding fuel, this marks the 14th consecutive quarter Kroger has reported positive identical supermarket sales and the seventh consecutive quarter Kroger has reported identical supermarket sales in excess of 3%.  Our strong identical sales results throughout fiscal 2006 translated into a second consecutive year of impressive market share gains. It is our practice at this time of the year to describe our market share statistics to you. The market share figures we report are based on internal estimates. We determine the potential for sales in each of our markets from all retail outlets that sell merchandise comparable to our own, including supercenters and other non-traditional retail formats, such as dollar stores, drug stores and warehouse clubs. Many third party market share data providers only include some of these non-traditional formats.  Now for the detail of Kroger's 2006 market share statistics. We define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores. By this definition, Kroger's serves customers in 44 major markets. For 2006, Kroger held the number one or number two share position in 38 of our 44 major markets. Kroger's overall market share in these 44 markets rose approximately 65 basis points during 2006; that's on a volume-weighted basis. Our share increased in 36 of those 44 major markets, declined in seven, and remained unchanged in one.  Kroger competes against a total of 1,262 supercenters, an increase of 133 over last year. There are 34 major markets in which supercenters have achieved at least a number three market share position. Kroger's overall market share in these 34 markets rose over 70 basis points during 2006 on a volume-weighted basis. Our share increased in 27 of those 34 major markets, declined in six, and remained unchanged in one.  Of the 1,262 supercenters that I mentioned, 1,000 are operated by Wal-Mart. This is an increase of 125 over last year. Wal-Mart supercenters have achieved at least a number three share position in 32 of the major markets where Kroger faces significant supercenter competition. Kroger's overall market share in these 32 markets rose nearly 75 basis points during 2006 on a volume-weighted basis. Our share increased in 26 of these major markets, declined in five, and remained unchanged in one.  While these market share gains are dramatic on their own, we think they're even more impressive when you consider that they followed our strong market share gains in the previous year. In 2005, Kroger's overall market share in our 44 major markets increased more than 35 basis points. So when you look at the two years combined, our major market share increased approximately 100 basis points. Needless to say, this is huge.  Furthermore, our 2006 data indicates that Kroger continued to achieve significant growth in market share, even in the face of aggressive expansion by supercenters and other non-traditional formats. The pace of their expansion shows no sign of slowing down and the industry is not getting any less competitive.  Our business plan and customer-first strategy are built around this reality so that we can continue to grow, despite evolving and increasing competition. We challenged our associates to help us improve our connection with customers. They accepted the challenge and raised the bar, as these market share gains clearly show. Still, there is plenty of room for further growth. Even with Kroger's strong share in our 44 major markets, approximately 47% of the share in those markets continues to be held by competitors without our economies of scale. We estimate that their share has declined by about 3% over the last three years.  Now I will turn to our expectations for fiscal 2007. We're expecting another great year. Based on the momentum of our fiscal 2006 performance, Kroger anticipates earnings of $1.60 to $1.65 per diluted share in fiscal 2007. This equates to 9% to 12% growth from an adjusted fiscal 2006 earnings base of $1.47 per diluted share, as detailed on table 5 of our earnings release.  As in 2006, strong identical sales, slightly improving operating margins, and fewer shares outstanding will drive Kroger's earnings per share growth in fiscal 2007. This growth rate assumes a stable labor environment. We expect identical supermarket sales growth of 3% to 5% excluding fuel sales for fiscal 2007.  Kroger's quarterly cash dividend is an important component of shareholder return. We expect the combination of Kroger's dividend and the earnings per share target to deliver a double-digit return for Kroger shareholders in 2007. Later, Rodney will share some additional detail on our guidance for fiscal 2007. But first, he will discuss Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2006 results. 
Rodney McMullen:  Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Net earnings in the fourth quarter totaled $384.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. The current quarter benefited by $0.03 per diluted share from the adjustments of certain deferred tax balances; this was not contemplated in the company's prior guidance. Net earnings in the same period last year were $282.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share.  Kroger's fourth quarter results illustrate the successful execution of our strategy; that is, we are utilizing operating cost savings to fund improvements in value and service for our customers in order to drive strong identical sales growth that results in earnings growth for our shareholders.  Our gross margin and OG&A results reflect this strategy. During the quarter, FIFO gross margin declined 37 basis points to 24.48% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin declined 29 basis points from the prior year.  Our fourth quarter supermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 21 basis points, reflecting continued investment in lower prices for our customers. As you know, selling gross margin is a term we use internally to describe the company's gross margin before incurring expenses directly relating to distributing and merchandising products on our store shelves.  Operating, general and administrative costs, or OG&A, declined 32 basis points to 17.65% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and stock option expense, OG&A declined 34 basis points versus last year. This decline was driven by strong identical sales leverage, increased productivity, and progress we have made in controlling our energy and healthcare expenses. These gains were partially offset by higher incentive pay based on Kroger's strong 2006 results.  Credit card fees also increased as a percent of sales during the quarter. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.4% compared to 37.6% during the same period last year. Excluding adjustments to certain deferred tax balances, our fourth quarter 2006 tax rate was 37.4%.  During the fourth quarter, Kroger repurchased 4.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $23.13, for a total investment of $105.8 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, $233 million remained under our $500 million stock buyback announced in May of 2006. Since January 2000, Kroger has invested $5.6 billion to repurchase shares and to reduce total debt. Of this total, $3.6 billion was used to repurchase 184.7 million shares at an average price of $19.56 per share.  Total debt was further reduced by $2 billion. We ended fiscal 2006 with a total debt balance of $7.1 billion, a reduction of $172.9 million from a year ago. Our investment rate grade rating continues to be very important to us. Our debt to EBITDA ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.89, an improvement of 17 basis points from the same period last year.  Now turning to Kroger's fiscal 2006 performance. Total sales increased 9.2% to $66.1 billion for the full fiscal year. After adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2006, total sales increased 7% over fiscal 2005. Net earnings for fiscal 2006 were $1.11 billion, or $1.54 per diluted share. Fiscal 2006 included a 53rd week that benefited the year by an estimated $0.07 per diluted share.  You might recall that our 2006 guidance contemplated a favorable impact of $0.05 per diluted share from the 53rd week. As it turned out, that particular week was extraordinarily strong one for our business and we surpassed our original sales and profit expectations by a meaningful amount. This was largely due to weather conditions in certain parts of the country.  Fiscal 2006 earnings also included $0.03 of expense per diluted share for legal reserves recorded in the first quarter. This item was contemplated in our December guidance of 8% to 10% growth in earnings per diluted share. Additionally, fiscal 2006 benefited from the $0.03 per diluted share from the adjustment of certain deferred tax balances that were not contemplated in the company's guidance.  In fiscal 2005, net earnings were $958 million or $1.31 per diluted share. During the year, FIFO gross margin declined 53 basis points to 24.27% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin declined 27 basis points from the prior year. Our fiscal 2006 supermarket selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 34 basis points, reflecting Kroger's strategy of delivering value for our customers.  Full year OG&A expense, which do not include rent and depreciation expense, declined 30 basis points to 17.91% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, stock option expense and the increase in legal reserve, OG&A declined 28 basis points.  Strong identical sales leverage and operating cost reductions allowed us to fund investments and additional service and value for our customers.  Our fiscal 2006 operating margin rose 2 basis points over the prior year. Excluding the effect of retail fuel sales, stock option expense and the increase in legal reserve, Kroger's operating margin increased 23 basis points over the prior year. In 2006 Kroger was able to balance cost savings and productivity improvements to improve our customers' shopping experience. Sales leverage over rent and depreciation expense provided most of the operating margin expansion.  Now before sharing some additional guidance for 2007, I would like to compare the 2006 objectives we set out for investors a year ago to Kroger's actual results. Thanks to the efforts of all our associates, Kroger delivered another year of consistently strong results during the fiscal year, and exceeded our original guidance for both identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth.  Our original target for fiscal 2006 identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel was to exceed 3.5%. Each quarter, we raised that target to reflect our sales momentum throughout the year. Today we reported full year identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel of a positive 5.6%, well in excess of our original goal.  We originally expected to deliver earnings per share growth in 2006 of 6% to 8%. In December, we raised that range to 8% to 10%. Today we reported earnings per share growth of 15% on a basis consistent with this guidance. Our quarterly cash dividend added further value of a little over 1% to this growth. Our earnings per share growth was driven primarily by three factors: strong identical sales, slightly improving operating margins, and fewer shares outstanding.  We plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in capital projects during the year. Our actual capital expenditures for 2006 came in at $1.8 billion. We opened, expanded, relocated or acquired 53 supermarkets. We completed 158 remodels. Our total supermarket square footage grew 1.5% excluding acquisitions and operational closings. Our return on assets improved almost 104 basis points on a pre-tax basis using the method Kroger has consistently used to calculate return on assets.  When you look at the everything together, we had a terrific year. Kroger's strategic plan served our customers, our associates and our shareholders well in fiscal 2006. We believe it will continue to enable the company to achieve its objectives in 2007.  As you know, Dave outlined our sales and earnings guidance for 2007 earlier. While we do not give specific quarterly guidance, I do want to remind you of the timing of certain items in 2006 that will affect our quarterly earnings per share growth during 2007. I would like to note that we anticipate earnings per share growth rates in the first and fourth quarters of 2007 will be less than the annual growth rate. That in turn means the second and third quarters will be higher. This is important to remember when you're calculating your 2007 quarterly estimates, because the first and fourth quarters in 2006 were very strong.  Additionally, the first quarter of 2006 was reduced by $0.03 per diluted share due to the legal reserve, and in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $0.10 per share higher due to the extra week and the adjustments in deferred taxes. I would like to point out that our guidance assumes the same intensity from a competitive environment that we operate in today.  Here are some other expectations that are incorporated into our guidance for the year. We plan to invest $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in capital projects, excluding acquisitions. This capital budget includes approximately 60 major projects covering new stores, expansions and relocations and 200 remodels, plus other investments to support our customer-first business strategy.  We anticipate total supermarket square footage growth of 2% before acquisitions and operational closings, with an emphasis on our large, fast-growing markets. We expect to make a cash contribution of approximately $125 million to the company-sponsored retirement plans, a reduction of about $25 million from fiscal 2006.  We forecast that our tax rate for fiscal 2007 will be approximately 38%, excluding the effects from the interpretation of FASB Interpretation Number 48, Accounting for Uncertainties in Income Taxes.  As you know, we have several labor negotiations this year covering store associates in Southern California, Cincinnati, Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Toledo, Seattle and West Virginia. Negotiations this year will be challenging, as we must have competitive cost structures in each market, while meeting our associate needs for good wages and affordable healthcare.  Now I would like to turn it back over to Dave for some closing remarks. 
 David Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. We are very pleased with the results for our fourth quarter and fiscal 2006. As Rodney discussed, our fiscal 2006 results compared favorably to each of the objectives we outlined for you at the beginning of 2006.  We made significant strides in several key areas. We grew our average market share by 65 basis points despite intense competition; we showed even stronger growth in markets where we compete directly with supercenters. These gains clearly show our plan is working. We continue to balance operating cost reductions with investments aimed at improving our customers' overall shopping experience in all aspects, including service, product quality and selection and value. Keeping our efforts focused on each and every customer is so important as we continue to face competitive challenges on all fronts.  We believe we have the right approach to uniquely meeting the diverse needs of today's shoppers, and we have the talented people to do so in 2007 and beyond. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Can you guys talk to the performance of remodels this past year versus the year before or the year before that? Is the performance in terms of comp lift and related margin, is that getting a lot better? 
Rodney McMullen:  If you look at their performance they continue to be reasonably good. It would not be appreciably better this year than the last two years, but we are doing a few additional remodels in '06 than what we did in '05 and '04.  As you know, when you look toward '07, our intent would be to increase the number of remodels even higher than what we did in '06. 
 David Dillon:  John, you can tell we're pretty bullish on what our remodels do for us. But that has been true now for several years. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Secondly, what's the update on marketplace and the non-food more broadly in the traditional supermarkets? 
 David Dillon: We called out drug GM as having particularly good results, both a good regular quarter and a good seasonal quarter. So we're pleased with the non-foods generally there. Marketplace continues to grow for us as a format. This past year, we introduced stores in the Cincinnati market. We have also announced next year for Wichita, and Tucson I think will open I think later this year; we've announced that as well.  So we continue to growth, both in the communities where we have those stores, but we also continue to add a few new communities at the same time. Rodney, do you want to add anything on marketplace? 
Rodney McMullen:  No, other than it is safe to assume that we're working on two or three additional markets that haven't been announced yet for the marketplace stores and we continue to be very pleased with the results because our customer reaction has been very positive to those stores. 
 John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Finally, the market share data, have you been able to cut back -- I am sure you have -- in looking at where supercenters are the most mature and where their footage or their capacity is pretty limited in terms of growth? Obviously, I would think the market share numbers would look better in those mature markets. What have you looked although on that front? 
 David Dillon:  Well, we have dissected the data a bit and I don't know if Rodney wants to add anything to that, but I don't think I will comment directly on your specific question, but I will answer it maybe this way: We gave some information that should help you see the bigger picture to this puzzle, is that roughly 47% or so of the major markets is held by competitors that we believe, that we define, don't have the same kind of economies of scales that we think we have. That is slowly declining.  That appears to us to be where our market share gains are, because generally speaking, we did look to see, for instance, in Wal-Marts and the markets we identified as having Wal-Mart as a number three or higher position, as we looked as those markets, it appeared that Wal-Mart was not losing position particularly, but that these other competitors were the ones that were losing position compared to where we were and compared to where Wal-Mart was. So they continue to grow, continue to build, continue to have impact in the market. But in the face of that, so do we. 
Rodney McMullen: As a general rule, and this isn't just for marketplace stores, it is any time you would have a major new competitor coming in, it would take about three years before you start recovering market share in a meaningful way. But that comment would be true for a supercenter, and would also be true for a traditional competitor that's coming into a market in a major way.  For us, you've heard us talk about it before, but it always takes longer for competitors to fall out than what we would have guessed, but it always eventually happens. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Husson - HSBC. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC: Good morning, astonishing quarter. Well done. Want to talk a little bit about what you're selling, in particular the private brand business. I think you hired a new VP of Corporate Brands -- I could be wrong there. Your approach to branding the Kroger, the various Kroger family of brands around the country. You can't have these kinds of sales and this kind of market share improvement without fairly consistent and improving corporate message, and the consumer response to that.  So first of all branding. Secondly, private brand, has it gone up? Also finally, private brand manufacturing and how that worked in the quarter? 
 David Dillon: Mark, we would be happy to talk about that. But you said astonishing. I like the use of that word. Before I get to that, though, I want to talk a little bit about what we're trying to do in our Kroger brand. We did, in fact, hire a new Vice President for the Kroger brand area, and that is an important step for us because we think we can do even better yet than what we've accomplished. As you know in the last several years, we've had good improvements in what Kroger brand represented to our customers in share, both on cases and in dollars.  This past year, in the face of strong sales in lots of our national brand areas, too, we still managed to gain some progress in our Kroger brand areas, but we think we can do even better yet, and believe that this step is a way to do that. We're very proud of what we've accomplished in manufacturing this past year, what Kroger brand has accomplished this past year, and see a terrific future ahead for that whole theme.  Do you want to add anything, Rodney? 
Rodney McMullen: The only thing I was going to add on both aspects, it really is using the Kroger brand or the Ralph’s brand or Fred Meyer, whatever the brand would be, and making it a competitive advantage versus our competition and doing something for our customers that they can't get anywhere else. To me, all of those themes is really about delivering on both of those fronts. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC:  What are the challenges, though? I mean, the Kroger brands or whatever the brand is in the local market means different things in different places. How can you ensure around the country that there has been the same kind of weight of thought behind brand development as you might have in the core Kroger business? 
 David Dillon:  If I am understanding your question, are you concerned, for instance, when we use a brand that says Ralph’s on it, or Fred Meyer on it, whether or not we can build the same kind of following? 
 Mark Husson - HSBC: Yes. 
 David Dillon: Well, in that situation, it is actually pretty easy to answer. Think of our customers as local customers. Our customers are not national customers. When they shop at a Fred Meyer store, they're shopping at a Fred Meyer store. They're not shopping in their mind at a Kroger store.  I am fascinated by the way customers can quickly make the leap, though, to recognize that Fred Meyer is owned by Kroger, and is actually quite pleased to see some Kroger brands at Fred Meyer. But they similarly take great pride in seeing Fred Meyer's name on the products in Fred Meyer stores, and both of those seem to actually work quite well.  We believe both have merit, too, because we are going to market locally. Our customers are locally based, and having some products with the local name I think has lots of merit. But I think all of our research, our taste tests, our profiles, everything we've looked at from a marketing point of view, suggests that both pieces of that strategy work just fine, and we're not at all uncomfortable in having some locally-named products, as well. 
 Mark Husson - HSBC: Final question on this whole thing on organics and the premium quality food, and do your brands locally have the same level of execution on those areas? Or are some brands better than others? 
 David Dillon:  Well I would say we vary a little bit, but that variance would be more based on customer demand or store size than probably other characteristics. Organics are doing well generally. Our Kroger brands of those, we have actually several. We have a natural line of products, some of which could be organic, and we have some Private Selection organic products, and both of those sets are doing very well in terms of growth. I am very pleased with that progress. The growth in these kinds of items seems to be broad-based clear across the country. There is not any part of the country I don't think at least that is not showing some growth there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research:  Great quarter. If you could just quickly tell us what the option expense was for all of fiscal '06, and what you're looking at for fiscal '07, both on a dollars basis and an EPS basis? 
 Mike Schlotman:  Well, for 2006 it was about $0.06. 
 Rodney McMullen:  $72 million. 
 Mike Schlotman:  And for 2007 on a cents per share basis we would expect something pretty similar to that. I don't know on the dollars, Mike. 
 Rodney McMullen:  Similar. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research:  That's $72 million? 
 Mike Schlotman:  Yes. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research: Can you comment on what role perhaps gift card and gasoline promotions had in the fourth quarter, and might have made it even stronger than it otherwise would have? 
David Dillon:  Well, let's see. Gift cards do not go in sales, they go into other income; the income portion of it does. And so I suppose if you look at a Kroger gift card and that's gifted to someone, then when they go spend it, that becomes sales. So that could have had some impact there because we did have a good year on gift cards. But I don't put a whole lot of our results on that particularly.  We're pleased with the progress we've made. This year was noticeably better than the year before. We have a much wider assortment to offer on the gift cards and so forth. So it's a good program for us, but I would not suggest that that's the reason we had a gangbuster quarter. 
 Rodney McMullen:  That was not the driver of the fourth quarter results. Now with that said, our gift card program had a great fourth quarter. But that did not drive the fourth quarter results. 
David Dillon:  I think that's probably the right message, Chuck. It is a meaningful program for us and growing at a fast rate, but it was not the reason the results were as strong as they were. Similarly for gas, we didn't really change gasoline strategies during the quarter. We just continued what we've been doing through the year, and we think our gasoline strategy is an excellent one. We think it has certainly contributed to people wanting to shop at our stores because we offer great value on gasoline. But again, I don't think it is the reason for those results. There wasn't any particular incremental change in the quarter. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research:  Any comment on the jewelry store business in the quarter? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Our business was solid, and would be very similar to what our competitors did, and very pleased with the cash flow that business generated last year. 
 Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research:  Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Chick – JP Morgan. 
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan:  Good quarter. As I look at the quarter, by my math, Rodney, it looks like you came in $0.06 a share excluding the extra week, extra upside relative to maybe what you had thought. From what I see, sales were very good and pretty much in line with what you had expected. It looks like your selling gross margins were pretty much in check with the trends that you've been reporting. So where did the significant upside come from for the quarter? 
 Rodney McMullen: When you look it really was a solid result from everything. If you look at our identical sales, obviously, it was very strong and a little bit better than where we would have originally estimated. If you look at managing our growth and OG&A together, it was very well managed on both aspects. Certainly when you look at the leverage that the sales generated from a rent and depreciation standpoint, that was a little bit better than what we had expected. When you look at cumulative for the year, our share count was a little lower than what we expected and the LIFO charge was a little lower. So it is really five or six things working together in a way that turned out, obviously, an incredibly strong quarter. 
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: As we look at your guidance going into next year and you're saying slightly improved operating margins, can we think in the same context of what you've been doing, where selling gross margins are down say 20 to 30 basis points, and it is going to be SG&A driven for margin expansion next year? 
 Rodney McMullen:  The margin improvement on operating margin will be driven by the leverage from rent and depreciation that we would pick up from the sales growth, if you want to think of it from that perspective. The straight selling gross and OG&A perspective, we would expect to reinvest most of the OG&A savings at that level, either in pricing or better service for our customers, or a combination of both. 
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: This might be semantics maybe, but in your sales growth commentary for the quarter, you mentioned nutrition but I don't think you mentioned natural foods. I don't know if that's one in the same. The last three quarters, you've kind of highlighted natural foods specifically. Was there a change in category commentary? 
David Dillon:  Those are the same, Steve. Both of those categories we could use the words either way. Organics can actually be in that category, and sometimes would be in the specific department, for instance, meat or produce, would have some organics that would be in those departments. But the rest would be in the nutrition area. 
 Steve Chick - JP Morgan: Great. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research. 
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research:  Dave, I think you're roughly halfway through your five-year road map. I was wondering if maybe in your own words you could evaluate your progress to date? What has changed, if anything, and maybe some of the biggest opportunities to improve further from here? 
David Dillon: If you looked at it as five years, and we did describe it as five years, you would be correct. I think if anything, one thing I've learned is that the time horizon was a little different. Five years seems like a long time at the beginning of a cycle, but as you get into it, you don't get quite as much accomplished in the first year or two as what you maybe think.  I actually don't think we're halfway through on what we think we can achieve from the strategy we're on. I would see us as earlier in the process than that.  What I am trying to describe is strong future opportunity. Our strategy essentially is as we've described it, customer-first based, looking at growing our sales, which is the representation really of being meaningful to our customer. As we grow in how meaningful we are to our customer, our sales grow.  The way we grow in that meaning to the customer is making sure that the stores that we offer to them are individually important and relevant to them in their locations. We do that through what we've described as our four keys: from our people, our products, the shopping experience, and price. All of those have been important. The role our associates have played in this, I can't overestimate that. It is significant. I think it will be even more significant going down the road.  So I would say if I was looking at five equal periods of time in the beginning, I don't think we're halfway through that. I think we're maybe through one-and-a-half periods of that. So we have actually quite a bit of opportunity ahead for us. 
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Your top line performance and even your own internal measurements are showing some clear share gains, and I know you've addressed this in different ways saying there is multiple things, broad based, hundreds of things that are all contributing to that. But if you were to really narrow it down to probably the three most important drivers to your top line momentum, in the rearview mirror and even more so going forward, how would you rank order some of the most important levers for driving your business? 
David Dillon:  Well so far, I would rate a couple of things. First is I would rate what we've done on price as essential to what we've done. I think in addition to that, I would rate the shopping experience that our customers have in the stores that our associates offer, things like quicker checkout, friendlier people in the stores, the degree to which our associates want to satisfy particular needs of individual customers. Those areas I would think would be quite important.  I think the use of our data through our loyalty card and the Dunnhumby data that we have would be similarly important to making sure we rifle shoot at what we offer in our stores, what we offer in our ads, and what we offer in our marketing practices, both in mail and in store to individual customers. Dunnhumby has a role to play, too, in what we price and how we price it. So it certainly has had an impact in that regard. Do you want to add anything else, Rodney? 
 Rodney McMullen: Dave mentioned it, but in terms of the shopping experience on friendliness of our associates, but to me it is really broader than that. Certainly when you look at our internal measures, our associates were gaining on our internal measures on how our associates view working and communicating, and our customers are telling us the same. It is one of those where we're making progress, but we still have plenty of opportunity to improve more. And our associates really are starting to make huge amounts of difference in that, and we would expect to continue to even more so. 
 Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research:  Great. Thanks, and good work. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Good morning. Dave, as I recall, 2007 was to be a year I think when you indicated a plan to put a bigger focus on meat, seafood and produce. Just wondering what exactly you've done in those categories so far this year? Can you give us some indication of how those areas should contribute to sales? As I recall I think from the start of the call, meat and seafood I think weren't mentioned among your stronger departments in that quarter. 
David Dillon:  That's correct. Actually, we had strong results in seafood through the year. Meat was a little less strong, and in part that was impacted by significant deflation in the quarter, I believe it was in the quarter if I am remembering right. I am looking to Mike to see if that was accurate. Don't want to give you bad information.  But these are areas of focus for us, and we expect that this year we'll be strong in all of those areas. We just had a company-wide meeting just I think two weeks ago, and had a chance to drop by and see many of the meat and seafood people that were attending that, and thank them for the past year, but more importantly to comment on the opportunities for this year ahead.  We did refer, I think in our analyst meeting, to some steps we're taking in our key retailing process in the stores that we think will actually improve our sales and availability of product. That is partly rolled out. We've accomplished that in some of our stores. But I don't think we have it in all of them yet, but expect to, and that should pay some meaningful dividends.  In addition to that, I think we are paying some additional attention to what our customers want to buy in these areas and how we might improve on the offering. In produce, for instance, we have seen some good improvements in organic sales this past year and I would expect '07 would be much the same. Was I right on the inflation? 
 Mike Schlotman:  Meat was deflationary in every quarter except the third. 
David Dillon: So in the first, second and fourth quarter last year meat was deflationary, which contributed to part of the issue there. Seafood, though, we had great results there really through the year, although we don't normally break that out as a separate category. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: I guess as produce and meat grow, shrink becomes a bigger issue for you. So just wondering, has that been your experience so far this year? How is your progress on shrink so far? 
David Dillon:  Actually if I remember correctly, I may have Mike pull out the data to look, but shrink in the quarter -- not now, but in the fourth quarter -- I believe we actually showed some improvements compared to the year before in the perishable areas, in produce and meat in particular.  That was the direct result of some of the work that you were asking about, and I think we've made improvements because of that. Shrink continues to be an opportunity for us, and we think there is still good room for improvement there. But the opportunity in this last quarter was mostly in the grocery and drug GM areas. While we've had good progress from the beginning of when we've gone down this path, we just have seen times when we get challenged a bit, and we have to stop, step back and look at a balanced approach, make sure we don't impact our sales, make sure we look at the ways in which we can use technology to improve our results, and then move forward to make some gentle improvements. Is that fair, what I have said, Mike? 
 Mike Schlotman:  Produce and meat did both improve. Do keep in mind, as hopefully as you introduce new products in those categories, that's really when you have the incremental shrink upfront as those new categories, like organics and produce, catch on with consumers. Hopefully you don't have to put incremental more product out. You start selling more of it instead of shrinking the amount you did at the initiation of the program. 
David Dillon: We did comment earlier in the year about some increases in shrink in produce in particular because of that. And because I can't determine right now what kinds of new products and pushes we might have throughout the year, I am not going to try to project whether or not our shrink will go up or down in the perishable areas, but the most important part from our point of view, and this is what we would mean by rifle shooting it, is to look at the shrink and where it is derived.  In the example we just gave, if our shrink increase in produce was because of organics being introduced and being encouraged and pushed further in stores, that's one thing. If it is because of the other products that we've been carrying, that's quite another, and more controllable. So we tend to try to rifle shoot and say where is the shrink coming from, and where do we want to expand shrink a little bit to benefit sales, and where do we want to contract it because we think we have the ability to do that. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Just on the segmentation work that you've done on your stores, I think you've been trying to segment your stores into value, mainstream and upscale. I know the analysis is done. But I am just wondering how far along you are in actually executing changes in SKUs, signage, perishables, et cetera? 
David Dillon:  I wouldn't say we're very far along that path. We have done some work. This is probably a really good analogy to when you climb the top of a mountain and you look out over the mountain, you see the next mountain, and you think you accomplished something. But then you see that there is a lot more opportunity ahead.  This is an area where we've made some progress, but there is lots more to be done there, and even just on some of the simple stuff. We have paid attention to the pricing. We've paid attention to the product selection. We've paid attention to how we write our ads. We've paid attention to marketing within the stores. We've paid attention in some cases to a wider and narrower product selection, where appropriate. But past that, I would still see lots of additional opportunity. 
 Rodney McMullen:  This is an area where I don't think you will ever find us getting finished, because as we learn, we learn more that we can do even better for our customers. It is the reason why we find it so exciting, is the opportunity. 
 Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets:  That's good. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  I will have to add the congratulations on top of everybody else. I am going to start by asking a question I am not sure you can answer. Can you comment at all about what's going on in the Southern California negotiation? Is there anything that you feel comfortable saying? 
David Dillon:  Yes, I feel comfortable in saying no comment. All of the parties, the unions and the company have worked with the federal mediation, and we've all agreed and the federal mediator has encouraged us to not make comments about the negotiations for obvious reasons and so we're choosing not to do that. I think you all know we're operating under a two-week extension. We're about halfway through that two-week extension. Certainly, you'd take that as a good sign.  I don't think I would say anything more about the Southern California negotiations, other than what we've said always before, is that what we're looking for is a balanced approach that works well to keep us competitive, and works well for our associates to give them good wages and good healthcare and good benefits. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  Great. Another question would be about just looking at your balance sheet, it seems to me that your leverage has gotten to a pretty reasonable level for a company like Kroger. What would you do with free cash flow if you decided you really didn't need to pay down more debt? I know you would like to get back to a triple B rating, but your leverage seems to be there already. 
David Dillon:  I will let Mike or Rodney comment on that if you want. 
 Rodney McMullen:  I certainly wouldn't disagree that on your observation that it's at a very reasonable level. In terms of what we would do with the cash, it really would depend on the opportunities we see at that point in time. And at this point, we wouldn't be ready to say here is what we're going to do with it. As you know, we continue to use about one-third of our free cash flow to pay down debt and two-thirds to buy back stock and pay a dividend. Our intent would be to continue on that at this point. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  Okay. It looks pretty clear that you are able to take market share without having to put any capital down, not major capital, like acquisitions. Another leader in the grocery business did comment on acquisition opportunities increasing. I was just wondering what your perspective was on that? 
David Dillon:  I will let Rodney comment on acquisitions. But let me comment that one of the things that we found in emphasizing remodels, and one of the reasons we think we're getting decent results, or one of the signs we're getting decent results, is market share gain. It is a lower risk environment because we have a good strong reputation and we can improve it even more in those markets when we spend a little bit of capital in those stores to get them up to snuff.  I think what's happening with our market share growth without acquisition, I think that that's a direct result of the overall strategy focusing on the customer, taking those four keys seriously, the role our associates play in making all of that true, and then making sure our assets are in decent shape in those markets, has all contributed to that success without adding stores.  However, there is plenty of opportunity for acquisitions, and do you want to comment a little bit on that? 
 Rodney McMullen:  Well, I was just going to say, if you look at the last couple years, it is not lack of effort in terms of not being able to acquire anything. It has just been lack of being able to agree to a price that we think works for us and works for a seller. So it is not lack of looking at things and spending some time on it. We continue to see a lot of things out there. So far, there has been a disagreement or difference on what the price we would view something that we're willing to pay.  The other thing I would add that's our helping market share in some markets, is if you go back and look at the acquisitions we acquired three or four years ago, it is getting into those stores and expanding them when we can, doing a major remodel to them. When we initially bought them, we would have done a small remodel just to convert the banner. But as you go through time, you would expend more energy and be able to work with a landlord or buy the real estate or whatever, to do something more major to those stores and in a couple of markets or three markets, that certainly continues to help us. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers:  Great. My final question would be what you are experiencing in terms of Wal-Mart's expansion into new markets. Certainly they have been putting an effort on western markets where real estate is tougher. Do you see that process accelerating?  I think I had heard a comment that in Cincinnati you were able to really fend them off very well or compete with them extremely effectively. What are you seeing in other parts of the country? 
David Dillon:  Well Wal-Mart continues to grow as we commented, I think we said for us, at least, additional 125 stores that we compete against, which is really significant in my mind, anyway. I think earlier, Rodney commented, and I think it is probably the right way to think about this, is that any new entrant to a market, whether it is a Wal-Mart supercenter or whether it is a more traditional competitor, new entrants change those markets for a period of time, and as a result have an impact.  We are seeing Wal-Mart come into new additional markets that they had not previously been in. You commented on the west. That's certainly true. It is also true in other markets. They really hadn't been in Cincinnati until just recently and now there is quite a few stores and more to go. So we see them lots of places. I just don't think that that picture is changing much from what it was last year or maybe even the year before that. 
 Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Todd Duvick - Banc of America. 
 Todd Duvick - Banc of America:  I wanted to circle back on the balance sheet if I could quickly. Generally speaking on the fixed income side, reducing debt is a good thing. But we've seen over the last year or so, it is kind of like a narrow band in which, if you get leverage too low, it is almost a bad thing. And in fact, Kroger is showing up on some LBO screens, although I don't think there is a high likelihood of that.  We've also seen private equity kind of rearing its head, especially in Europe. So I am just wondering if you can comment on what you view as your optimal capital structure, and do you see a point in the future where debt reduction is no longer a viable use of your cash? 
David Dillon:  Do you want to talk about the capital structure? 
 Mike Schlotman:  I would really just reiterate what Rodney said earlier in response to Meredith's question, and we do agree that our leverage is fairly low for our structure. We think we've done a good job of managing our debt to equity ratio, and delevering the balance sheet. At this point the alternate uses of those cash, is again, it depends on the opportunities. As Rodney said on the acquisition front, it is not for lack of trying. It is for lack of being able to agree on a price. So certainly the opportunity, if any of those come to fruition where we can agree on price or would have agreed on price, it is nice to be able to make some of those smaller acquisitions, and not have any worries about what it does to your leverage ratio. We'll continue to buy in stock and continue to pay a dividend, as we have been last year for the dividend, last several years for buying in stock. 
 Blake Smith - Banc of America:  Okay. And this is actually Blake Smith in for Scott Mushkin here, we're at the Banc of America conference here. I just wanted to ask a quick question if I could. In the third quarter call related to pricing right with Wal-Mart, pricing right with the big boxes. Where do you think you are in that process at this point, three months later? 
David Dillon:  The pricing that we've described before, if you go back several years ago, we needed to take some rather important big steps and we took those. Then about a year, maybe two years ago now, we said that at the pricing level we're at now, we're satisfied that our sales are beginning to grow and that our prices are in the range of appropriate with our customers. As a result, we want to invest in pricing only as we're able to save money through our operations and in effect, pay the bill. That's been our operation this whole past year.  I should point out, the savings we generate through OG&A, productivity, other things that we are able to save, and in some of the expenses in our gross margin, like shrink and advertising, warehousing and logistics, all of those areas, as we make progress, our intent is to reinvest in both price and in other things that may raise our actual operating costs, like shopping experience and training and some of those areas. So we would say we'll continue that path down the future. We don't see that changing much. But because we made the big progress we were after a couple years ago, we also don't see taking unilateral steps on price without paying for it as we go. 
 Blake Smith - Banc of America: You've talked about this a little bit. But where do you see the use of the Dunnhumby data and sort of merchandising at the sort of store cluster level, and those kind of things a couple years out? I mean, what kind of things are you working on on that front? 
David Dillon:  I don't think I am going to tip our hand on some of the future opportunities with it. But suffice it to say that we're bullish on the use of our customer data and customer loyalty data to determine what paths we ought to take in the future in marketing and in advertising and in store mix, products, pricing, all of those areas. I think in two or three years out it will be more significant than it is today. We certainly expect it to be. 
 Blake Smith - Banc of America:  Thank you. 
David Dillon:  Thank you. We have time for one more question. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Neil Currie - UBS. 
 Neil Currie - UBS:  I wonder if I could just ask about the gross margin. I think one of the keys to your successes has been your willingness to not just reinvest gross margin gains, but you are actually continuing to take down your gross margin to levels which I presume other supermarkets just can't compete with. Balance that with obviously OG&A improvements. Is there any magic number that you feel as if you are aiming for, or careful enough to get to low? Or are you just happy to continue with this strategy of going for gross profit dollars? 
David Dillon:  Neil, really what we're going for is a balance. The dollars are essential. We do look at this as a dollar gain. Over time, we try to evaluate where we are in each market and each category, and make deliberate steps. We do not have a several years out end game that says here is where we will have arrived. I think we check our position as we go.  I think it is true in retail markets that it is sort of a fluid business and you have to read that really quarter to quarter, year to year, to see where you are on pricing and where you want to be on pricing. Yet, I think you can see that we were certainly more comfortable with where we are after just a year or so ago, as we shifted to investing only as we were able to save the money.  I think that's important for us to note that we are generally pleased with where we are. Specifically, we always see some opportunity for improvement, and we'll target that as we both can afford to do so and see the opportunity to do so. 
 Neil Currie - UBS:  Do you see lower gross margins now as an actual strength of the company? 
David Dillon: Absolutely. In fact, I was commenting to someone just yesterday, that when we look at variances from one quarter to another, one year to another, we typically put brackets around things that are unfavorable, and don't put brackets around it when it is favorable. In the past, we've always shown gross margins when they decline as unfavorable with brackets around it. I said, we probably shouldn't put brackets around that, that's a favorable move. We actually see it as a strength, as an advantage, and as a plus, particularly in selling gross margin, as we look at our selling gross margin. Because to the extent we can reduce the expenses that are otherwise in gross, that allows us in our selling gross margin to be even more meaningful to our customer. 
 Neil Currie - UBS:  Well certainly agree with you there. Congratulations. 
David Dillon:  Good. Thank you. Well, as we close, let me make a few comments before we sign off. I want to offer some additional comments to the associates that are listening in today. On behalf of our customers and shareholders, I want to congratulate and thank all 300,000 plus associates across all our banners and operations for a really successful year. The market share gains we outlined earlier underscore the efforts that you make on a daily basis. You are the reason behind our success and we appreciate your hard work and dedication.  There is one more important area where Kroger excels that we should be proud of. That is leading the fight to end hunger in America. Last year, our family of stores contributed more than 30 million pounds of food and other products to more than 85 food banks serving the local communities where we operate. Thanks to the generous contributions of our customers, our associates and our vendors, those donations provided more than 22 million meals to families and individuals across the country through food banks, soup kitchens and emergency pantries.  Kroger has been supporting the fight to end hunger in America for more than 25 years. Last year, we were again selected Retailer of the Year by America's Second Harvest, the largest hunger relief organization in the U.S. It is the fourth time in six years our company has received this award. This honor is particularly noteworthy because food banks across the country select the recipient. Kroger was selected again because of the relationships our associates have directly with local food banks. We are proud of the longstanding relationships you have all helped to build in our communities. We're helping to combat hunger as one of Kroger's core priorities, and we appreciate the role of our associates, customers and our vendors play in helping us make a difference in every community we serve.  In closing, because of you, we had a terrific year. Thank you all.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Kroger Co. third quarter 2006 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like the turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Carin Fike. Please proceed, ma'am.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material affect on our business, on an ongoing basis. is contained in our SEC filings. Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I would like to introduce Mr. David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.
David Dillon: Thanks, Carin and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's third quarter financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .  I would like to begin this morning by briefly reviewing Kroger's third quarter financial performance. Then I will provide an update on Kroger's outlook for 2006, and Rodney will share additional details about our third quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Total sales for the third quarter increased 4.8% to $14.7 billion. Identical supermarket sales increased 4.9% with fuel, and 5.3% without fuel. Supermarket retail fuel prices were about 10% lower this year versus last year. Across the company, growth continues to be broad based. We experienced particularly strong growth in produce, natural foods, deli/bakery, pharmacy and seafood. Our convenience stores had another strong quarter both in fuel and non-fuel merchandise.  Net earnings in the third quarter totaled $214.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. These results include $0.01 per diluted share related to stock option expense, and for comparison purposes, net earnings in the same period last year were $185.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share.  Our fuel business had a strong quarter in sales, gallons and in margin. While fuel margins for the quarter were strong, on a year-to-date basis they were more normalized. We're pleased with our third quarter results and want to thank our associates for their role in delivering them. In this intensely competitive industry, our associates continue to focus on putting customers first.  These results once again demonstrate Kroger's ability to consistently deliver strong, sustainable growth over time. In fact, this marks the 13th consecutive quarter Kroger has reported positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel. Next I would like to comment on Kroger's year-to-date performance. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2006, total sales increased 7.5% to $49.3 billion. For the same period, identical supermarket sales increased 6.7% with fuel, and 5.6% without fuel.  Net earnings for the first three quarters of fiscal 2006 were $730.1 million or $1.01 per diluted share. During the same period last year, net earnings were $676 million or $0.92 per diluted share. The fiscal 2006 year-to-date results include $0.04 per diluted share for stock option expense and $0.03 of expense per diluted share for the legal reserves recorded in the first quarter. Based on Kroger's year-to-date financial performance and sustained sales momentum leading into the holiday season, we now anticipate identical supermarket sales growth will exceed 5% for the fourth quarter, excluding fuel. We are also raising our guidance for earnings per share growth in fiscal 2006 to 8% to 10% from 6% to 8%. Based on current results, we are striving for the upper end of that range. We're confirming our guidance for earnings per share growth in fiscal 2007 of 6% to 8% after adjusting for the benefit of the 53rd week in 2006 and the increase in the legal reserve recorded in 2006. Based on current business trends, we are targeting the high-end of this range next year.  Now I would like to turn to Rodney who will share additional details on our guidance as well as our third quarter results. 
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we believe our third quarter performance is the result of our associates' continuing focus on our customers. Our disciplined approach is working. We continue to balance operating cost reductions with investments aimed at improving our customer's overall shopping experience.  I would like to provide some detail on the components of Kroger's operating margin during the quarter. Let's begin with gross margin. FIFO gross margin as a percent of sales was 24.48% this quarter, unchanged from the prior period last year. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin declined 12 basis points from the prior year. We continue to invest in lower prices for our customers, as demonstrated by the 17 basis point decline in supermarket selling gross margin.  During recent calls, we've discussed this metric we use internally to help us evaluate the pricing dimension of our Customer First strategy. We define selling gross margin as the company's gross margin before incurring expenses directly related to distributing and merchandising products on the store shelves. Examples include advertising, warehousing, transportation and shrink. During the quarter, we invested operating cost savings in lower prices for our customers. This remains an important part of Kroger's strategy. Operating, general and administrative costs or OG&A are also an important component of operating margin. Kroger's third quarter OG&A costs as a percent of sales increased 4 basis points to 18.27%. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and stock option expense, OG&A declined 17 basis points. This decline was driven by leveraging identical sales and progress we've made in controlling our health care costs, offset by continued pressure in pension expense and credit card fees. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter that Kroger's OG&A rate on this basis has declined, and yet we still see additional opportunities to continue this downward trend in the future in the right way. We also see additional opportunities to reduce operating costs embedded in our gross margin, for example shrink, advertising, warehousing, and transportation costs.  Kroger's operating margin on a GAAP basis increased 9 basis points to 3.05% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel sales and stock option expense, operating margin increased 21 basis points. A sizable portion of this increase came from sales leverage over rent and depreciation expense. Excluding closed store activity, we continue to expect rent expense as a percent of total sales to decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on owning real estate plus leverage from our strong identical sales growth. Similarly, we anticipate continued leverage over depreciation expense resulting from the strong identical sales growth and improved efficiency in capital investment. Kroger's operating margin can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of our cost savings and our re-investment of those savings. That's why we continue to encourage investors to evaluate our operating margin over a longer timeframe to gauge the success of our business strategy.  On a year-to-date GAAP basis, Kroger's operating margin decreased 7 basis points to 3.13% of sales. However, the important measure is to exclude the effect of retail fuel sales, stock option expense and the increase in legal reserves. On this basis, operating margins increased 17 basis points. We still forecast slightly improving operating margins for fiscal 2006, resulting from the leverage of strong identical sales growth over expenses including rent and depreciation. During the quarter, Kroger's strong free cash flow enabled us to invest in our store base, reduce debt, repurchase shares, and pay cash dividends. Capital investments totaled $415 million for the quarter compared to $336.9 million a year ago. For fiscal 2006, we plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in capital projects. Based on our current run rate, we expect to close the year near the low end of this estimate.  We anticipate total supermarket square footage growth of 1.5% to 2% before acquisitions and operational closings. For the third quarter, total supermarket square footage grew 1.4% year over year, excluding acquisitions and operational closings. Our return on asset measure improved almost 94 basis points on a pretax basis. This is using the method Kroger has consistently used to calculate return on assets. Total debt was $7 billion, a reduction of $299.1 million from a year ago. Our investment grade rating continues to be very important to us. We have focused on improving our coverage ratios since merging with Fred Meyer in 1999. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio in the third quarter was 2.0, an improvement of 22 basis points from the same period last year.  During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 10.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $22.79 for a total investment of $232 million. At the end of the third quarter, $322.8 million remained under the $500 million stock buyback announced in May of 2006. Since January 2000 Kroger has invested $5.3 billion to repurchase shares and to reduce net total debt. Of this total, $3.5 billion was used to repurchase 180.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $19.46 per share. This equates to approximately 20% of the company. Kroger expects to continue to buy back stock in 2006 in accordance with the company's strategy of using one-third of free cash flow for debt reduction and two-thirds for stock repurchase and cash dividend payments. Our third quarter tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.4% for the prior year. We continue to expect our tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be 37.8%. As Dave mentioned, on a GAAP basis, we have raised our guidance on earnings per share growth this year to 8% to 10%. Based on current results, we are striving for the upper end of this range. As we look to fiscal 2007, we continue to anticipate earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%. As a reminder, the 6% to 8% growth rate for 2007 should be applied after reducing fiscal 2006 GAAP earnings by a net of $0.02 per share. This net adjustment to 2006 earnings reflects the $0.05 benefit from the 53rd week, offset by $0.03 of additional legal expense. As Dave said earlier, based on Kroger's current business trends, we are targeting the high-end of this range. This is the same range we provided for 2007 earnings per share growth when we released our year end 2005 results in March. But this will start with a higher base as 2006 earnings are trending higher than originally anticipated. We will provide more details for the 2007 targets in March when we release year end results for 2006. Before I turn it back to Dave, I would like to comment briefly on labor as we head into 2007. It will be a heavy year as negotiations open, covering store associates in Southern California, Cincinnati, Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Toledo, Seattle, and West Virginia. Many of these contracts may be challenging as we seek competitive cost structures in each market. In every contract negotiation, we work to reach a balanced agreement that meets the cost efficiency objectives while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. Maintaining this balance allows Kroger to invest in our business to provide new job opportunities for existing associates and create new jobs for more people. We look forward to constructive negotiations in the new year. Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks. 
David Dillon: Thanks, Rodney. Kroger's performance this quarter shows consistent improvement as we steadily execute our business strategy. This allows us to be competitive in every aspect of our business and generate value for our shareholders. In fact, this week, shareholders will receive another quarterly dividend check, the third one the Kroger Board has declared since March. The dividend is a vote of confidence by our Board that our Customer First strategy is on target. These results clearly show what we can achieve by focusing on improving the service, product selection, quality and pricing that we offer customers throughout the year. Now we'll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman - Goldman Sachs.
Simeon Gutman - Goldman Sachs: First, given that your selling gross margin was relatively stable this quarter and that your IDs did not appear to suffer are you starting to feel greater comfort with the level of price investments you made? I know the process is never truly complete, but as you budget next year, how does it impact the way you approach it?
Rodney McMullen: We're actually feeling more comfortable with the overall balance of the plan. Think about the strategy as we described it: price certainly is important and the investment in price is important, and we have indicated that in the long run, we would anticipate additional price investment. We're comfortable enough with our price position that we think that putting additional emphasis on the shopping experience, on the people in our stores and the products we sell and balancing the focus on those, investing in those areas can produce the sales that we need.  I think I would come to a similar conclusion you did, but a little bit for different reasons because I think that our results are being achieved by a balanced approach and are being impacted by more than just the price.
Simeon Gutman - Goldman Sachs: Can you discuss as it relates to gross margin the vendor allowances going into next year? How does the process work with timing in light of the top line momentum being good for quite some time? Is it fair to assume next year should be made more favorable and is this done all ahead of the year or in lumps across the year?
Rodney McMullen: I am not sure I fully understood your question. If I understand your question, it is how do promotional allowances from vendors come to us through the year? Actually it is randomly distributed, is the best way to think of it. It is not like we sit down in December and negotiate all the promotional allowances for next year. Now, some of that happens; but as the year goes on, there are promotional strategies that get developed by the CPG companies and by the grocery companies, and those happen throughout the whole year. It is pretty evenly distributed.
David Dillon: One other note on allowances, all of our allowances we put in cost of goods, so we actually reduce the price that we pay for the product from the vendor, and we do not recognize that allowance until we actually sell the item to the customer.
Simeon Gutman - Goldman Sachs: Lastly, can you just shed some more light on your comment about the pharmacy business? You mentioned it was doing well. What's driving it? Because I think reports regarding Medicare Part D suggest the supermarket channel didn't fare as well from Medicare Part D. Separately, discuss how the Wal-Mart $4 generic program has been affecting your pharmacy business.
David Dillon: Well, I think about the best I can say is that our pharmacy business is good. We singled it out among several departments to make sure that we commented on it because it is doing well. The results are because customers find what we provide to be relevant to what they want in the way of pharmacy services. I realize that is sort of begging the question because the reason our identical sales are up there and our scripts are doing well there is because more customers come in. I think that that is in essence the answer to everything from the Part D to the impact of Wal-Mart's generic prescription program. We obviously are not going to comment from a competitive point of view on Wal-Mart's prescription program. I think you probably read that we do have three smaller markets in which we have put in similar programs, and our purpose there, as we said, is simply to be familiar with the relative impact of those prices and the mix change and all of the other elements that go with a program like that, but we're not announcing or deciding actually any additional steps at this point. We think it is too early to do so.
Rodney McMullen: One other comment on our pharmacy business, our pharmacists are really focused on making sure they provide the right service to our customers. When we do our customer research we find time and time again this is a more important element in terms of where you pick your pharmacy as some of the other things that Dave talked about in terms of price. We know from the research that we score very well, and we know our pharmacists are really focused on even taking it to a higher level and providing what the customer needs, so we feel pretty good about where that business is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Husson - HSBC.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Good morning. I wonder if you could hold my hand a bit on the sales line. You have a comparable store sales number of 5.2%, and you've got actual sales growth of 4.9%. You also have square footage growth of 1.5%. Can you reconcile that for us?
Rodney McMullen: The 1.4% square footage growth is before acquisitions and operational closings. If you look at operational closings, we would have closed over 1% square footage, so if you look at the net change in square footage, it is down 0.2%, if you look at the square footage that we've actually closed. As you know, operationally, some of that would be northern California where we closed more stores than typical there.  In terms of the other pieces of it, a big piece of it would be our convenience store business because obviously over half of that business is gas. As Dave mentioned we had a meaningful deflation in selling retail gas per gallon, so that also pulled the C-store volume down; but not in terms of gallons. It was nicely up, but in terms of dollars it was down. Really those two components would be the two biggest parts, Mark.
Mark Husson - HSBC: So the C-store comp store sales that you report in your aggregate group comp is only in the bulk sales.
Rodney McMullen: We do not include convenience store comps at all in our supermarket identicals.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Nothing in there? Okay. That's useful. Then just --
Rodney McMullen: I am sorry, Mark. As Dave mentioned, our gallons and our inside sales at the C-stores were up very nicely. We are very pleased with that result.
David Dillon: The only thing driving the percentages that looked a little odd was because the retail price was down. All of the other metrics were good.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Just in terms again on the sales line which obviously is a very good one, you've seen some competitive activity. You talked in your conference about seeing competitive closures in the marketplace. You talk about capacity coming out. You did have some specific store closures in this period. Did that meaningfully affect the sales line or not?
Rodney McMullen: No.
David Dillon: I don't believe it did.
Rodney McMullen: And as Dave mentioned, it was broad-based in terms of the sales strength. That's one of the things that we obviously always track is how is our identical sales track versus specific competitors and across markets, and it was very broad-based.
Mark Husson - HSBC: One final small question. Just on the private branded manufacturing business, can you comment on whether the velocity in private brand is as good as it is for your overall business?
Rodney McMullen: In terms of units, it is good. It is growing.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Manufacturing performing well, poorly?
Rodney McMullen: Oh, yeah, we're quite happy with the manufacturing team. They've done a nice job.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets. 
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: The rent charge in the quarter seems very low compared to where it's been in previous quarters and last year. I know you alluded to it a little bit, but perhaps you can explain why it is as low as it is?
Rodney McMullen: It is really if you look at the number of stores that we closed in the third quarter itself, where we had to take the present value and the future expected rent was lower this year than last year, and we did not have very much of that expense in the quarter.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: So going forward this rent number as a percent of sales is a reasonably good guidance for forecasting?
Rodney McMullen: Well, I would say yes, but I would put one caveat on that. Obviously depending on the timing of closing stores and the amount of remaining lease liability on those it could affect the number.
Michael Schlotman: Perry, keep in mind the day we close a store we have to book the net present value of the future lease, and quarter to quarter this year we simply had fewer of that activity this year versus last year.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Okay. That's fine. A question for Dave, then, on the pricing outlook going forward. I guess you segment your stores among value, mainstream and upscale, I am wondering if that's beginning to have an impact on the necessary price investments? Presumably if you have a more accurate offering of quality, variety and service or whatever in each store, I would think it would allow to you rely a little less on price. Are we beginning to see that and beginning to forecast next year, would that have an impact on your necessary price investments?
David Dillon: I think we're seeing that, Perry, actually not just because of segmentation as you describe, but for all of the reasons that are embedded in our strategy. Price is but an element of why customers choose where they go, and we took of course some strong hair cuts initially in this plan, which helped get the momentum going and which helped set the tone. While there is still some more work to be done, I think you're absolutely correct to say that some of these other elements can offset the need to go much deeper on price in some elements of some areas. We seek here to have a sustainable strategy, one that we can balance over time and that comes out in a good equation for the shareholders, for the customers, and for our associates, and I think that what you're saying is absolutely correct.  It is the reason, though, that we even said a year or so ago, maybe two years ago now where we said that essentially we're going to invest in price only to the extent that we can find a way to pay for it through lower costs and that it is our overall long-term strategy. We reached that conclusion because we think we had gotten to the point where some of these other pieces of our strategy could carry some weight. I think you're correct in your statement.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Just one last slightly related question. Your new store productivity system, I am presuming is rolled out or close to being rolled out by now. I am wondering if you saw any of these benefits in this quarter or is that still to come? Where you'll see the benefits and again is that part of the savings that should offset the price declines?
David Dillon: We have a number of things in play that are working on productivity in our stores, and several of those had an impact, really through the whole year, and several of those had an impact just in the quarter; but there is more to come. It is kind of early in the process of our most recent steps, but it did have some impact in the quarter, yes.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: That's good for now. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Good morning, everybody.
Rodney McMullen: Good morning.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: A couple of questions for you. In the past, you guys have talked about making price investments and it seems like you sometimes go too far in one quarter and then pull back a little bit in the next quarter. I hear everything you're saying that you're getting what you want out of your price investments, but was there any of that in second quarter and third quarter or was the level of investment reasonably steady?
David Dillon: Meredith, I prefer to think of it a little bit differently. In the second quarter we made an intentional choice to invest a little bit more in advance of our original plans, the plans that we made at the beginning of the year, because we saw an opportunity to do so and thought it was timely to do so, and so we took that step. We described that on the last call. In this quarter we didn't have anything like that where we did some advanced investments. The investments that we had intended for the quarter had started actually earlier, so I don't really think of it quite as the seesaw that you described, although I certainly can understand why you would draw that conclusion.  I wanted to put a little different perspective on it at least in the near term. A couple of years ago I remember where that would be a more correct description.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Okay. I wasn't sure it happened; I just wanted to make sure it hadn't happened. Another question for you would be a little bit more big picture. In the last six months there was a lot of discussion amongst retailers about the fact that higher gas prices were getting people to maybe shop closer to home and to aggregate their trips. As gas prices have come down, have you seen any real changes in behavior? I know it is very hard to know what consumers are doing, but is there anything in your data that points to a change?
David Dillon: I would say no, that there isn't anything in our data that points to a change, but some of the description that we have given -- and I will maybe go back through those in a second -- but some of the descriptions we've given aren't really provable by data. They're what you read about, what you hear from customers, what you think may be happening, and those include essentially the same descriptions we gave last quarter where we said look at the restaurant sales trend. Well, that's actual data. You can see what's happening in restaurant sales, so you can presume that if they're not eating in restaurants as often, that they are more likely buying something in our stores, taking it home and preparing it. We believe that is happening. Whether that's driven because of cost consciousness because it is clear that a customer who buys the meal from us and prepares it at home does so less expensively than if they go to a restaurant to do it; or whether it is driven by focus on their family, wanting to have family time as we talked a little last quarter that there are significant social implications of having dinner at home with your kids that is getting some attention, and we suspect that and just the general social trend maybe is having some impact. And then you get to the question of gas which you described, which is given the cost of gas, customers may be traveling less, wanting to combine trips in a nearby location, we're more convenient. We have gas, all of those combinations work together so they shop with us. I suspect that's also true. Where gasoline is 10% lower in our supermarkets this year than last year, that's meaningful, but it is still a fairly high number. Customers still have that as a budget issue they need to worry about. In my judgment at least, we're still getting some benefit from high cost of fuel in the minds of the customers and I think it is showing up in our sales.  I think probably and I have answered this I think earlier on some of the earlier questions. I think the biggest contribution to our sales really has to do with our strategy. The steps that we've taken, the alignment we have with our customer, the commitment our associates have made to that. If you go out to our stores, our associates are on fire. They are remarkable in the way in which they are thinking about customers and trying to meet the needs of those customers, and I couldn't be any more happy about that.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Wonderful.
Rodney McMullen: One other comment on your question to Dave, if you look at our identical sales growth usually almost every quarter somewhere along the line we end up talking about how much of that is driven by count and how much of it is driven by average basket, and we continue to see it very balanced between growth between counts, so with new people shopping in our stores and the average basket size, and it was slightly more on the count side than the basket side, but it is pretty close to 50/50 and has been for the last two or three quarters.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: My final question is about general merchandise. Clearly you guys have put much more emphasis on general merchandise and we're coming into the holiday period. Could you just talk about what kind of trends you've seen recently? Is general merchandise getting traction in your grocery stores and how are you feeling about what's going on happen in your business that are more focused on general merchandise.
Rodney McMullen: We are quite bullish on our general merchandise for a whole lot of reasons. We are seeing some traction. We're seeing improved quality of the products we're buying which comes from the hard work here, those in general merchandise here at our general office and the help of those out at Fred Meyer. The combination of that has really worked magic on both the selection of what we get, the quality of the assortment, the pricing on it, the costs, all of that is working to our advantage, and we're quite pleased with what we've seen there. I would have to say we're bullish.  You mentioned and I don't want to miss this opportunity. You mentioned the Fred Meyer Jewelers, and even though that doesn't go into our supermarket GM sales, I should point out this is their season to shine, and I just happen to have their website handy for you. It is www.fredmeyerjewelers.com. If you go there, there is still time to order jewelry for this holiday season.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Good morning, everyone.
Rodney McMullen: Hi, Chuck.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Did you say you expect to come in at the low end of your CapEx spending range for this year?
Rodney McMullen: Yes, Chuck.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: What's that range again?
Rodney McMullen: $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: In looking at some of the specific things that you've reported so far, if we start with fuel margins, you suggested that they were a little better than normal. Can you quantify that for us?
David Dillon: Well, let's see. They were a little bit better than last year in dollars. Last year was good, though, was quite strong in the third quarter, but as we pointed out, while it was strong in the quarter, year-to-date was more normalized. That's important to recognize with fuel because our customers need fuel, and we have lots of short-term fluctuation around the margins and even around the pricing and around the sales, but long-term we think it is a good investment. It was important in the quarter. Do you want to add anything more?
Rodney McMullen: You said it a little bit, Dave, but if you look at margin per gallon in the third quarter it was actually a little bit lower than the third quarter of last year, but because of our gallons were so strong, the margin dollars more than made up for that.
David Dillon: That's a good point. I am glad you made that.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: So penny profit per gallon down a bit but gallons drove the thing.
Rodney McMullen: Yes. With that said, as Dave said, if you look at the quarter relative to long-term trend, margins were certainly higher than a long-term trend but you have to look at gas margins over a longer period of time.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Okay. You mentioned when you're discussing selling gross margin that shrink, advertising, distribution, were all areas of cost that could be improved. Is that going to be improved through programs or are you talking about levering it because of the sales momentum or both?
David Dillon: It is really both of that. Shrink, we were challenged a little in the quarter but we're certainly improved if you look year-to-date. We still see lots of opportunity remaining and not just the leverage of higher sales. We keep trying to balance that, with making sure with don't put out our sales trend by trying to reduce shrink. You can get shrink to zero, but you wouldn't like the results.
Rodney McMullen: If you look at actually some departments we had increase in shrink, and it was part of the planned program of adding variety, so you really do have to break it down category by category in terms of looking at where we are and where we're trying to go.
David Dillon: I would say in every one of those categories you listed, though, we see opportunities in addition to what the leverage of sales does.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: In looking at acquisitions, how would you describe the environment right now, and is it perhaps a better time to be looking at more than just buying small store groups? Do you see any economics looking more attractive for buying a whole other division to get you into a new market perhaps?
David Dillon: The market on acquisitions isn’t different than the last couple of quarters we commented on.
Rodney McMullen: Not at all. As you know, we look at it a lot. We don't bid on too much, but we look at a lot. Any merger that we would do it would have to be something that's a quality asset with good management and good market share and a good economic model that's sustainable.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: No fixer uppers. 
Rodney McMullen: The only fixer uppers, if it is an end market where we are looking at a specific site, and just we want that corner and we already have a good reputation in the market.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Last question, if we look out a couple years, do you see Fred Meyer spreading outside of its current area?
David Dillon: Well, I don't know that I am going to comment on Fred Meyer, but I will comment on the resulting Marketplace store that has a direct outcome of our merger with Fred Meyer and the work we've done with Fred Meyer and our general merchandise folks here. We've put together this store which many of you have seen, and we have a number of them now around the country. We've now opened two in this market, in the Cincinnati market, and they are actually remarkable stores. They are much like a Fred Meyers store except that they aren't as big a store, and they don't have quite the same assortment in some of the other departments that Fred Meyer would have, and so for us that is a really good first step of taking the Fred Meyer advantage and expanding that elsewhere.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Thank you very much. Great quarter.
David Dillon: Thank you, Chuck.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I wanted to ask the acquisition question in a different perspective. I am not curious if you're actually pursuing anything but in your preference would you rather do one of three things: would you like to push competitors out of the market with your aggressive positioning in price, service, et cetera; or would you like to wait patiently for rationalization; or third, use that acquisition strategy in selectively end market to fill up your pipeline and build up greater density?
David Dillon: My lawyer is shaking his head saying we're not going to answer that question. Actually think about it this way, and I think this is accurate for us. The single biggest difference we've made in the last several years is to work on our plan, and to figure out what we wanted to have happen in our stores and how we wanted to connect with our customers. We have to be conscious of what happens with competition. We have to be conscious of what the playing ground looks like and who goes outs of business, who doesn’t, who is weak, who is connecting with our customers, who is doing better than us and those sorts of things.  But really, it has to be our game plan. Once you go down that path, you can have a natural thought process of what happens with acquisitions, for instance, and whether somebody falls out because they can't compete, whether they get purchased by somebody, all of those are the normal things that happen in any market that is in change. Our objective isn't so much causing one or another of those alternatives to happen, it's to play out our strategy the best way we can, and I believe all of those things will happen in different ways and at different times.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: That's fair. When you look at the whole bucket of your price and non-price investments, going forward is the balance of the actual dollar investments going to be fairly constant or are price investments actually more costly if you try to spread that out over service products and shopping experience and be more balanced as you said? Are there some of those investments still fairly constant or is that something where you can make more progress with your investments with fewer dollars?
David Dillon: When we were originally starting down this path, nearly 100% of what we were investing was in price. We gradually added other elements. First it had more to do with service and so forth, and now it is adding some other dimensions and it actually has capital investment dimensions today. We are intending to have it more balanced although the price will probably always be on people's minds because it is so easily calculated where some of the other things like training budgets and capital budgets and the way we do remodels and things like that aren't always as easily calculated.  I think you will continue to see us continue to invest more, proportionately more, in the other non-price areas than the price areas, but I doubt that we'll ever get to where it is no additional investment in price. I just don't imagine that at any time in the near term anyway.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Are those other areas equally as costly on a dollar basis when you add it all up at the end of the day?
David Dillon: For the benefit achieved?
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Exactly.
David Dillon: Actually that's hard to answer. They're harder to achieve, price is certainly easier to address because you simply make a decision to price something different. Helping your organization engage itself to figure out how you address customers and having our associates aligned in such a way they are seeing the customer strategy as their own rather than something that's handed out from some corporate office some place, that's a lot harder to do and takes a lot more organizational energy. How you put a cost around that, I am not sure. We see it as an opportunity as opposed to a cost, and so I don't know that we've really done the metrics the way you're thinking about it.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: How far along are we within the segmentation of the store base? Is there an X percent of the base that's been SKU value, upscale, mainstream, any metrics you're tracking on that?
Rodney McMullen: To me it is a great question, and to answer it you need to separate it into two parts. If you look at the initial part on segmentation, we're probably 80% or 90% of the initial process done. However, with that said, as we went through the process we identified a lot of additional opportunities, and when you look at the additional opportunities, we're probably only 20% or 30% along the way done on that, and hopefully as we learn more and more on segmentation with the help of Dunnhumby and Don's merchandising team, what we'll find is that continues to happen.  If you look at the initial project list, it is pretty well done, but out of that project list identified a lot of additional opportunities and that's what they're focused on getting done now. Pleased with a lot of additional opportunities there.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Great. Thanks. Good work.
Rodney McMullen: Jason, one other comment on your first question of today. I know we have pointed this out before, but if you look at our major markets, we still have almost 50% share in our market held by people out without our economies of scale, and how they ultimately fall out, time will tell, but clearly there is still a lot of market share held by people without our economies of scale and without our big competitors’ economies of scale.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Summers - Bear Stearns.
Bob Summers - Bear Stearns: With the comps you've been putting up it is fairly obvious you're gaining share. What I would be curious to know is, is there a specific type of competitor or retailer that you're gaining share from?  The second question is, in the markets where you're testing a generic initiative, could you talk about what you learned or observed so far and maybe frame the answer a little bit around the impact in margins, traffic levels, and service levels?
David Dillon: Let me take the second first and the answer is no. I actually can, but I am not going to. I don't think it would be useful, and it is a bit premature to do that anyway.  Let me go back to your first question about share and from whom we're getting it. A few years back, actually many years ago, we changed how we looked at market share, and we started looking at it from any place that customers could buy the goods that we sell, which then started including lots of things we previously had not measured.  I think the way in which I would answer the question where are we getting our sales? I think we're actually getting it from a variety of places. It isn't a single competitor. It isn't in a single market. It isn't in a single department. It isn't from any one single strategy of ours or any one single strategy of our competitors. It is a variety of all of those working together to achieve that.  I do suspect that we are picking up share. I think that's probably an accurate statement, but I do think we're bringing it in from all of the places that customers would buy products and not just any single source.
Rodney McMullen: I think some of it is really driven by trend changes that Dave talked about earlier. To be able to put a specific number on it is hard to say but clearly we get the feeling people are eating at home more, how much of that is driven by gas, how much of it is driven because people want to eat together as a family; that we don't know, but when you look at our deli business and some of the prepared meal areas, that business is doing very well. Certainly when you look at produce and nutrition that, as Dave mentioned on his remarks, that business is growing nicely and certainly that is a trend change where more and more customers are buying those types of products.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse. 
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter. There seems to be some saber rattling out of the USCW in Southern California. Can you give us an update on where we stand in the process right now and what we can expect as negotiations commence early next year?
David Dillon: The first thing I will tell you is that around any negotiations, Southern California or anywhere else, there is always a lot of public noise and I would encourage you, as I typically do, to disregard that because it doesn't necessarily tell you what's happening in that market. Southern California in particular, the contract expires the first part of March, and obviously I think it would come as no surprise that we see the contract in that market as a challenging market.  We are committed, though, to reach a fair and balanced solution, and I think what Rodney said in his prepared remarks is important for us to remember; is that in every contract negotiation we work to reach a balanced agreement that meets our cost efficiency objectives while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. It does require that kind of balancing, and we fully expect that that will be the approach, and we expect that will be the outcome in Southern California.  The actual bargaining in that process will likely start soon. My guess is next month, but those things, you never quite know for sure when it actually starts getting some traction, but it is a big market. There are seven locals, and it is an important market to us and it is an important market to other grocers, too. It is one we'll be paying quite a bit of attention to.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Tesco recently stated they're look to go spend about $2 billion in the U.S. over a five-year period which certainly seems like a lot of stores now. At your analyst meeting you stated that you always assumed Tesco would be in the U.S. and built your business model around this. Can you elaborate on that a bit?
Rodney McMullen: It is really in terms of what we believe Tesco is really good at and what we assumed from a pricing and service standpoint they would build in, and what type of things as we understand the customers in the U.S. that they want, making sure that we build our economic model around providing our customers what their wants and needs are with the understanding and belief that we would have to compete against Tesco. It really is as simple as that, and it is trying to make sure that we think we understand their economic model and how to compete against that and making sure that we listen and talk to our customers to deliver what they want.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin - Banc of America.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: Thanks. I wanted to revisit the rent expense issue because really it was partly due to the big surprise on the EPS, and so I know what you said, but you said there were also a lot of closures in the quarter. I was wondering how the present value of the lease could have been down? Were there credits in the quarter that could have pushed that number down or maybe just a little more clarity there would be great.
Rodney McMullen: It would have been closures that were in the third quarter of last year that drove that number up a little higher than the trend line, and this year we did not have very many in the third quarter of '06.
David Dillon: A good part of the improvement, Scott, compared to last year was last year was particularly high.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: Okay. As we go forward and look at this -- because expense was down like 16% in the quarter -- would you consider it very abnormal? How do we model this line going out forward? I look back over a three or four-year period and we never saw action like this.
Rodney McMullen: That delta is unusual, obviously. The change is unusual.
David Dillon: As you model it, I would look at it more in terms of a year-to-date number rather than just a quarter number. Obviously in each quarter you're going to have some swings just because of seasonality from the business from a revenue standpoint, but as you model forward I would look at a rolling four-quarter basis in terms of what you're modeling, and as I said, we continue to expect it to create some of the operating margin going forward.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: Right. And then following up on some of the questions asked, I asked a question in the last quarter about the investments, when are they going to stop and the answer was given that it is kind of hard to say. Looks like we're going to invest in price on an ongoing basis, so it seems like that changed a little bit. What in the quarter made you guys feel like you could change your strategy, at least to a degree, and back away from the price investing? It does seem like it did change from your last answer.
David Dillon: I don't think we backed away from price investment. I mean the way you described it implies that we're rolling back the other way. I don't think I actually see an end to the investments, maybe forever. I think we'll always be asking ourselves how do we want to invest on behalf of our customers to continue to be relevant in their minds. Sometimes it will be in price. Sometimes it will be in the other three keys, but generally the long-term will be in all of those areas, and yes the price investment in this particular quarter was a little bit less than what we had experienced in some other quarters, but in the last two years, for instance, if you just look at gross margin, we've had three other quarters where the investment in gross margin was a little bit less than it was in this last quarter, as I look at that. Now, we tend to look at selling gross, and I don't have that at the tip of my tongue so I can't answer it from that perspective, but I didn't see it as rolling back our price investment.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: I didn't mean rolling back, I meant more not as much. 
David Dillon: That's correct. It wasn't as much. That was deliberate. We said all along our plan all along was to try to focus on some of the other keys and to get some leverage from those as well. Those are longer term to get benefit from and so having started that several years ago, we believe we're starting to see some benefits from that, particularly from the shopping experience, but those things we think are a little slower burn so we had to let them have a little time before they started to give us benefit.
Rodney McMullen: As Dave mentioned before and as we mentioned in the second quarter, some of the investments that we made in the second quarter we originally planned to do those investments in the third and fourth quarter.
David Dillon: That's a good point. If we had done that as we originally planned, it would look a little more balanced for the year.
Rodney McMullen: A little smoother when you look at quarter to quarter. Obviously when you look at the year, it will be consistent with what we've said, is that we would expect to invest in selling growth as we reduce costs and be able to pay for that.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: The OG&A line seems to have not improved as much as we've seen. The trend is still improving, but not as much. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on what you saw on that line and the difference between the second quarter and third quarter?
David Dillon: First in OG&A I would remind you that some of our reinvestment with our customer goes into categories that would hit OG&A, and we have not attempted to quantify that in any public way. So because it does, don't read too much into it being 17 basis points versus last quarter being 47, just as an example. There are some things that go in quarter to quarter over time and tend to even out a bit, but there are some anomalies in individual quarters that can make it look a little odd.  From an OG&A point of view, some of the things we saw in the quarter we of course saw a significant sales leverage, and that sales leverage on lots of expense lines. We also saw progress in healthcare, as Rodney pointed out. Some of that was due to sales leverage, and some of that was due to progress in some selected plans where we had planned design changes. In that particular area, we must continue to address it to be competitive, though, because it is an area where our costs are noticeably higher than many of our competitors.  Some of the challenges in the quarter included pension and credit card fees are two of the best examples. We talked about both of those pretty regularly, and those did work against us in the quarter, and so we have some of those challenges as well. Rodney, do you want to add anything?
Rodney McMullen: When you look at the last eight quarters as I mentioned, we had declining OG&A in the last eight quarters when you look at it without stock option expense and some of the miscellaneous unusual items. The 17-basis point decline is better than five of the other quarters out of the last eight, so there were only two quarters in the last eight better than the 17 basis points. When you look at it overall, we feel real good about 17 basis points and what it sets us up to continue to do in the future.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
David Dillon: Thank you, Scott. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Todd Duvick - Banc of America. 
Todd Duvick - Banc of America: Good morning. Just a couple quick questions here. First of all, on the cash flow statement it looks like there was a pretty big negative variance in the cash flow for the quarter. It looks like most of it was attributable to a build in the working capital. Could you address that, and especially from the standpoint of what we might expect going forward?
David Dillon: When you look at obviously we have a lot of build up of inventory just from a seasonal standpoint, because of the holidays in November and December, so a good chunk of that is just build up for the inventories for the season. The other impact on the year-to-date cash flow statement would be the amount of cash taxes that we paid so far this year is quite a bit higher than last year, so it is really those two parts. There isn't anything on the inventory that causes us to be uncomfortable. Obviously as our identical sales has been very strong, we need to make sure we have product in the store to support that, and we feel good about the holiday season in that regard.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America: Not to beat a dead horse here, but just on the acquisition question again, I guess from a bit of a different angle and I appreciate you saying again how you're committed to your investment grade rating and we can't hear that enough, but just with respect to any large-scale acquisitions, if you were to take a look at that with respect to Fred Meyer, I think when you did the Fred Meyer acquisition, you paid a lot with equity, but that was also at a time when the stock had a little more momentum than it's had the last couple of years. I am just wanting to know if you can give us a sense for were you to bid on a large acquisition how you might be able to finance that and how the investment grade rating factors in there?
Rodney McMullen: The investment grade rating is, as you know, as we said several times is very important to us, and anything that we do we look at it in that regard. To say we won't do something or we will do something without knowing what it is that we're doing would be always obviously hard to answer. Investment grade rating we believe it is very important, and we believe it is very important because we believe it creates the lowest cost of capital, and it creates the financial flexibility to deal with the marketplace whatever happens and whatever opportunities that comes before us. As you know, when we merged with Fred Meyer, we were very willing to use stock to finance part of that merger. What a specific one is in the future, I would not really want to speculate to guess on that at this point.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America: But it is possible that you might be willing to use equity again if it made sense, if the acquisition was large enough so it is not something you wouldn't consider, I guess?
Rodney McMullen: On anything you look at all the pieces of the puzzle, and obviously investment grade is very important. Obviously creating shareholder value is very important and looking at all the pieces, what kind of synergy opportunities are created, and what's the resulting expectation from that.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
David Dillon: Thank you. Before we sign off today, I would like to make some additional comments to our associates listening in today.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2006 Kroger company earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like the turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Carin Fike. Please proceed.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com.  Before I turn the call over to Mr. Dillon, I want to take a moment to remind you about our upcoming investor conference here in Cincinnati on October 10th and 11th. We look forward to seeing many of you at the conference. Now I would like the introduce Mr. Dillon.
David Dillon: Thanks, Carin and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's second quarter financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman; Donnie McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I would like to begin by briefly reviewing Kroger's second quarter financial performance and then I'll provide an update on Kroger's outlook for 2006. Rodney will share additional details about our second quarter results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Total sales for the second quarter increased 9.2% to $15.1 billion. Identical supermarket sales increased 7.9% with fuel, and 6.0% without fuel. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel. As we have said, our business model is driven by identical sales growth, and we are pleased to achieved by identical sales growth, and we are pleased to achieved another strong quarter. Growth continues to be broad based across all divisions and all store departments. It was particularly strong in grocery, produce, natural foods, deli, bakery and pharmacy. Our convenience stores had another strong quarter in fuel and in non-fuel merchandise. Net earnings were $209 million, or $0.29 per diluted share for the second quarter. These results included $0.01 per diluted share related to stock option expense. Net earnings in the same period last year were $196.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share. We're pleased by this improved performance and believe it reflects our unique approach to serving our customers.  Our results this quarter indicate we are realizing the benefits of our strategy which includes listening to our customers and associates. Where investing our resources in what they tell us is most important, an approach that builds loyalty to Kroger. These results also illustrate the balance our strategic plan requires: sales, earnings, focus on our customers, and cost control. These results show our strategy is building sustainable sales and earnings growth and value for our shareholders. In looking at Kroger's performance during the first two quarters of fiscal 2006, total sales increased 8.6% to $34.6 billion. For the same period identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.8%. Net earnings for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 were $515.4 million or $0.71 per diluted share. These results included $0.03 per diluted share for stock option expense. They also included $0.03 per diluted share for legal reserves recorded in the first quarter. For the same period in fiscal 2005 net earnings were $490.7 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Kroger's results through the first half of 2006 indicate we are on track to exceed our original identical sales guidance and meet our earnings guidance for the year. We are affirming our guidance for earnings per share growth in 2006 of 6% to 8% including the increase in legal reserves recorded during the first quarter which essentially raised our guidance. Without this increase, Kroger's projected earnings per share growth would be 9% to 11% for fiscal 2006. As we often mentioned, strong identical sales are a key driver of our earnings per share growth. We originally forecasted identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales in excess of 3.5% for fiscal 2006. When we reported our first quarter results, we raised that guidance to approximately 4.5% for the year.  Today, thanks to dedicated efforts of our associates and their emphasis on placing the customer first, we are raising our identical sales guidance once again. We now anticipate identical supermarket sales of at least 4.0% for the balance of the year, or approximately 4.9% for the full year, excluding fuel. I want to remind investors that in 2005 several markets experienced unexpected sales increases as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result, it is difficult to forecast this year's identical sales for the same period. Our entire organization remains focused on driving sustainable, identical sales growth. Now I will ask Rodney to share some additional details on Kroger's second quarter results. 
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned earlier, we believe our second quarter performance is a direct result of our strategy and reflects the consistent approach we have taken to managing our business; balancing investments aimed at improving our customer's shopping experience with operating cost reductions. I would like to discuss how this strategy affected several indicators during the second quarter, starting with gross margin.  FIFO gross margin was 23.47% of sales, a decrease of 112 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2005. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 65 basis points from the prior year. In the past two quarters we have introduced you to a metric we call selling gross margin. This is the term we use internally at Kroger to describe the Company's gross margins before incurring expenses directly related to distributing and merchandising products on our store shelves such as advertising, warehousing, transportation, and shrink. Kroger's second quarter selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 65 basis points. During the quarter we made additional targeted investments in select markets to take advantage of market share opportunities. These investments account for a portion of the decline in our second quarter selling gross margin.  Operating general and administrative costs declined 73 basis points to 17.5% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations and stock option expense, OG&A declined 47 basis points. We've made good progress as an organization in controlling costs in an inflationary environment. I would like to highlight three areas in particular: bag costs, transportation management, and our collective efforts in controlling utility costs. We saw a decrease in bag usage, thanks to the efforts of our front line associates. With regard to transportation costs, we achieved higher sales with lower mileage by better utilizing our truck fleet. In terms of kilowatt hours, our team was successful in significantly reducing usage by installing energy efficient lighting and introducing other energy savings improvements in our stores to offset increasing utility costs. These three examples reduced costs and benefit the environment.  In fact, since 2000, Kroger has reduced our overall energy consumption per square foot by more than 19%. This is the kind of cost control that allows us to invest in improving the shopping experience and lowering prices for our customers. We can give you several other examples but wanted to highlight a few to help you understand some of the changes going on within our business. Rent expense in the second quarter was $153.4 million, an increase of $8.9 million over the prior year. Excluding closed store activity, we continue to expect rent expense as a percent of total sales to decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on owning the real estate. Kroger's operating margin on a GAAP basis declined 17 basis points to 2.96% of sales. Excluding the effects of retail fuel sales and stock option expense, operating margins declined 5 basis points. On this same basis, recall that our first quarter operating margin grew 32 basis points. This illustrates what we have told you to expect concerning our operating margin on a quarter by quarter basis. That is, it may fluctuate depending on the timing of our operating cost savings and our reinvestment of those savings in the customer's shopping experience. On a year-to-date basis, Kroger's operating margin declined 15 basis points to 3.16% of sales. Excluding the effects of retail fuel sales, the first quarter increase in legal reserves and stock option expense, operating margins increased 16 basis points. On this basis, for fiscal 2006 we still forecast slightly improving operating margins resulting primarily from continued improvements in California. During the quarter, Kroger's strong cash flow enabled us to invest in our store base, reduce debt, repurchase shares, and pay a cash dividend. In the second quarter, capital investments totaled $361.2 million compared to $271.9 million a year ago. We are on track to invest approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in capital projects during our fiscal year 2006. We still anticipate total supermarket square footage growth of 1.5% to 2% before acquisitions and operational closings. For the second quarter total supermarket square footage grew 1.4% year-over-year excluding acquisitions and operational closings. Our return on asset measure improved almost 80 basis points on a pre-tax basis. This is using the method Kroger has consistently used to calculate return on assets.  Net total debt was $6.3 billion, a reduction of $679.1 million from a year ago and a reduction of $2.5 billion since January 2000. Net total debt includes a reduction of $666.1 million to reflect temporary cash investments. Total debt was $7 billion, a reduction of $263 million from a year ago.  As we've mentioned before, our investment grade rating is very important to us. We have focused on improving our coverage ratios since merging with Fred Meyer in 1999. Our net total debt to EBITDA ratio in the second quarter was 1.87. This is our best performance on this measure since our merger with Fred Meyer in 1999, and in fact our best since Kroger's leveraged recapitalization in 1988.  During the second quarter Kroger repurchased 7.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $21.40 for a total investment of $161.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, $389.3 million remained under our $500 million stock buyback announced in May of 2006. Since January 2000, Kroger invested $3.3 billion to repurchase 170 million shares at an average price of $19.26 per share. This equates to approximately 19% of the Company. Kroger expects to continue to buy back stock in 2006 in accordance with the Company's financial strategy of using one-third of free cash flow for debt reduction and two-thirds for share repurchase and a cash dividend payment. As Dave mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% in 2006. This range includes the first quarter charge of $0.03 per diluted share to increase our legal reserves. Even though that additional legal reserve was not expected when we gave our original guidance. Fiscal 2006 is also a 53-week year. As we look to fiscal 2007, we continue to anticipate earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% on top of the 2006 base that I just described. In other words, the 6% to 8% growth for 2007 should be applied after reducing fiscal 2006 earnings by a net of $0.02 per diluted share. This net adjustment to 2006 earnings reflects the $0.05 benefit from the 53rd-week offset by the $0.03 of additional legal expense.  This is the same guidance we communicated for 2007 earnings per share growth when we released year end 2005 results in March. We wanted to clarify it to ensure consistency in the treatment of two unique items in our fiscal 2006 results. The additional legal accrual that occurred in the first quarter and the 53rd week that will occur in the fourth quarter. Our second quarter tax rate was 38.2% compared to 37.4% for the prior year. We expect that our tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be 37.8%, slightly higher than our original guidance at the beginning of the year. The year-to-date tax rate is slightly higher than the expected annual rate. This is because the work opportunity tax credit has not been approved but we anticipate it will be retroactively reinstated by year end. This tax credit will not be reflected in our effective tax rate until it is approved. Before I turn it back over to Dave, I would like to comment briefly on labor. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not face the magnitude of contract negotiations this year that we did last year. Still, labor negotiations continue to be a challenge in the face of competitive pressures, rising pension and healthcare costs. In each contract negotiation we will work to reach a balanced agreement that meets the needs of our cost reduction and containment objectives while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. This balance will allow Kroger to invest in our business to create new job opportunities for existing associates and hire some more people. Now I will turn it back to Dave for closing remarks.
David Dillon: Rodney, thank you. Our second quarter results show we are on track to achieve our financial objectives for the year. In keeping with our strategic plan, our results this quarter demonstrate our ability to invest cost savings to enhance our customers' overall shopping experience. We thank our associates for maintaining their focus on our customers. We will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets. 
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Good morning. You mentioned on the topic of gross margins that a portion of the gross margin decline was pricing investment. What was the rest?
Rodney McMullen: The overall decline would have been pricing investments through every day pricing and promotional pricing. However, the comment that I mentioned in some markets we accelerated our price reductions because of some opportunities for market share in some selected markets, and that's the part that we accelerated.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Okay. I wonder if you could explain the rent situation. Rent was up, but in Q1 rent was down. Can you just go over that?
Rodney McMullen: The majority of the rent increase was because of the present value from closing a few stores, and it is just the present value of the lease obligation. That shows up all in rent expense in the quarter that you present value the rent. It is the net of what we expect to collect from the rent versus what we're paying in rent.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: Just one last question for David. If you hold to the thesis, David, that the U.S. consumers is tightening the belt a bit, what have you been doing to prepare your company for that?
David Dillon: I think the actually there are several trends that we're seeing or at least have read about and since may be going on, and tightening the belt relates to a couple of those trends. Let me maybe identify those and talk briefly about them because it ties very closely to the strategy we have at Kroger.  The three trends that we've seen, the first is that at a supermarket is costs a lot less to prepare a meal for a family than to go to a restaurant, either to go to a restaurant or go and pick up food and bring it home, which has been a trend that has increased for a number of years. We think that that may be if not reversing, certainly changing a bit, because it is quite true that a family can be fed much more economically at the supermarket. That being said, I suspect that that is what's happening in the environment where fuel costs are higher and people are feeling the pinch, and we certainly read a lot about that. Now, there is not a good way to empirically prove it, but that is one friend.  The second trend is with high fuel costs a lot has been said about people driving fewer miles, and if that is true, the convenience of Kroger as a nearby store is perfect, fits naturally into our sweet spot. We believe that is also occurring. A third trend that you probably haven't read as much about but we've read some things recently about is the trend towards families looking at the value of family meals together at home. In fact, if you're not familiar with it, you all ought to check this out because at the Columbia University there is a center there called the National Center For Addiction and Substance Abuse. They have done some significant research to identify that meals at home with family can go a long ways, that family time can go a long ways to reducing lots of issues for kids and families: drug usage, alcohol usage, performance in school as examples. One-way that CASA, which is what that center is called at Columbia University can help emphasize this -- and they started this a year or two ago I believe – is by emphasizing a Family Day which this year is going to be Monday, September 25th of '06. You will probably see a lot more stories even than you've seen already about their research, about their findings, and I actually think in a number of places around the U.S. that has begun to resonate among our customers.  So those three trends that we see all play to the natural strength not only of supermarkets but in particular of Kroger because at Kroger our strategy as you clearly know, I think, is that we're trying to grow sales; by growing sales it helps lower our costs. By lowering our costs, we reinvest in the shopping experience through a variety of things, not just the pricing that you mentioned, not just the promotions you mentioned, but also in other experiential things like faster checkout, things like lower out of stock, those kinds of elements.  That strategy we believe fits perfectly with these kinds of trends going on with the consumer today. Our pricing in particular positions us well given that the customer is a little more pinched both for money and also not wanting to spend the gasoline to drive a long way to get it. We think it is a natural for us, Perry.
Perry Caicco - CIBC World Markets: All right. Thanks, Dave.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: A couple of things, I wanted to drill down on gross a little bit more. If you take out the accelerated investments, was gross essentially in line with your budget or what you expected?
David Dillon: Very close. I would say in line overall.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: You said a portion. Would I be right in assuming the accelerated investments would be less than half of the decline in gross year-over-year?
Rodney McMullen: We wouldn't really want to get in that much specific detail, John.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Was the accelerated investments more shelf price or promotional activity?
David Dillon: It would be a mixture of both, and it really depends on the opportunity within a market.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Was it more proactive or reactive?
David Dillon: Proactive.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Okay. So I guess it would be your view that what we saw in the first half is more like what you ought to see on a regular basis, the first quarter may be a little under investment, second quarter over, and the combination of the two is more where you see things longer term?
David Dillon: I think, John, it is important to think about this in the longer term context. It is one of the reasons that we don't try to give guidance for each quarter because we're going to call each quarter as it goes through as we need to do. It is the year and the two years and that sort of long-term horizon that we're trying to balance out rather than look at any one individual quarter, and I think those two quarters together help illustrate that point.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: If you calculated ROI on the investments this quarter, is it too early to do that and are you satisfied with the ROI?
David Dillon: I am satisfied with the ROI first. But second is, to run a proper ROI in our business you need a longer time horizon than a quarter, and as a result, I don't think it is something we can actually do, but I am satisfied that we will be happy with that return when we can run the numbers.
Rodney McMullen: And Dave's point about looking at it longer term to me is absolutely correct. If you look at our longer term strategy in terms of where we're trying to go, this fits in perfectly with where we're trying to go, and it really, given the strong sales growth, we had the opportunity to make some investments a little earlier, and the cost reductions that we've achieved in the business, and we just took advantage of those opportunities because of the strength of the business.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Are you also investing in labor such that the decline of 47 basis points, it is actually better than that ex investments or, no, you're not making investment there?
David Dillon: We would be making investments in the shopping experience for the customer that would cause OG&A to be higher or that caused OG&A to be higher.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Finally, your contract or relationship with Dunnhumby, will Tesco have the ability given they're an owner here when they come into the U.S. to use Dunnhumby as well as or do you have a geographic exclusive?
David Dillon: It would have to be the Dunnhumby from the U.K. It could not be the Dunnhumby from the U.S. The learnings they would have here they would have to learn again.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: You're not at a disadvantage because of that, they're going to have to learn the U.S. consumer from scratch?
David Dillon: Correct.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Thanks.
David Dillon: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question will come from the lane of Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers. 
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Good morning, guys.
David Dillon: Good morning.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: I would like to start with question about whether you changed some of your promotions to emphasize fuel a little bit more and does that have some impact on reported sales for non-fuel? If you're putting promotions on the food side into fuel, does that mathematically make sales look stronger on the food side?
David Dillon: Meredith, we have a variety of promotions that tie inside the store to what you pay for fuel at the fuel pump. The cost of those promotions are charged against the sales inside the store. While you may receive a discount on what you spend per gallon of fuel, we charge that discount against the 6% ID we reported because what we're really trying to do with the promotion is drive inside store sales not necessarily fuel sales. The 6% sales ID sales that we reported would reflect the cost of those kinds of promotions, and the reduction of sales.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Got it. Okay. And they be I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the what's happening in the acquisition environment? Are you still seeing lots of opportunities, and has your appetite changed in any way?
David Dillon: We continue to see plenty of opportunities. It really hasn't changed, and our approach to it really hasn't changed, that we've talked about probably for the last ten years or so. We look at pretty much everything. We bid on a small percentage of what we look at, and we usually end up buying about half of what we bid on. Still an awful lot of folks out there think their assets are worth more than we do, and time will tell who is right or wrong on that.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: My final question is about Wal-Mart. They have said publicly they will slow down their fill-in growth in markets where they've operated for awhile, and we also have some information that says their food pricing may be going up. I think they still have the lowest prices in town, but maybe not as low, and I was just wondering if you have actually seen either of those things in the markets where you overlap with Wal-Mart?
David Dillon: I would say that's too early to tell on those points. Those would be recent developments, plus we're not likely to comment on specific trends that we see at a competitor anyway.
Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thanks, Meredith.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of FTN Midwest.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Good morning, everyone. As you're showing these strong comps, 6% in the most recent quarter, it generates leverages as you go through the quarter. How do you allocate, Dave, the price promotion investments into the various markets? What drives the process?
David Dillon: It is really based on an individual assessment of those markets by the people in the markets and the merchants both in the divisions and here at our general office. As Rodney pointed out as we went through the quarter, we saw additional opportunities. Those were identified in some cases from the individual divisions, sometimes it was here, and we addressed it. So it is really trying to read the business day-to-day and week to week and trying to read it both at the local level and at the general office level.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: So a strong division, it is getting more leverage than it can reinvest may see some of the cash flow directed towards market share growth opportunity in another division?
Rodney McMullen: It could be, or could be if the opportunity is there we'll push harder there, either way.
David Dillon: The other thing is not all the investments are growth. Some of it is in service. The service side really is driven by what our customers have told us is most important to them, and where we stand versus what they want, and what the cost of bridging that gap, so on a service side it is really driven by feedback from the customers in addition to what Dave talked about.
Rodney McMullen: We have a lot of metrics that help a local market understand how well they're coming across to the customer, and each market is trying to improve on those metrics, and so that's exactly right. In those markets, those decisions on investing end up typically being a local choice and a local decision.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Does the closure of the Albertsons breakup, did that affect some of the timing of promotion and investments in the second quarter?
Rodney McMullen: Not particularly.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: Okay. Switching a little bit to gas promotion, are you doing any specific promotions at the convenience stores, looking at them on a standalone basis?
Rodney McMullen: Well, we would in markets where we overlap with the supermarket, the supermarket would tie together with the promotional strategy on offering gas at C stores also. That would be the primary promotion. The other thing that their business is growing nicely is that it is really doing all the basics in terms of customer service and keeping the stores updated and adding variety and some of the other things. It is really both those pieces that's driving that business.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: All right. Now, is there anything you mentioned earlier that gas promotions do influence the sales because of the discounts. Any other metrics we should be aware of on that when you're using gasoline to promote in-store, and then further now we have some sharp fall off in gas prices. Are you seeing any trends that have developed since then or are you reducing gasoline promotions at all?
David Dillon: I can't think of any other metrics that we ought to comment on. None come to mind, anyway. I am not sure exactly what you're driving at. I don't think we're seeing any difference in what we're trying to do in gasoline given the cost change. It has dropped dramatically in the last week or two. In terms of actual data, I don't think we would report anything to shed on that anyway.  The one thing that's really worth noting is you will now clearly see, I think, certainly next quarter you will see the reasons that we have from the very beginning taken gasoline out of our numbers to show you what the numbers look like because if you leave them in there, you will get some very erratic results, and it will not be a meaningful picture of what's happening inside the business.
Rodney McMullen: On your question, Dave's last point really is in terms of your question is there anything else you should look at, that is the reason why we've been giving the numbers with and without fuel for the last five or six years is the very point that Dave just made.
David Dillon: It was our experience at the convenience stores which we've had for years -- actually decades -- that you have to be careful about fuel dollar sales in particular because they are so erratic, and that's the reason we started doing that in the very beginning because of the experience we had there, so we've learned a good lesson. I think that is probably the best advice I could give you is to look at the numbers without fuel to get a real sense of how things are going at Kroger.
Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin of Banc of America Securities.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Thanks very much. I was just wondering, do you guys have a number like promotional spending, how much of that is being tied to gas this stage?
Rodney McMullen: I don't think we would have anything like that that we would release publicly, no.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Great. Then just a couple more here. How much of the O&A improvement is being driven by labor savings?
David Dillon: That's a hard one. I am not sure I can dissect it that finely. We certainly know that some of the labor contracts have contributed to our ability to successfully reinvest for the experiences with our customers, but I think I would look at it as part of this overall strategy as we've been able to contain or reduce costs in labor or in healthcare or even reduce the rise of pension, even though it continues to go up, those areas as examples we see that as money that gets reinvested either back in additional training or back in the experience in the store or even in pricing in some way to improve on our overall sales which of course then drives additional labor hours. So the metric changes once again because then your labor usage goes up, but the dollars are being contained a little bit better. I don't know if there is a better way to look at it.
Rodney McMullen: One thing I would add is if you look at some of the improvement in OG&A is driven by lower total employee costs, but that reduction really is driven by productivity improvements from the sales leverage and just changing work processes. If you look at it on an average hourly rate basis, you would not see that. It really is productivity improvements from the higher identical sales growth and actually changing work process.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Rod, that's a great point. Is it fair to say that with a lot of the new contracts, renegotiated contracts you guys have signed we will actually start the cycle, I guess when it goes to California that the growth rate of that average hourly wage or total compensation has been held in check by the activity that you guys engaged in to renegotiate those contracts?
David Dillon: That would vary by each market. Some markets that would clearly be true. Other markets were not particularly high cost, and they might not quite be the same way you just described.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Dave's point really is it is a market by market basis, and it is what type of cost structures in the market currently, what kind of cost structure do we anticipate in the market because of competitive changes, and what's the wage rate that's competitive and fair for associates and how can we run our economic model? How can we manage those costs appropriately?
David Dillon: The balance that Rodney referred to in his earlier comments are not just words that we use to describe this. It is really genuinely what we mean. We are trying to balance what our associates need and deserve, with what we need in the business in order to be able to grow and build the business and give people good job assurance for the future and to hire more people and add more hours.  Overall it is a balance, and the challenges have typically been wages somewhat, healthcare definitely, pension definitely. Those areas have been the challenges in each negotiation. We have tried to address it for those particular locales when we have, under each contract. We've done it this year, in past years and expect to do it in future years too.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Thanks very much. One more quick one. As far as the gross margin goes, this is more as we look out, when I look back at my model we've seen some steady erosion in the gross margins that brought pricing down. I know it has been part of your strategy. Is there any end to this, or is this just something we should come to expect, gross margin is just going to deteriorate on an ongoing basis to be offset by some of the savings? Or do we at some point get through the majority of the investment and maybe not stabilize but we don't see it drift sharply lower?
David Dillon: If you don't mind, I will refer to it as an investment rather than erosion, but with either word, I think what we said I guess a couple years ago, we did invest without having the cost to support that, and that was initially. We said at that point we reached a point where we think we've made strong enough investment in price that we can grow these other elements of our business and as we grow them and as we reduce our costs, we will reinvest that money in either shopping experience kinds of items -- which we've mentioned things like training and improved out of stocks and faster checkout and that sort of thing -- or we'll invest it in pricing.  I think at least for the foreseeable future as we identify that just in the next year or so, we've said that our intent is to reinvest that in order to improve our sales, and that our sales strategy is essentially how we're going to grow our earnings. I think you can now see clearly our sales can grow higher than what I think many people may have thought, and we think the opportunity out there is enormous for us to grow those sales and we want to keep trying to do that.  We are trying to be very mindful, though, of paying the bill as we go. We're not trying to invest in price or in other things without be able to have the lower cost structure to provide for that so that we don't end up eroding our operating margins. That's important to our strategy, and that important change we made -- as I said, I think a couple years ago if I remember right -- and as we made that change, that was a significant statement on our part. In terms of the long term, I don't know. I am sure there will be an end. There obviously is some end. I don't know what that will be exactly. I know we drew the line by saying we're not going to let our operating margin drop further on the whole on the long run.
Rodney McMullen: Without fuel.
David Dillon: Without fuel, and that was an intentional statement.
Rodney McMullen: The other thing, Scott, is the plan that Dave has outlined talks about we are confident that that will generate solid shareholder return through that process and actually will create a competitor -- that Kroger will be even a stronger company than where we are today from our associates and customer's standpoint both.
Mike Schlotman: That's a good point. I sort of took that for granted and maybe shouldn't, and make sure we point that out. When we did the math on this model, and as we've developed it, we're sure it will lead to a good return for shareholders. That's essential. We can't embark on a model that does not produce that result.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. They were phenomenal sales results. Appreciate your time.
David Dillon: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Husson of HSBC. 
Mark Husson - HSBC: Good morning. I just wanted to be devil's advocate here and just say gas goes back to $2.30. You talked about some of the behavioral changes and notwithstanding the joys of cooking for my delightful children and cleaning up after them and maybe people do eat out a bit more and drive a few more miles and your gas promotion becomes a bit less of a [inaudible] if gas does go back to $2.30, what are you seeing in terms of attitude stuff to make you comfortable that you have created an unbeatable set of consumer advantages no matter what gas prices do?
David Dillon: The first thing I will tell you is the advice I have for you is teach your kids to clean up after themselves -- that's what we try to do in our household. I think you really raised a really good point is what happens now with gas dropping back down and does that change the overall attitude of the customer and the behavior? It is amazing. You watch people shopping today for gas, and they actually think that fuel costs are low, and their memory is remarkable. We were comparing notes the other day. I can actually remember paying $0.199 a gallon and filled up my Volkswagen for a $1.50 years ago. There was a price war in my hometown at that time.  Our perspective on fuel, I remember the $1 mark and how hard it was to get over that hurdle, and now the $2 mark and now we look at $2 at being cheap gas. I do think the human mind does tend to adjust rather quickly. However, having said that, the amount of money that a family has, even at $2 a gallon is less money than they had a couple years ago just because they have to spend that much on fuel. That fact, that's not something that's an attitudinal thing. That’s an actual fact. They either have the money or they don't. I think that's what has driven some of the behavior. It may moderate a little bit at $2 rather than $3 a gallon, but I don't think it is going to change radically. Even if it does, our overall strategy while I think we got an extra boost, perhaps a small boost anyway on what's happened with fuel prices, that is not the basis of our strategy. Our strategy really comes down to understanding what the customer wants and balancing price investment and shopping experience investment to be the place that customers actually prefer to buy their groceries. As a result, yes, we could lose a little bit of the steam that came from the gas, I suppose it is possible. It is certainly possible because it was possible that we got it. On the other hand, it is not the sole reason for the sales growth we're getting. Our strategy, I think, is paying off and it is a measurable part of what we're doing. 
Rodney McMullen: I was going to say the other thing is our associates have really done a good job on improving what's within the store, and when you come out for the investor conference you will see some of those improvements, that it really is our merchandising team, our division operations team working together with our store associates and improving that experience. Hopefully a lot of customers have come into our stores because of fuel costs will decide to stay because you can save two-thirds versus going out to a restaurant for a meal that's just as good or better.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Just on the gas margin side it seems to me probably this last quarter given the shape of the pricing drop, the gas margins probably weren't all that great. Can you remind us what happened in the post-Katrina period last year on gas margins?
Rodney McMullen: Last year in the third quarter our gas margins were noticeably strong. In the second quarter we just finished, also our gross margins were noticeably strong.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Okay. And then finally just a question for Mike. With interest rates falling, what have you done with your discount rates for your PBO and what effect has that had on the P&L account?
Mike Schlotman: We changed that annually, and last year end we actually reduced the interest rate for the discounts of both future obligations and of the investment. The annual amounts that we're charging to the income and expense this year isn't dramatically different between the two years, year-on-year and the Company sponsored plan. Some of that is because we've funded the plan to a higher stake than it's been in the past. We put the incremental dollars in and the way FASB 87 works, even though I have higher liability amount, the year I put the cash in, for every year I am assuming I am earning 8.5% on the return, and that reduces my book pension expense.
Mark Husson - HSBC: So the dollars are not actually meaningfully different?
Mike Schlotman: Not meaningfully.
Mark Husson - HSBC: That's all. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jason Whitmer of Cleveland Research. 
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Good morning. You spent a lot of time talking about proactive investments, a lot of money that's going out. How about within your cost reduction, some of your internal efforts to save money? Has that alternated? I know you say that can change from quarter to quarter within a given year, but as far as actual dollars and maybe versus your own expectations, how do you think you're tracking in the whole sum of the bucket?
David Dillon: I think we're tracking well. We described the cost efforts before this way, and it is still exactly the same. Every time we think we reached the pinnacle of a mountain, we look out in the distance and we see the next mountain. We continue to see new opportunity after new opportunity after new opportunity, and they are many of them, now some are big, but many are actually small, just a lot of them, and we're working on many of those as we go through the organization. We're trying to pick the one that is make the most sense, work through those and work to the next, and that's actually one of reasons we don't try to quantify an absolute dollar amount is that I don't think we're ever going to be satisfied on that metric. I think we're always going to believe that there are additional savings out there that can be reinvested in some way that would be of benefit to our shareholders and our to customers, and we're going to try to do that. I don't know if that answers your question.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Within something like shrink, which has been a big dollar category and you made a lot of progress on it, do you still see a lot of opportunity out there? How are you tracking on things like that versus your expectations on a quarter-to-date, year-to-date or last 18 months?
David Dillon: Let's take as an example Rodney pointed out that the decline in FIFO gross margin was 65 basis points, and that our decline in selling gross margin was 65 basis points. Those two being the same numbers suggest that we were pretty neutral on the expenses within gross margin.  Now, those are not in OG&A, but we look at them and deal with them just like they're in OG&A, and those expenses include things like advertising and shrink and warehouse and transportation. As an example, we did not make as much progress in shrink this second quarter as what we had hoped we would make, and in part that was our own doing because we made some decisions on merchandising that we knew would increase our shrink and as a result it did. So we had to be careful about setting goals that would hurt ourselves. So as we're tracking on that item, I would say I am not particularly satisfied with shrink right now, but in another area, warehouse and transportation, transportation costs obviously the fuel costs are much higher, but because we ran fewer miles to produce the sales, and the way we accomplished that was hard work on the part of our logistics team, and because our warehouses performed particularly strongly, we ended up with better results there. We're targeting and progressing well on our metrics on that item. Those are just a few examples.
Rodney McMullen: Jason, I guess when I look at it overall, we're very pleased with where we are where we thought we would be when you put all the cost reduction efforts together. It really is everybody working together, and you can give examples -- Dave and I and Don and the rest of us could go on forever on giving examples, some small, some big, but it adds up to a meaningful amount. Even with that said, we still see meaningful opportunities to continue to improve from where we are.
David Dillon: I think that's the main point is that I got trapped in the details of some individual examples, but those individual examples illustrate exactly what Rodney said is that this is made up of individual items taken one at a time and collectively they produce a picture. The picture that we see so far collectively is very bright, and we're very optimistic and pleased both with the sales. We're pleased with the leverage they have given us. We're pleased with the reduction in our OG&A costs. We're pleased with the reduction or cost containment of those expenses embedded in gross. We're pleased in the way in which we have reinvested to benefit our customers, and we're pleased that the customers keep coming back and repaying us and that's how re ended up with those identical sales.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: When you look at bigger picture ideas to further shave off costs wherever in your organization, do you see any major infrastructure changes that are needed to address in meeting your customer needs either at corporate or store level?
David Dillon: We have discussed a number of changes in the organization, one that we actually talked about on this call before and talked about publicly is for example we have shifted more of the buying over the last several years, more of the buying to one central location. It has two benefits. One is it gets the benefit of leveraging the numbers so you don't have to have quite as much resource applied to the issue.  Second it allows you to put significant intellectual pressure on that particular point that you could not afford to do if you tried to do that in 17 divisions, so things like that we have done. We have been doing those now for a number of years. I can't think of anything particular right now that we would want to announce on this call.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Sure. Last two small questions, one, maybe is for Mike. What is the actual dollar impact of those closed stores on rent? Any major mix shifts going on that would help gross margin dollars but hurt the percentage?
Mike Schlotman: What was your last question?
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Any mix shifts within the stores that would be impacting the percentage but not as much on the dollars for gross?
Mike Schlotman: The rent expense that was a little over $6 million of it was the NPV of the closed stores, and I was looking through my papers to say get that answer even though Dave asked for your question twice.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Sure. Any major mix shifts within the stores or the regions that is putting a dent on your percentage gross margin but helping on you the gross dollars?
Mike Schlotman: I am not sure I understand. Mix shift?
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Any drags on your percentage from gross margin from any mix shift in categories or divisions?
Mike Schlotman: Categories, I can't think of any in particular other than the obvious one of fuel, and we take that out for purposes of evaluation.
Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Could you give us your thoughts on the acquisition side in terms of end market deals versus something larger on the new market side?
Rodney McMullen: In terms of historically we have been much more focused on end market to improve existing share. As a general rule that would be our focus. Now, as you know when we merged with Fred Meyer in 1999 that was obviously out of market. If something was out of market, it would have to be somebody whose culture was very similar to ours, with very strong store operations and market share before we'd ever consider it, and it would have a different standard than what we looked at in market. It wouldn't be any different from what we merged in Fred Meyer. What we saw was so beneficial to merge with Fred. Those are the characteristics that would have to exist.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Great. And that could you just talk a little bit more detail in terms of what's developed in some of your markets that you think has given you the opportunity to get more aggressive on price?
David Dillon: Sometimes it is more aggressive on price. Sometimes it is more aggressive on other things in the store like we mentioned on improving out of stocks or speed of checkout or training as examples. I think what it is is we see the opportunity in a market. If we see the opportunity for better sales, either a competitor who is weak or a competitor who is strong, either one of those situations might call for a little stronger investment. If they're strong, it is a competitor reaction, if they're weak, it is not a competitive reaction so much as it is trying to take advantage of the situation.  We feel our way as we go and markets you can tell that a little by what's happening with the sales. You get a sense of it from your customers. You get just a sense at the ground level from the people locally what they sense is going on in those markets. That's really how we make those choices.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Given that you are more proactive, then it is more taking advantage of a competitor you think is weak?
David Dillon: In both cases -- we actually have examples of both, I think it is proactive also in the sense that we made the decision rather than for instance a price war starting someplace and we're simply reacting to that. I would even view it as proactive if we had strong competitors if where he decided that we were going to firm up our position or strengthen our position or even reduce the decline if we had a declining situation. That could be proactive as well. When we talk about reactive is when someone else starts a price war or promotional price war or something along those lines.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: In this situation it could be a weak or strong competitor depending on the market.
Rodney McMullen: Yes.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: In terms of this accelerated investment, can we expect this to continue throughout the rest of the year at this pace or does that really change quarter to quarter?
David Dillon: It changes quarter to quarter first. All we're really forecasting for you is where the sales look like they will be and where we think the earnings per share are going to be and the operating margin for the year. Those are the givens, and within that we'll read it as we go through the quarters.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Lastly, would you care to comment just on the markets where you do see this opportunity or are taking the opportunity?
David Dillon: We typically don't talk about individual markets and would not choose to do so today. That's really just for competitive reasons.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. I wanted to ask with the consumer tightening the belt a little bit here, have you seen the consumer buying more on promotion and are they accepting higher priced package food costs that have been rolling through?
David Dillon: Let's see. With consumer tightening their belt, I don't know that we've seen a particular significant change in promotional buying on the part of the customer, but I will let Don comment on that in just a second and also ask Don to comment on what we're seeing in terms of cost increases and the ability to pass those through. 
Donnie McGeorge: On the CPG cost increase front, let me first say in the second quarter as we internally track our grocery commodities, which would be largely where the CPG influence would be, our internal measures suggest that we had less than 1% inflation, and we did have some cost increases and of course we had to buy them as usual as well. We do pass on those increases, and sometimes obviously in market by market you may be more successful in others.  But one of the things that I think is a tremendous benefit that should be understood is as a manufacturer which we are, a significant manufacturer, and we produce our own corporate brands as you know, we've got a very good working knowledge of what the cost components, if you will, of products are. And if we get what we consider ton unjustified cost increases, then we do certainly take advantage of it with our own corporate brands. Sometimes CPG's will pass on cost increases and then kind of read the market, judge their own volume, and reaction to it and often will either increase allowances later or maybe even rescind increases they previously had done if they're not satisfied with their volume. In some ways I would not characterize the second quarter as being anything particularly unusual. We didn't see anything that would cause us to suggest that the increases we're seeing are not any more or less different than it has been before.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Can you shed any light on how much of the 6% comp was traffic versus ticket?
Donnie McGeorge: It was some of both.
David Dillon: It was pretty balanced between the two.
Donnie McGeorge:
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
David Dillon: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Todd Duvick of Banc of America Securities.
David Dillon: Todd, hi, and we're going to make you the last question if that's all right.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Securities: That's great. I appreciate it. Congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask not to sound like a broken record here, but just on the acquisition front again, I think you have been fairly clear in terms of your acquisition appetite looking primarily at in-market acquisitions, but I am wanting to know if the case of a transformational acquisition like a Fred Meyer, how you balance that type of acquisition with your investment grade rating and if you would potentially use equity in that type of situation?
Rodney McMullen: To give complete specifics, you can never do that until you're in that situation. As you know and as we've said over the last several years our investment grade rating is very important to us, and it is important to us just in terms of the financial flexibility it gives you to deal with any situation. That hasn't changed. It has been true and will continue to be true at the investment grade rating is very important.  To say specifically how we would finance some kind of merger until you actually get to that point it is really hard to say how you will do it, because you may be merging with somebody that wants cash, and you have to address it accordingly.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Securities: Right. Suffice it to say that transformational acquisitions are probably secondary in terms of your appetite at this point?
David Dillon: I would never call it secondary. I can tell you when we merged with Fred Meyer up until a couple of months before that we really hasn't give it a lot of thought, and when we started sitting down and talking, it moved pretty quickly. To say that it is not top of mind today but tomorrow that could change because the world changes.  What you should feel assured of from Kroger's standpoint is to understand one that our investment grade rating is important; and, two, to the extent that we would do any merger it would have to satisfy all the same things that Fred Meyers did in terms of causing us to grow in a way we weren't able to grow before and have the right type of culture to merge with a group of companies. It would have all those same characteristics.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Securities: Okay, and one other point on this SuperValu prior to buying a large chunk of the Albertsons franchise, also talked about this commitment to the investment grade rating and it seemed to be a once in a lifetime opportunity. I know you can't say for certain, can you respond in terms of would there be a situation, once in a lifetime opportunity, that could present itself that may actually prove to be a higher priority than the investment grade rating?
David Dillon: To give that you specific answer, Todd, I don't think we could. The thing I would suggest is look at our track record over the last ten or fifteen years in terms of the importance of the investment grade rating and the things we've done along the way to be sure we've tried to maintain it and improve our coverage ratios. I would really point to look at our track record rather than answering a specific question going forward.
Todd Duvick - Banc of America Securities: I understand that. Thank you very much.
David Dillon: Todd, thank you and before we sign off today, I would like to make some additional comments to our associates who are listening in today. Rodney mentioned the progress we made this quarter in controlling energy costs in such a challenging environment. He specifically mentioned bag expense, trucking costs and energy usage. He could have also mentioned many others.  Fortunately, we can point to thousands of individual efforts our associates make every day to benefit our customers. From taking a customer's groceries to their car when they need a little extra help to a team of facility engineers who find the right lighting solutions, our people look for opportunities where they can individually make a difference towards placing our customers first.  Efforts like these and thousands of others make our business strategy work, so on behalf of our customers, we deeply appreciate your work. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2006 Kroger Company’s earnings conference call.  My name is Janelle and I will be your audio coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Carin Fike. Please proceed, ma’am.
Carin Fike: Thanks, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today’s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Dillon.
David Dillon: Thanks, Carin and good morning, everyone. We are pleased you could join us to review Kroger’s first quarter financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s Vice-Chairman; Don McGeorge, Kroger’s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to begin this morning by briefly reviewing Kroger’s first quarter financial performance and then I’ll provide an update on Kroger’s outlook for 2006. Rodney will share additional details about our first quarter results and then we’ll be happy to take your questions. Kroger’s associates continue to focus on delivering improved service, selection and value to our customers. This is translated into another quarter of impressive sales growth. Total sales for the first quarter increased 8.2% to $19.4 billion. This growth continues to be broad based across all divisions and all store departments. Growth was particularly strong in grocery, produce, natural food and fuel. Our convenience stores also had a very strong quarter not only in fuel, but in non-fuel merchandise as well.  Identical supermarket sales increased 7.2% with fuel, and 5.6% without fuel. Once again, by either measure, this represents Kroger’s highest identical supermarket sales since the merger with Fred Meyer in 1999. It is also the 11th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel. We are extremely pleased by this performance and believe it compares very favorably to our traditional supermarket competition and indeed, just about every other retail competitor. Net earnings were $306.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first quarter. Net earnings in the year ago period were $294.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. Rodney will discuss two items that, together, affected our first quarter earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the current year. After adjusting for these items, because they did not have a comparable impact on the prior year, you’ll see that Kroger had a very strong quarter.  It was also another quarter that demonstrated the balance that Kroger’s strategic plan requires among several elements, including: sales, earnings, cost control and capital investment. We continue to believe this strategy is the appropriate path to build sustainable earnings growth and long term value for our shareholders.  Turning now to some comments on 2006 guidance. You may recall that we originally forecasted identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, in excess of 3.5% for fiscal 2006. Today we are raising our sales guidance. Kroger now expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel sales, to exceed 4% for the balance of the year; or approximately 4.5% for the full year. This updated sales guidance reflects the momentum of our first quarter performance as well as opportunities we have identified for additional growth. It is tempered by the difficulty in forecasting additional sales growth in markets that experience unexpected increases as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita during the second half of 2005. Even so, the entire Kroger organization is still very focused on driving improvement in identical sales growth. As we’ve stated many times, sustainable, identical sales growth is a key driver of Kroger’s financial objective to increase earnings and generate value for our shareholders. Kroger’s original guidance for earnings per share growth in 2006 of 6% to 8% did not contemplate the need to increase legal reserves. Based on first quarter results, the Company’s guidance for earnings per share growth for 2006 remains at 6% to 8%, including the increases in legal reserves. Absent the need to increase these reserves, Kroger’s projected earnings per share growth rate would be 9% to 11% for fiscal 2006.  Now I’ll ask Rodney to share some additional details concerning Kroger’s first quarter results. 
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Kroger reported first quarter net earnings of $306.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. These results include a couple of items that are not comparable to our results in the prior year. As we indicated in our guidance for 2006, we began to recognize stock option expense in the first quarter in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This action reduced earnings by $0.02 per diluted share.  As a reminder, our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2006 included stock option expense of $0.05 to $0.06 per diluted share. We now expect the full year effect for fiscal 2006 will be $0.06 per diluted share from recognizing the stock option expense. Also, based on developments during the quarter, Kroger increased its reserves associated with legal proceedings arising from hiring practices at its Ralph’s subsidiary during the 2003 and 2004 labor disputes. The current quarter charge reduced earnings by $0.03 per diluted share and increased the amount established for this contingency. Our reserve represents our best estimate of the Company’s exposure in connection with these legal proceedings. As this is a pending legal matter, we will not comment further on this subject. When it’s appropriate to comment, we will.  As Dave mentioned earlier, after adjusting for the two items I just discussed, we believe Kroger had a very strong quarter. Our financial performance in the first quarter reflects the consistent approach we have taken to managing our business and consistent with the plan we have shared with you.  We continue to balance investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. Our strategy directly affects Kroger’s gross margin, OG&A rate and operating margin. I’ll discuss all three in the context of our first quarter results. Let’s begin with gross margin. FIFO gross margin was 24.55% of sales, a decrease of 61 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2005. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margins declined 9 basis points from the prior year. Kroger’s first quarter selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined 33 basis points.  As a reminder, selling gross margin is a term we use internally at Kroger to describe the Company’s gross margin before incurring expenses directly related to distributing and merchandising the products on our store shelves. These expenses include advertising, warehousing, transportation and shrink. Selling gross margin is a measure of how competitively we are pricing the products we sell. Delivering value to our customers is one component of our overall strategy to improve the shopping experience. In the first quarter we were able to use improvements in shrink, advertising and warehousing expenses to help fund these additional investments and lower prices for our customers.  OG&A declined 19 basis points to 18.17% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, the increase in legal reserves and the stock option expense, OG&A declined 16 basis points. Leverage from strong identical sales plus good cost control in such areas of energy usage and labor productivity helped us overcome some of the significant increases in fuel and energy related costs that many companies are facing.  Excluding our retail fuel operations, we estimate that higher energy prices negatively affected gross margin by 30 basis points and OG&A by 4 basis points for a total negative effect of 7 basis points. This compares favorably to the 13 basis point negative effect in the fourth quarter of 2005. Next, I would like to make a few comments about our operating margin for the first quarter. Kroger’s operating margin on a GAAP basis declined 12 basis points to 3.32% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel sales, an increase in legal reserves and stock option expense, operating margin grew 32% basis points. 24 basis points came from better sales leverage over rent and depreciation expense. The gross margin and OG&A effects I just discussed explain the remainder of the improvement.  In keeping with our strategic plan, Kroger will continue to invest savings generated from reduced cost and improved productivity to enhance our customer shopping experience through better service, product selection and value. On a quarter-by-quarter basis, however, our operating margin may fluctuate depending on the timing of both our savings and our reinvestment in our customer shopping experience.  For fiscal 2006 we still forecast slightly improving operating margins, resulting primarily from improvements at Ralph’s. During the first quarter we saw improvements in sales and profitability at Ralph’s and expect continual improvement. This will be one of the drivers of our earnings per share growth in 2006.  Kroger’s financial triple play strategy supports the successful execution of our customer first business strategy. During the first quarter, strong cash flow enabled Kroger to invest in our high quality asset base, reduce debt and return value to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.  Capital investments totaled $449.9 million in the first quarter compared to $400.6 million a year ago. We are on track to invest approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in capital projects during fiscal year 2006 and we still anticipate total supermarket square footage growth of 1.5% to 2% before acquisitions and operational closings.  For the first quarter, total supermarket square footage grew 1.6%, year-over-year, excluding acquisitions and operational closings. Our return on asset measures improved almost 1% on a pre-tax basis. This indication gives us confidence that we are investing our capital prudently.  During the quarter, Kroger opened, expanded, relocated or acquired 16 supermarkets. We completed 39 remodels and closed 36 locations. Of these locations, 31 were operational closings. 16 of these stores were located in northern California, whereas we previously announced we are exiting the San Francisco and Sacramento markets under the Cala Foods Bell Markets and Ralph’s banner.  Net total debt was $6.6 billion, a reduction of $829.3 million from a year ago, and a reduction of $2.1 billion since January 2000. Net total debt includes a reduction of $526 million to reflect temporary cash investments. Total debt was $7.2 billion, a reduction of $318 million from a year ago. As you know, our investment grade rating is very important to us. We have steadily improved our coverage ratios in recent years, and our net total debt/EBITDA ratio in the first quarter was 1.98, the lowest since our recapitalization in 1988. Fitch Ratings recently reaffirmed our credit rating at BBB, and upgraded our outlook to stable from negative.  During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $19.90, for a total investment of $133.5 million. Last month, we announced our Board's authorization of a new $500 million stock repurchase program, reflecting the Board's confidence in the company's strategic plan and our belief that Kroger shares represent an attractive investment. At the end of the first quarter, there are approximately $486.9 million remaining under that new authorization. Since January 2000, Kroger has invested $3.1 billion to repurchase 162.4 million shares, or 18% of the outstanding shares, at an average price of $19.17. Kroger expects to buy back stock in 2006, in accordance with the company's financial strategy of using one-third of free cash flow for debt reduction, and two-thirds for share repurchase and cash dividend payments. In March, Kroger announced that its Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy, and declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.065 per share. Subsequently, on June 1st, Kroger paid a cash dividend to shareholders, the first such payment since our leveraged recapitalization some 18 years ago. In addition to the financial triple play, Kroger's first quarter cash flow permitted us to make a cash contribution of $150 million to company-sponsored pension plans. This contribution completes our expected funding for fiscal 2006. Kroger's cash contribution in the year ago quarter was $88.6 million for the first quarter, and $300 million for the entire year.  Our first quarter tax rate was 37.4%, compared to 35.9% for the prior year. The current quarter rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes. The first quarter of 2006 rate is higher than the prior year rate because, in 2005, we reduced previously recorded tax contingency allowances, resulting from a revision in the required allowances. We expect that our tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be 37.5%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. Now for some brief comments on labor. While we do not face the same magnitude of contract negotiations this year compared to last year, labor negotiations continue to be a challenge in the face of competitive pressures and rising pension and health-care cost. In each contract negotiation, we will work toward an agreement that meets our objectives for cost reductions or containment, while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits. This balance will allow Kroger to invest in our business to create new job opportunities for our existing associates and hire more people. Now I will turn it back to Dave for some closing remarks.
David Dillon: We are very pleased with Kroger's first quarter results. This quarter gives us a solid start in fiscal 2006 towards achieving or exceeding the objectives we outlined for investors at the beginning of the year. In fact, we have already raised our identical sales and, from an operating standpoint, earnings-per-share guidance for the year to reflect our confidence in Kroger's strategic plan. We believe that Kroger's strong identical sales are primarily a result of our entire organization's effort to connect better with each and every customer, and to improve their overall shopping experience.  We are going about that in several different ways, and it's more than just lower prices. Yes, customers tell us they want value, but they also tell us that there are other aspects of their shopping experience that are very important, most notably customer service and product selection. We are making strides in several areas that our customers notice every day, including shorter wait times at check-out lanes, full shelves with items our customers want, and improvements in the cleanliness of our stores. In each of these areas, we have seen double-digit percent improvements in our tracking measurements.  We are pleased with the progress we are making, but there is still a lot of work to do. Our results this quarter and in the future can be tied directly to the contributions of our 290,000 associates. We appreciate their hard work and thank them for making strides in several key areas. This is a very competitive industry, and customers have a lot of choices, so we recognize that it is our associates who can and will make all the difference. We'll now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers. Please proceed. 
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Congratulations on a great quarter.  One of the things I wanted to ask you is that, when we look at the difference between IDs (identical) and total sales, we see very strong growth, and some of that is clearly the convenience stores which are benefiting from fuel, some is jewelry stores where square footage of course isn't that great, so we're just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that very strong sales performance?
David Dillon: Well, one part of it is, in addition to our very strong sales – that's what's driving that performance – but, part of it is the fuel, of course, because fuel has been a very strong contributor.
Rodney McMullen: It really is all the things you outlined. Obviously, we've had strong sales across the whole company, but, in terms of identical and total supermarket size, as you mentioned, the convenience store group had a very strong quarter, for fuel and also for inside their business, and jewelry had a solid quarter. So, it really was a performance among all parts of our business.
David Dillon: Yea, I'm not sure there was anything, Meredith, that drove the totals any more than what was driving the identicals.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: Would you say that, it looks like from looking at the numbers that, in a rising environment for fuel prices, that there continues to be some pressure on the gross margin? Any sense about when that starts to level off?
Rodney McMullen: If you look at fuel costs themselves, our assumption is that they'll continue to be high for the balance of the year. We do not feel qualified to really know the answer to that though, but we are running our business with the assumption that it continues to be difficult, and we're working awfully hard to figure out a way to manage and reduce the number of miles that we have to travel to get product to our stores, and to do it in a more effective way. So, you know, the assumption is we assume the worst, and we're managing the business for that, and if it's not, then that's wonderful, but we don't see it in any short period of time changing.
David Dillon: I would even add, Meredith, that I think our team here has done a nice job of keeping those costs and the impact on our results to be as low as possible, because the costs are quite high, as you know.
Rodney McMullen: You know, as I mentioned, it was not as bad in the first quarter as the fourth quarter. Now, obviously, some of that improvement was because of the identical sales growth we have had, but some of it was the things that Dave talked about.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: And then, I guess my final question would be, we're beginning to see Cerberus be more aggressive about closing stores. I'm just wondering if you can comment at all about, you know, kind of what you are seeing in the competitive environment, any acceleration in closures outside of Cerberus, and what do you think that that means for your business?
David Dillon: Well, I'll comment on the Albertsons stores that are closing. I'll ask Don, if you have a minute, to comment on the competitive climate. But if you think about the stores that have been announced for closures, we've looked at those individual stores, at least in the markets we're familiar with. Most of those are already very low volume stores, and so, I wouldn't read too much into that. It is pretty obvious to us that, if this is the case, then that should be the way they would do that. As to the other stores that might be available, we always look at stores that are available in the market, whether it's in this particular case, or any case, and we think it's an excellent obligation on our part to think about, how can we make the best of that particular market? And so, whether or not any of these will end up ultimately fitting us or not remains to be determined on an individual store basis. But Don, you want to comment on the overall climate?
Don McGeorge: The overall climate, particularly throughout the quarter, I wouldn't characterize it as being any more or less aggressive than we've been seeing historically. I think that pattern has stayed the same throughout the quarter.
Meredith Adler – Lehman Brothers: I just have one final question: There's been some talk that Wal-Mart is going to consider [inaudible] of new stores in markets where it already has a pretty good penetration. Have you observed that at all, and, you know, do you think that's going to happen, do you think that's a good thing?
David Dillon: Well, to your first question, the answer is no, we have not seen that, I believe, and with me, around here, I'm sure there's no one else that disagrees with that, and, to your second question, I don't think we'll speculate. That's their call obviously, and I don't have an opinion on whether it would happen or not.
Operator: Then our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky - Key McDonald. 
Chuck Cerankosky – Key McDonald: Nice quarter. As I am now looking around at some of your stores, I do see specific store differences in an individual market. Dave, could you talk about how you manage that, you know, if you are looking at a Memphis versus a Cincinnati versus a Portland, Oregon, who's making those local decisions to have the various locations meet the neighborhood needs?
David Dillon: Actually, it's a combination of the work we do here at General Office, and what work goes on at the local divisions. Local divisions, obviously, have the best connection with the local customers. They know the markets, they know the geography, they know their specific stores, and here at General Office, though, we are able to look at data that's particularly helpful. In addition to the typical demographic data that you might expect we look at, our dunnhumby data has been very helpful in thinking about individual store characteristics.  And so, it's really, I think, a combined team effort between the Marketing and Merchandising Group here at General Office and the individual divisions as that was played out. As you know, in years past, our stores were very different from one market to another, but, increasingly, what you'll see is the differences will be more driven by the differences in our customers, more so than just the differences in geography. And so, that segmentation, that process of segmenting stores, thinking about what ought to be offered different in stores, is a very important part of our strategy. I think it is only beginning to be played out, and I think that increasingly you'll see that to be an important factor for us going forward.
Rodney McMullen: There's another thing on Dave's last point there. We do extensively use customer research that's very locally based, including down to the store level, to try to understand what the customers want in those trade areas, each individual trade area, and we try to use that to reflect that in the store to really connect. As Dave mentioned, dunnhumby is part of the backbone of trying to put that process in place, and improving the functionality of that process.
Chuck Cerankosky – Key McDonald: If this is a nine-inning ball game, where are you at in the process?
David Dillon: Well, each one of those, yea, we're expecting an extra-inning game, but we're early in that process still. Dunnhumby, we've been in now several years, we clearly see some strides in key areas. The market research that Rodney described, while we've done market research as a company for lots and lots of years, we actually are focusing it in some different ways today than we did in the past, so I'd say that's in its fairly early stages. So I don't really see us as very deep into the game in this whole process. I see it as clearly progressing though.
Rodney McMullen: To me that question is always a great question. We obviously get asked it a lot. Now, we've always felt like we've always been in the third inning, we've felt that for the last four or five years.
David Dillon: It's a long inning.
Chuck Cerankosky – Key McDonald: As long as you are improving during the inning.
David Dillon: We think we are, yes.
Chuck Cerankosky – Key McDonald: Good. I want to ask a couple of product mix questions. If you're just looking at the food store part of your business, what do you see in product mix in terms of moving towards fresh, and then, if we could shift, when you're looking at some of your general merchandise sales, whether in a Fred Meyer or some of the GM stuff in your marketplace stores or your combos, how are customers behaving towards the higher-ticket merchandise right now?
David Dillon: Well I don't think we have anything specific we would report on consumer behavior today on those kinds of items. I will tell you, though, that -- as we pointed out -- the sales growth we achieved was solidly across all store departments and across all geographies.  The store departments, we called out a few of them to point out the ones that did even better than average. But nonetheless, all of the departments really were contributing. So I don't see it as a major shift either on the part of consumers, based on what is happening in their lives, or on the part of consumers, based on what is happening at Kroger. I really think what is happening is we are getting our best customers to shop more often with us for their full load; and we're getting more people to be our best customer. The combination of those two things is causing, for instance, grocery; a solid quarter in grocery in like that has to be that people are buying more from us than they previously were buying. Nonetheless, we also think our meat and produce, our perishable areas are doing quite well, too and are connecting well with our customers.
Rodney McMullen:  As Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, produce and nutrition both had strong quarters. That is driven by strong base performance; but obviously with organic and natural foods and everything else, it's working very well.
Chuck Cerankosky - KeyBank McDonald:  Last question, can you comment on credit card costs and any ability to manage those, given the environment you are in?
David Dillon:  Well, we would welcome any ideas you might have. The biggest cost increases for us in OG&A that we had to offset; credit card fees were a big one. Utilities we have already talked a little bit about, and of course, pension. Those areas were big issues. Even with the increase in sales we had, credit card fees are still a major issue for us; because those go up as more credit card usage occurs. They don't decline as a result of higher sales; they just keep going higher. It is a big issue.
Rodney McMullen:  But that is one of the reasons why we got involved with the Royal Bank of Scotland on Kroger Personal Finance. In may not necessarily manage the cost, but it does allow us to give the customer the benefit of some of those cost increases directly rather than indirectly.
David Dillon:  Most of us in this room, Chuck, have a Kroger card, which is part of that venture with Royal Bank of Scotland. Many of our customers now, too, in growing numbers have that. Those customers get significant rebates back from us, both on their purchases outside of Kroger and especially for the purchases in Kroger.
Chuck Cerankosky - KeyBank McDonald: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Husson - HSBC.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  I think it would be an interesting bet to see which one of you, Kroger or Wal-Mart, has got the better comparable store sales in grocery right now. I guess my bet might be, with your momentum, it might actually be you. That is probably the first time ever, so congratulations. My question is on the price side of the business. Can you talk a bit about whether the sales on opening price point have been stronger for you recently? Secondly, you track price inventory closely. I think that is probably one of the areas where you haven’t done so well. What have been the sort of improvements you have been seeing in your price, in its tracking? Is it fair to say that because your selling gross margin has gone down, that you are still reducing the pricing gap or the pricing spread between yourself and discounters?
David Dillon: Let's see if I can get all of those; it is quite a few. Let me start with the entry price point items. We are clearly seeing improvement in those sales. Part of that could be driven by what the customer is going through with higher gas prices and needing to reduce their own costs. But I also believe that part of it is the result of a better offering on our part; not only better price points, but also a better assortment of products at the entry-level prices. Clearly, that is an area that we're seeing improvement in the sales. Your second point had to do with how our price image is. Rodney, you have tracked that very closely. Did you want to comment on that?
Rodney McMullen:  We are seeing improvements. Obviously we won't give the specific results, but we're seeing improvements.
David Dillon:  Mark, what was the third?
Mark Husson - HSBC: The actual pricing spreads, are they still coming down? 
David Dillon: As you can tell from what Rodney described, we invested in our selling gross margin 33 basis points in the quarter. That is in a variety of ways. That was targeted in lots of different ways. Some of that would be in everyday pricing, some of that would be in specific everyday pricing. Now that was, in part, offset -- in fact, a lot of it was offset -- by the improvements in shrink and advertising and warehousing, which we also described. So we have invested it more in price in the quarter; and going forward, we expect to continue to do some investing like that, to the extent that we can offset it either by reduced expenses that are embedded in gross -- like the warehouse, advertising, and shrink --or transportation, which has been challenging in recent times. Or, to the extent we can reduce our OG&A cost through better productivity and so forth. Those all will help us focus more on pricing and focus on those non-price initiatives that we have talked a lot about, which are increasingly playing an active role in Kroger and I think producing just as good a results as what the pricing may be producing. In terms of the actual spreads, we have not really given and don't plan to give specific spread numbers. There are so many ways you can calculate that; I don't really believe it would be meaningful for us to try to address that point, except to say that we pay close attention to our pricing position relative to our competitors and believe that we need to keep focus on that continually. There is not a point in time ever where we say, well, we are done with that; we don't need to pay attention to it any longer.
Mark Husson - HSBC:  Finally, can you just talk about the differences in basket and traffic in the composition of your IDs?
David Dillon:  Both have increased in our IDs. Our IDs on average sale, it was up clearly; and transaction count was up clearly on IDs as well as total. So both were contributing.
Rodney McMullen:  It was a little more skewed to the number of transactions versus the size. If you just said over 50% was [on account] and less than 50% would be size.
David Dillon:  It's that data that causes me to say that really what I think is happening is our very best customers are buying more from us, more of what they need. You can see it in lots of different ways, and this is just one of them. We're getting more customers who are considering us their very best customers. The combination of those two has worked really well for us.
Mark Husson - HSBC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Summers - Bear Stearns.
Bob Summers - Bear Stearns:  Actually I want to dovetail off that last question, if you could talk about maybe where the market share is coming from today versus 12-18 months ago? If you had to pick one or two top catalysts for the accelerating ID performance, what would they be?  It feels like there is sort of a sea change in the business right now. Is it independents, or does it have to do with some of the larger transformational events that are occurring? Or is that an additional opportunity?
David Dillon: That is a great question. I don't know that we can identify right now where that is coming from. Once a year, we go through a pretty detailed drill to identify our own market share through our own internal calculations. We try to also then estimate what has happened with other peoples' market share, and we are in a better position to judge that at that point in time. But it is very clear with our sales improvement that we have picked up market share. I don't think there is any way that it could be true for us to have these sales and not have market share improvement. I suspect, based on what I have seen anyway, that it is coming from everything; it is coming from lots of things. We are much more focused on our own customers and what their behavior is in shopping more with us, and winning more customers to shop with us, than we are focused on addressing any one particular competitor, as we look at it. Now if you think about the reason for our sales growth, which is the heart of your question, we think there are a lot of things contributing to it. That is actually what helps us be bullish going forward, looking at the rest of this year. Our sales, for instance. The strong growth in identicals we think is a direct result of the good job our associates are doing in serving customers. We think that is improving every day. We think that our pricing certainly plays a role with that. We also think the non-price initiatives that we have talked often about are playing a very important role. Products, not only what we carry but the fact that we are in-stock on our shelves more often than we maybe were in the past helps a lot. Our people in our stores; we talked about our associates already. The shopping experience, not only the waits in line but also cleanliness of the store, et cetera. Those are all very helpful reasons for our sales improvement. As we mentioned it is broad-based, it's across all divisions and across all departments. So overall, the store conditions that we have achieved, the improvements in those store conditions, I think it paid off in better sales. So ultimately, what we're seeing is I can probably give you ten good reasons that our sales are up, and any one of those is a contributing factor, but none of them fully explains it. That is good news. We take that as good news, because we think that is more sustainable than if I could just point to a few hot promotions that we had run that gave us the high sales.
Bob Summers - Bear Stearns:  Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  A couple of things. At what point does the success with the comps start to flow into your new store model? At what point does it start to model better because the sales are better than they might have been prior to what you have done here? As we look out over the next couple of years, does that lead or will that lead to a likely increase in CapEx, new store openings, pace of remodels? How does that all play out?
David Dillon: Let me comment on the new stores and sales there; and maybe Rodney or Mike will want to comment on the CapEx. I am not sure I understand exactly your connection. In my mind, when I think about our improving comps, what it says is we're running better stores. When we're running better stores, that also suggests that our new stores are likely to be more successful. But we have already made, as we have pointed out, some improvements in the results from our CapEx spending in our new stores and we are pleased with those currently. The overall picture we are trying to describe, the improvements we're trying to make, the success we're having with sales, we think of that as affecting all stores, new and old alike.  I don't really think, though, that because you had momentum in your other sales that your new stores necessarily will be more successful. It all comes down to the experience the customer has when they come in the store. I think that is why we're having the success in our current stores. I also think that is why we're having good success with our new and remodeled stores. 
Rodney McMullen:  The only other thing I would add is I would expect you to see gradually over time a change, not a huge amount at one point. You have heard us talk numerous times, it's one of the reasons we are working so hard on the Marketplace stores and the price format stores, is really trying to create the growth vehicle when you look out three to five years. When you say two to three, I don't think it is going to be something where you just can draw a line. I think it's going to be something you will gradually see the difference. If you look at the Marketplace stores, we obviously did it in Phoenix first, then Columbus. As you know we have some under construction in Cincinnati that will open this year, and we're working on a few other markets.  So I think it's going to be one of those things that you will gradually see a difference. It really is, as we get comfortable understanding what the customers' wants and needs are, and delivering against that.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  So do you think the incremental CapEx where we are today will be new format as opposed to conventional supermarkets?
Rodney McMullen: In any type of meaningful way, it would be.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs: Secondly, has the thought on the breakeven comp changed? Meaning the comp you need to generate, to get some expense leverage, is that number pretty much where it was a year or two ago? Has that gone down? How has that developed?
David Dillon:  I don't know that we think in terms of here is where you have to have sales to have that leverage, and how it changes over time. Instead, I tend to look at where are we now, what do we think we will get in the way leverage now, what is the current environment? In the current environment, obviously in the sales we had last quarter we got very good leverage on our expenses in that quarter. We also think going forward, with the additional guidance we have given or the change in guidance we gave for sales for the remainder of this year, at 4% for the remainder of the year in IDs, we see that as a very good performance.  We see that performance also achieving good leverage on our sales and the impact on the expenses as a result. So you can bracket it in that range if you want, but certainly, we feel like we're getting at that point today.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  All right, two final things. What was the inflation rate for the quarter that you saw?
David Dillon:  Mike, you want to comment on the inflation rate? I don't have the number in front of me.
Mike Schlotman:  If you look at inflation without fuel, it was 1.4%. If you look at without fuel and pharmacy, it was about 1%. So it's fairly benign.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Some things would have been deflationary? Dairy, meat, or no?
Mike Schlotman:  Not a lot. Meat slightly. Grocery was less than 1% inflation which is where dairy would be.
David Dillon:  So if you look at dairy by itself it would be, but we are not seeing much change in the inflation environment.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Do you think we will?
David Dillon:  We are not seeing much change right now based on this data, in terms of what we have seen in the first quarter. We just don't see much change right now.
Mike Schlotman:  You have heard us talk about it before, that one of the best protections against inflation as the CPG companies raise prices more than what real costs are going up, we have our incredibly strong private label program, and we will not raise those prices. So the customer will get that benefit and the private label will pick up share. It happens time and time again whenever a national brand tries to do that.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  All right, and one final thing. As Tesco comes into the U.S., is there a conflict there between you and they with regard to dunnhumby and their ability to use it in the U.S.? Or is that a potential issue, or is it too early to know?
David Dillon:  I think it is too early to know. At this point, the way dunnhumby is structured, though, they're used to compartmentalizing data within their organization. Dunnhumby today serves as a partner with us, and dunnhumby USA serves us. They also serve Tesco in the UK and other places. They serve other retail companies in other locations. At this point, we're not anticipating that being a problem.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  It is not an exclusive for you in the U.S.?
David Dillon: As to some retailers, there is, but not as to Tesco, since they have been a long-term customer and an owner of dunnhumby.
John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs:  Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Very good quarter. Bigger picture question for you on your store base. How do you think about it in terms of current position and where it should be or I guess even could be? Meaning to what extent can you use the dunnhumby data, Food 4 Less, Marketplace, Fresh Fare concept, to better tailor each market? When you think about growth of new concepts, how much of that could be conversions as well?
David Dillon:  Well, we think about new formats and the format array that we currently have all the time. We are presently using dunnhumby data and demographic data and our own market research to help us determine what we can do and where we can do it. You have seen us recently put Marketplace stores in additional markets, which is the beginning of running some differences in formats in existing markets. The biggest change you have actually seen up until now, and you would not necessarily see it unless you shopped in the store pretty regularly, is differences in one store to another. These are just regular combo stores that are segmented more because of what we see in those markets. I think increasingly we are asking ourselves, to what extent can we use these formats like we do segmented stores? How can we use the format as the extreme version of a segmented market? We see some examples of that in some markets where we already have multiple formats. There are also some problematic issues, too, of how you overlap in existing markets, and we still have yet to work through all of that. Rodney, I don't know if you want to comment on that, too.
Rodney McMullen:  To me, the question is a great one. It's one of the things that we're continually working on. What we really find is almost every month we're making progress on that. You actually have to make sure that you don't cause that to slow down a process, because you're learning so much; you do have to get things done. But you will find if you go in one of our stores that we open today and you go in one six months ago, you will see changes in that because of what we have learned in that process.
David Dillon:  I think one of the things I would add, too, that often we get asked, when are we going to take the Fred Meyer store as a store and put it somewhere else? My answer to that has always been the same. That is, that we're doing that every day. We take things we learn from the Fred Meyer stores. Our team general merchandise team here puts together ways in which we can use some of those ideas and thoughts and expressions, and put them into a typical combo store or a Marketplace store or any other store that we operate.  Those are the ways, the many ways that these formats actually contribute even more broadly to the success of the Company.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse: Okay, then one last question for you. Safeway recently increased its fuel promotion. Have you made any changes to that program recently, or even since last year?
David Dillon:  Our fuel promotion, I don't remember if it's gone on for a full year. Basically the fuel promotions we have been consistent over time -- certainly the last six months. Has it been for the last year? I'm looking around in here to see. Yes, in some markets we have had it going on for that long. But it is basically the same. I don't think we're making any big changes there.
Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse:  Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Whitmer – FTN Midwest Research.
Scott Bender - FTN Midwest Research:  Hi, this is actually Scott Bender; Jay is out on the road today. Just a couple questions real quick on the consumer. Within our restaurant coverage we have seen some regional weakness, specifically out on the West Coast in recent months, and some in the Midwest as well. In terms of your sales strength, have you seen any variance by the specific regions that you are concentrated in?
David Dillon:  We don't give out regional sales data. Part of what I think embedded in your question is, is the price of gas impacting consumer behavior in some fashion? At this point, we don't really have any hard data to point to. We are certain, though, there is less expendable income. There has to be, because much more is being spent on gasoline, assuming you take gas out of the expendable income equation. We think it is a net-net slight positive for us, in part because of our convenient locations. But also it may be -- and this is speculation on my part -- but it also may be in part because our customers realize that they can prepare food at home less expensively than they can pay for it in a restaurant.  One of the best ways you can save money, separate from maybe buying Kroger brand in our store, is to shop at our store for the ingredients and make the food at home, rather than shop at a restaurant. But it would be speculation on our part to say that we can identify that trend. Based on the data that you have suggested, some weakness in some of those sectors in restaurants, that certainly could be one of the reasons that might occur. Now one of the reasons we commented that our sales were broad-based, though, is not just because we don't give geography; but that aside, we're trying to illustrate the point that our sales are across the Company doing well. That means -- to me anyway -- that it is not any one competitor or not any one consumer event that is driving them. It is numerous events.
Scott Bender - FTN Midwest Research: All right. Yes, that was going to actually be the second part of my question, whether you were seeing any positive impact from consumers possibly trading out of eating out and eating at home more often in order to save money. So it sounds like you would speculate that that is occurring but there's no hard data to point to, basically?
David Dillon:  We think there is a net-net slight positive with the gas impact from the customers' point of view, but we cannot tell for certain why that is. We just think that it is. I am speculating when I gave you those comments.
Rodney McMullen:  As you know, one of our competitive strategies is to have convenient locations. Our average customer has to drive less than two miles to get to one of our stores. Hopefully that convenience along with things that Dave talked about on saving money, in terms of buying the food in our stores to prepare it, are working in our favor.
David Dillon:  We said years ago, this goes back, 10 years ago -- maybe even longer -- but the combination store that is still today our bread and potatoes -- it's a big part of our business -- that combination store is the best combination size for being a local store that is close to home and having a full assortment of the products customers want to buy. As you get bigger you have to draw from further trade areas. As you get smaller you can't have the kind of mix that you really need to appeal to the wide customer assortment. So it plays exactly to our sweet spot.
Scott Bender - FTN Midwest Research:  All right. Just one other maintenance question real quick. On the OG&A, I know that you said it declined 19 basis points all in; and if you exclude fuel, the legal reserves, and stock options it declined 16 basis points. Just wondering within that 3 basis point difference, how much of that was specifically fuel? Is it 1 basis point, 2 basis points?
David Dillon:  It would be quite a bit. 
Rodney McMullen:  Yes, it would be quite a bit. We did not break it out separately.
David Dillon:  It would be more than the difference, I just don't know what it is. Do you happen to know, Mike? I don't think we have calculated it that way.
Scott Bender - FTN Midwest Research:  Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: Thanks, guys. Quite a quarter on sales. In our surveying we have seen that the price difference between you and the mass merchants can vary quite a bit. I was wondering is there -- and I know you haven't really talked about it -- is there a rolling strategy, where you look at a market and say, okay, now we are going to really drop it? We have seen 5%, 6% price difference in some of your big markets ranging up to 12% to 15% in others. I was just wondering why we would be seeing that.
David Dillon:  Scott, I would offer two explanations. First is we look at our pricing, literally look at it in each market. What do we need? What do we think the competitive landscape is? What does the customer seem to respond to? Really, we look at that as a market-by-market choice. Second is your question also illustrates the extreme difficulty in trying to do price surveys and to come up with variances that are meaningful. We carried tens of thousands of different items, and to try to pick the items that would represent what is happening with pricing is hard to do. We have been in this business at Kroger a long time, and we do that same kind of comparison; and yet we have difficulty finding anyone or even any two or three or four kinds of measurements that tell us the whole picture. I just think doing price comparisons when there are so many items involved is a very hard thing to do, and to make a lot of sense of it, particularly the kind of surveys -- I'm not referring to yours in particular -- but particularly the kind of surveys that are typically run, where it is a few dozen items or a few hundred items even. That is an interesting representation and a nice cut, but it doesn't really tell you the whole picture from the customer point of view.
Rodney McMullen:  The other thing, and you have heard us say it numerous times, there is a lot more to it than just price. In some markets, the customer is much more interested in some of the non-price elements. So in those markets we will focus a lot more attention on different level of service, different level of products, product offering. In some cases we may purposely take higher shrink, as an example, because you have to have that for some of the product variety. So those type of decisions really are things that we look at on a market-by-market basis. When you look at it overall, Dave said it; our sales growth was broad-based, so that would obviously have to pick up markets where we had both spreads in place and obviously had generated good earnings growth, too.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities: I agree with you on the price surveying; they are very difficult to do. But the one thing that did occur to me as we were seeing certain markets, that the price gap was narrow enough, given what you said about the travel, that it could be that there is some switching because it is just not worth it for people to make the drive. Do you think you're seeing that type of action from your customers?
David Dillon:  Scott, not only do we think we are seeing that; you just described perfectly our pricing strategy. What we have said all along is that pricing -- we want to neutralize on price. That is, in the customer's mind, price differences when they occur -- and they don't always occur; we are not the high price guy here, by the way. But when the price differences do occur, we want to make sure that they're small enough that the customer says the other things that Kroger offers are more important. Then there's plenty of times where we are the price leader; and where that is true then of course that can help drive our results. We're not trying to be the low guy on price on every item in every category. That is just not our strategy.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities:  Then on final one. We have written about this Houston market in particular; and this has to do with the strength of your dunnhumby data. The one thing that HEB does down there is really local merchandise really well; to the degree where they know there is a British population around their store. Can your dunnhumby data get to that granularity yet? If not, when do you think we can seen the differences? With not just Hispanic, Brazilian; so you can compete more effectively against some of these regional guys?
David Dillon:  Well, the demographic data, which is available really to anybody, first tells you who resides in the area. What dunnhumby data does for us is tells us the actual purchasing behavior of those customers. Dunnhumby data today can tell us the kind of things you are describing. Our ability to act on that actually is a bigger limiter than the dunnhumby data. But there is a difference between what customers do in their behavior and simply the ethnicity of that particular neighborhood. We find a lot of people who maybe come from Somalia who want products they are used to from home; but they also may want very Americanized products. As a result, it may not simply be that the demographics say that the Somalian population is large and so put a lot of Somalian product there. It may well be, based in the data we see, that it's a little different mix of product that will do well in that store. So dunnhumby actually goes the next step past the demographics into the actual spending and consumer behavior on the part of the people in that particular store. We are able to get to that data today.
Scott Mushkin - Banc of America Securities:  Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Two questions. Can you describe maybe at a typical store, on the conversation about segmenting, it is sort of an artificial question: but the SKU count in organics and produce and in dry grocery?
David Dillon: I'm not sure I understand your question. Can we describe the SKU count?
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Can you quantify it? 
David Dillon: Well, you offered a comment about store segmentation, and you kind of cut out a little bit, so I wasn't sure I picked up the full gist of your question. 
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: By store, could you quantify the organic produce by SKU count, and the organic dry grocery by SKU count?
David Dillon:  Let me tell you what we have done in those areas. We have expanded our natural food. We have expanded our natural food and our organic offering in a number of stores. We have segmented those stores based on our own read of the data where it will be more successful than in others. So we won't put, say 100 SKUs of produce organic product in every store; but we will easily put 100 SKUs of produce organic product in selected stores where the demographics or the customer behavior is such that it will work well.
Rodney McMullen:  Or even more.
David Dillon:  Yes, or even more, and it will grow. We let it grow naturally to where the customers want it to grow. We do have a number that would be that high and some that would be higher. Then same thing in grocery. It gets a little cloudy what is in the natural food category and what is in the grocery category because a number of products that you would think of as traditional grocery could be classified as a natural food product. We also have offered them in a wide variety of ways. We been very successful, for instance, at Fred Meyer, where they have a separate department and it's worked extremely well. In other markets, Colorado being an example of that, where we have distributed the product throughout the grocery departments, it works very well there too. To get a SKU count in that area I think would be impossible; trying to determine if you're going to call this an organic item or not.  What is crystal clear though is the SKU counts are growing every day in both grocery, and in produce, and in other categories too. Health and beauty care, it is growing there. I can't think of a category where it is not growing, really.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Just to follow up on the produce. At a medium store, I am sure some of the stores, I don't know if it is close to zero, but in others it's where you said, 100 plus. What might that be on the organic produce SKU count at kind of your medium store?
David Dillon:  Well, I think it varies enough that I am not sure medium would be very helpful. But maybe half of that, I don't know, 50 or so ballpark. I just don't know that that is helpful, because really we're trying to tailor based on what we see in the particular markets and in the particular stores.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Okay, one last thing which is probably more helpful. How quickly is that mix going from a higher index SKU count of organic versus a lower one? How quick is that shift occurring?
David Dillon: Would you repeat that question? I'm not sure I followed it.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: You know, how quickly are your stores becoming more highly indexed in organic over time?
David Dillon: How quickly are we moving in this direction? I would say there's two things that are happening. The customers are moving to more interest in organics than was there before. That is for a variety of reasons. So even a mainstream store, availability of organics is beginning to have some importance. Which is why we would have some presence in a kind of middle-of-the-road store. But in addition to that, we are improving on what we're doing in our own offering. Vendors are providing more available products. We are sourcing it better. We are pushing ourselves on the standards on the organics as well. Working with growers, for instance, in produce to develop a wider variety of product and a better quality of product. I think it is all of those things that are contributing to it rising at a quicker pace. The incremental change in terms of what is happening in these sales would be very strong because of the double-play of customers more interested and we're doing a better job of providing the products.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets: Thanks. My second question is on the gross margin, where this quarter and last quarter you gave granularity into the selling gross margin. What drops out of that is it is clear that you have big improvements in shrink and warehousing and advertising. Could you kind of rank order those three cost areas as to which is improving the most?  Dave, I think you talked about it a bit; but could you kind of just comment on what you think is sustainable in there? 
David Dillon:  The ranking of advertising, shrink, and warehousing improvements, I don't know for sure. 
Rodney McMullen: We really should not get into that level of detail. In terms of sustainability, I think the market will tell us how sustainable it is in terms of how the market customers react.
David Dillon: What we have done, though, in shrink as an example, because that's been an important one for a long time, the steps we are taking we believe are sustainable steps. They are intended as the kind of thing we can do for a very long time. But Rodney is right, the market will determine a lot of that. Shrink changes too, though. Take for instance the organic product question that you were asking earlier. The question of organics and how those sales work. Well, the more organics we offer in our stores, until they really take off in sales like a conventionally grown product, you end up with more shrink. We're not trying to drive shrink at any cost. We are trying to drive shrink in balance with the other things. Balance is the whole theme of really everything we are trying to do in this business plan, and I think this quarter illustrates many parts of that. This particular point illustrates it too.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Just a comment on the market in a sense to help determine that; I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you are trying to say. I am interpreting that to mean there is a lot of sales leverage in those areas; and that is what you're talking about.
David Dillon:  Yes, we think there is. In fact that is some of the balance point. We often are pushing ourselves in categories or products that will improve our sales but might increase our shrink.  In balancing that, what we look at is the sales benefit; and then we look at how much shrink are we talking about; and we look at what is left over when we are done. Sustainability in our sales growth and our earnings is really what we are after here. I think what you described is exactly correct.
Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets:  Thank you.
David Dillon: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. I wanted to focus a little on the Albertson's dislocations. Have you been able to see any store level or divisional data that shows that some of those closures from Cerberus have impacted you? Could just give us an idea of how much of your store base is overlapped with the Cerberus-owned properties. Do you think this could be a big benefit for you in the next couple quarters?
David Dillon:  Well, on the overlap, I will see if Rodney has anything he wants to comment on that in a second. But before we get to that, let me just comment on the sales. There's two things I would offer. First is the stores that have been announced for closure are already low-volume stores. So the impact in those markets will not likely be much to notice, because they are low-volume stores. Secondly is, one of the main reasons we talked about our sales being broad-based in geography and through departments is to illustrate that our sales growth is not just the direct result of what is happening in any particular market. Yes, we have some markets that are better than others.  I would not describe our sales improvement as a functioning result of what is happening in Cerberus or in any part of the former Albertson's chain. Do you want to comment on the overlap, Mike and Rodney? I think they are looking at the numbers to try to see if they can get some sense of that. 
Mike Schlotman: Relative to the Cerberus assets, obviously they're in isolated markets. I probably should not speculate on the number of stores without doing the calculation, but it is a relatively low percentage of our total store base is overlapping with the Cerberus assets.
Rodney McMullen:  It is probably 10% to 15% of our stores.
David Dillon: I think as I look at the transaction we went through, for me the real question isn't so much the short term, what is the impact now? But the long term, what is the message here? The message here is this is what has been happening in the industry for a very long time. Consolidation, change in how we survive with customers today, and how we thrive with customers today. The business plan that we have carved out at Kroger we think is the best combination to end up achieving the ability to thrive in today's business climate and today's business environment.  We're pleased with the results that we have just reported and I think it is specifically because of the strategy that we have carved out.
Rodney McMullen:  Our assumption is that they will run better stores than has been run in the past. If they don't, then that is wonderful, but they have a good management team they have put in place. Our assumption is they will continue to improve the operations of the stores they have that they don't close.
David Dillon:  We respect the operators both of the Cerberus stores but also the SuperValu group. They will do a fine job, so we think that will be a continued competitive challenge in the industry.
Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
David Dillon:  Thank you. Let me just close. Before we sign off today, I would like to make one last comment to our associates who are listening in today. Good results don't just happen. The strong results of the sales and the improved earnings that we just reported are a direct result of your personal efforts. You are raising the bar here at Kroger, and these results illustrate what we can accomplish individually and collectively. Thank you for your commitment to our customers. Let's all keep reminding each other what our paycheck says -- a satisfied customer made this paycheck possible. Thank you for joining us today. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation on today’s conference call. This concludes today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Kroger Fourth Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cindy, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. If at anytime during the call you require assistance, please key “*” followed by “0” and a coordinator will be happy to assist you. I would now like to turn the call over to Carin Fike. Please proceed.
Carin Fike, Manager of Investor Relations: Thank you for joining us. Before we begin I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. Kroger assumes no obligations to update that information. Our fourth quarter press release as well as this morning's press release about Kroger's dividend announcement and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Dillon.
David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Carin, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 financial results. With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman, Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to begin by recapping some highlights of Kroger's fourth quarter sales results and then I will provide market share information along with sales and earnings guidance for 2006. Rodney will discuss Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 results. He will provide additional detail on our 2006 guidance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. The continued focus of Kroger's associates on delivering improved service, product selection and value to our customers has generated another quarter of impressive sales growth. Total sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.5% to $14.7 billion. This growth was broad based across all divisions and store departments. Grocery, produce, bakery and fuel sales were particularly strong. In addition, our holiday sales were well planned and well executed by our associates. The convenience stores turned in another solid quarter of sales growth not only in fuel sales but in non-fuel merchandise too. Fourth quarter identical supermarket sales increased 6.2% with fuel and 4.7% without fuel. This represents Kroger's 10th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel. Fourth quarter comparable supermarket sales which included expansions and relocations increased 6.7% with fuel and 5.1% without fuel. Our fourth quarter identical supermarket sales results reflect Kroger's highest identical supermarket sales since the merger with Fred Meyer in 1999. All 17 of our supermarket divisions had positive identical sales growth. We are extremely pleased by this performance. As we discussed before, sustainable identical sales growth is a key driver of Kroger's financial objective to increased earnings and generate value for our shareholders. Each year at this time we provide you with statistics that describe Kroger's market share. The market share figures that we report are based on internal estimates. We include all retail outlets that sell merchandise comparable to our own including supercenters and other nontraditional retail formats such as dollar stores, drug stores, and warehouse clubs. Although we look at market share statistics provided by a variety of third party resources throughout the year, we believe it is important to take a broader view of the market to understand any shifts in this area and respond to them appropriately. When you're doing your own analysis in this area, please keep in mind that many third party market share data providers do not include these alternative formats. Kroger defines a major market as one in which we operate 9 or more stores. By this definition Kroger serves customers in 44 major markets. Last year that figure was 52. The decrease is primarily due to a realignment of metropolitan statistical areas or MSA's by the U.S. Census Bureau. We rely on the Census Bureau reports to attain the total sales potential for a particular market in order to calculate our market share. Under this MSA realignment certain markets were combined with other markets, and other markets were separated into two or more markets each containing less than 9 of our stores. In our count of 44 major markets, we also excluded the San Francisco and Sacramento MSA's due to the market exits we have announced for 2006 under our Cala Foods, Bell Markets and Ralphs banners. We'll continue to operate price-impact warehouse stores under the Foods Co banner in these markets but neither MSA contains sufficient Foods Co locations to meet our definition of a major market. Now for the market share detail. For 2005 Kroger held a Number #1 or Number #2 share position in 35 of our 44 major markets. Kroger's overall market share in these 44 markets rose more than 35 basis points during 2005 on a volume weighted basis. Our share increased in 29 of those 44 markets, declined in 12, and remained unchanged in three. Kroger competes against 1,129 supercenters, an increase of 109 over last year. There are 32 major markets in which supercenters have achieved at least a Number #3 market share position. Kroger's overall market share in these 32 markets rose more than 50 basis points during 2005 on a volume weighted basis. Our share increased in 24 of those 32 major markets, declined in 7, and remained unchanged in 1. Of the 1,129 supercenters that I mentioned, 875 are operated by Wal-Mart. This is an increase of 94 over last year. Wal-Mart supercenters have achieved at least a Number #3 share position in 28 of the major markets where Kroger faces significant supercenter competition. Kroger's overall market share in these 28 markets rose nearly 40 basis points during 2005 on a volume weighted basis. Our share increased in 20 of these major markets, declined in 7 and remained unchanged in 1. I realize that all those market share data could be overwhelming, so let me recap the most important points. First, Kroger's overall market share in our 44 major markets rose more than 35 basis points during 2005. Second, our share gains in the markets where we face significant Wal-Mart supercenter competition were even stronger. In those markets our overall market share rose nearly 40 basis points. And third, we faired even better if you include all the major markets where we face supercenter competition. This is Kroger's best performance since we began tracking this type of information. A popular theme among some investors in the media these days is that traditional supermarket operators like Kroger are being squeezed out of business by price focused discounters at one end and high-end specialty retailers at the other. To the contrary, the market share statistics that I just shared with you show that Kroger continues to grow in this highly competitive industry environment. We believe these statistics clearly demonstrate that our strategy to connect better with our customers is succeeding. Our retail price investments combined with our service and selling initiatives led to excellent market share gains in 2005. Kroger's significant market share continues to be one of our key competitive strengths and we believe that it is critical to further improve our market share in 2006 and beyond. There is plenty of room for further growth even with Kroger's strong share in our 44 major markets almost 50% of the share in those same markets is held by competitors without our economies of scale. Well, turning now to Kroger's expectations for fiscal 2006. Over the past several years Kroger has been transitioning its business model to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers. This strategic plan requires a balance among several elements including sales, earnings, and capital investment and is driven by strong sustainable identical sales growth. Kroger plans to grow identical sales through merchandising and operating initiatives that improve the shopping experience and build customer loyalty. These initiatives will be funded by operating cost reductions and productivity improvements. As a result of this strategy, Kroger expects to deliver earnings per share growth in 2006 and 2007 of 6 to 8% per year. In addition, shareholder value will be enhanced by the yield associated with the cash dividend we announced earlier today. The estimated range for earnings per share growth in fiscal 2006 includes the effect of beginning to recognize stock option expense which is largely offset by the benefit of a 53rd week in fiscal 2006. Kroger's earnings per share growth will be driven by three factors. First, strong identical sales. We expect to achieve identical supermarket sales growth in excess of 3.5% excluding fuel sales. Second, slightly improving operating margins primarily resulting from continued improvement in Southern California. And three, fewer shares outstanding due to continued share repurchased activity. Now Rodney will review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 results as well as some additional guidance for 2006.
Rodney McMullen, Vice Chairman: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Kroger reported net earnings of $282.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. In the year ago period Kroger reported a net loss of 652.1 million or $0.89 per diluted share. The year ago results include a goodwill impairment charge of $903.8 million pre-tax that affected net earnings by $860.8 million or $1.17 per diluted share. Some of you may have noticed back in December Kroger sold 9 shopping centers anchored by Kroger stores for approximately $80 million. Following the sale we have signed a long-term lease agreement with the buyer to continue our operations in each of the 9 Kroger stores. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles the gain associated with the sale of these shopping center properties will be recognized over the term of the lease agreements. Thus the sale had no effect on our fourth quarter earnings per share. Now turning to gross margin and OG&A. FIFO gross margin was 24.85% of sales, a decrease of 22 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin rose 32 basis points from the prior year. When we analyze gross margin internally, we use a term that we call selling gross margin to describe Kroger's gross margin before incurring expenses directly related to distributing and merchandising the products on our store shelves. These expenses include advertising, warehousing, transportation and shrink. Selling gross margin is a measure on of how competitively we are pricing the products we sell. Kroger's fourth quarter selling gross margin on non-fuel sales declined approximately 23 basis points. In other words, we were able to use improvements in shrink and warehousing expense to fund additional targeted investments in competitive prices for our customers. This remains an important part of Kroger's strategy. OG&A declined 38 basis points to 17.98% of sales. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, OG&A declined 6 basis points. Leverage from strong identical sales plus cost control in areas such as healthcare and workers' compensation helped offset increases in credit card fees, pension and energy related costs, improvements in OG&A expense at Ralphs also contributed to this decline. Excluding our retail fuel operations, we estimate that higher energy prices negatively affected gross margin by 5 basis points and OG&A by 8 basis points for a total negative effect of 13 basis points or approximately $17 million pre-tax. In 2005 strong cash flow enabled Kroger to carry on its financial triple play strategy. And that is to deploy cash to grow the business and maintain our high quality asset base, reduce debt and return value to shareholders through share buybacks. We believe achieving the financial triple play is important for our future success. Capital investment totaled $1.3 billion for the year compared to 1.6 billion in 2004. During 2005 Kroger opened, expanded, relocated or acquired 52 supermarkets. We continued the expansion of our multiple format strategy. Our store portfolio now consist of 2,214 combo stores, a 143 price impact warehouse stores, a 123 multi-department stores, and 27 marketplace stores. The rollout of the marketplace concept has followed our general strategy for format expansion. You might recall that in Phoenix we converted some of our existing stores to the marketplace format back in 1999. When we were comfortable with the economics of the business model for our new store, we built a concept store from the ground up this store is located in Chandler, Arizona. The next step is learning how to operate the concept in other markets which we did first in Salt Like City and then in Columbus, Ohio. Now we're ready to expand the format to another market. In 2006, we plan to open two marketplace stores right here in our hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. We are very excited about these plans and our ability to further segment our diverse customer base with our multi-format strategy to meet our customer needs. Also during 2005 we remodeled 147 stores and closed 66 locations including 54 operational closings. Net total debt at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $6.9 billion. That's $800.7 million less than a year ago. Net interest expense for the full year totaled $510.4 million, a decrease of $46.6 million versus a year ago. We have reduced net total debt by $1.9 billion since January 2000. Our investment grade rating is very important to us. We are focused on improving our coverage ratios. Our net total net to EBITDA ratio in the fourth quarter was 2.06. This is our best performance on this measure since Kroger's leveraged recapitalization in 1988. During the fourth quarter Kroger repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of stock at an average price of $18.93 for a total investment of 49.4 million. At the end of the fourth quarter there was approximately $114.3 million remaining under the $500 million stock buyback announced in September 2004. Since January 2000, Kroger has invested $3 billion to repurchase 155.7 million shares of stock at an average price of $19.13. Kroger continues to buy back stock. Our customers response to Kroger's strategic plan has now made it appropriate to return value to our shareholders both through our current stock repurchase plan and additionally through the payment of a dividend. Earlier today Kroger announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy and declared the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.065 per share. The board's approval of the dividend and the continuation of the share repurchase program underscores its confidence in Kroger's strategic plan. Needless to say, this is a monumental event for the company as Kroger is not paid a cash dividend since our leverage recapitalization in 1988, some eighteen years ago. Kroger's board will review the dividend annually with the objective of increasing the amount of the dividend. Any changes in the dividend amount will be made after consideration of the needs of the business, the interests of shareholders, cash flow trends, and other factors. We continue to be guided by our long-term financial strategy of using one third of free cash flow for debt reduction and two-thirds for share repurchases and the payment of a cash dividend. Before sharing some additional guidance for 2006 I would like to briefly review some of the objectives for 2005 that we outlined for investors a year ago. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our associates, Kroger delivered a strong performance in 2005 that exceeded our original expectations. At the beginning of fiscal 2005, we expected to achieve identical supermarket sales growth in excess of 2% for the full year including southern California and excluding fuel sales. When we reported our second quarter results, we raised that bar to exceed 3% for the balance of the year. Our identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel for fiscal 2005 was 3.5% well in excess of our original goal. We expected fiscal 2005 net earnings to increase compared to 2004 excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge. On a per share basis we originally expected fiscal 2005 net earnings per share to exceed $1.21 as a result of four factors. First, improved results in southern California; second, growth in the balance of the company; third, lower interest expense and finally, fourth, fewer shares outstanding as a result of stock buybacks. When we reported our first quarter results, we raised that target to exceed $1.24 per diluted share. Today we reported fiscal 2005 net earnings of $1.31 per diluted share. Each of the four factors I mentioned contributed to our 2005 earnings per share growth. We believe that this is a very strong performance in a challenging operating environment. In 2005 Kroger invested cost savings and productivity improvements to improve our customer shopping experience through enhanced service, product selection and value. Successful execution of this strategy resulted in a better balance between margin and sales growth. The structure of our incentive plan for 2006 will further encourage this balance to deliver sustainable sales growth, earnings growth, and an improved shopping experience for our customers. We would now like to provide some additional guidance for 2006. Dave already outlined our identical sales and earnings guidance for 2006. I would like to add that this guidance assumes that the same highly competitive environment we see today stays the same. It also assumes that energy prices remain at the level where they are today. Here are some other expectations that are incorporated into our guidance for the year. We plan to invest approximately 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion in capital projects excluding acquisitions. These capital projects include 30 to 40 new stores, 150 to 175 remodels, and other investments to support our customer first business strategy. We anticipate supermarket square footage growth of 1.5% to 2% before acquisitions and operational closings with an emphasis on large fast growing markets. We expect to make a cash contribution of $100 million to $150 million to the company sponsored pension plans. This is a reduction of 150 million to 200 million from 2005. We plan to adopt the expensing of stock options in the first quarter of 2006. Our estimate for this action will reduce fiscal 2006 net earnings by $0.05 to $0.06 per diluted share. We estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 37.5% and cash taxes will be approximately a $160 million higher than last year primarily due to higher net earnings. Recall that we also enjoyed a cumulative reduction of approximately $340 million during fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 in our cash tax payments due to Federal Bonus Depreciation Legislation passed by Congress in 2001. That provision expired in December 2004. And related cash benefit now started the reverse in 2005. Labor negotiations will continue to be a challenge in the face of competitive pressures and rising pension and healthcare costs. We'll be back at the bargaining table in 2006 with a number of contracts covering smaller groups of associates -- but nothing of the magnitude we faced in 2005. While we do not give specific quarterly guidance, I do want to point out the timing of certain items that will affect our quarterly results during 2006. The estimated stock option expense of $0.05 to $0.06 per diluted share will effect each quarter of the fiscal year. Expenses with San Francisco and Sacramento market exits that Dave mentioned earlier will occur in the first half of 2006. This has been reflected in our guidance for the year. The sales and earnings benefits of the 53rd week that Dave mentioned will occur in the fourth quarter as it contains one additional week for the year. We believe that Kroger's 2006 strategic plan is a balanced approach that will allow Kroger to meet the wide ranging needs and expectations of our customers. This in turn will position the company to deliver value to our shareholders in the form of a strong business model that produces solid sustainable growth in both earnings and the dividend that we announced earlier today. Now I’ll turn it back over to Dave for some closing remarks.
David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Rodney. We're very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005. As Rodney discussed, our fiscal 2005 results compared very favorably to each of the objectives we outlined for you at the beginning of 2005. During 2005 we made progress on many fronts. We grew our average market share by more than 35 basis points in a highly competitive environment. We showed even stronger growth in the supercenter markets. We continued to improve our pricing position with an increased focus on non-price initiatives such as improved customer service and product selection tailored to match the broad mix of customers who shop in our stores. Already 2006 is proven to be a year of continued consolidation in our industry. This process began several years ago and will continue for several years ahead. Kroger's financial strength positions us to take advantage of the many opportunities that consolidation provides. In this environment we will continue our focused efforts to connect directly with customers in 2006. We believe that our multi-format approach and our ability to segment our customer base uniquely positions Kroger to serve the very diverse needs of today's grocery shoppers. We're working harder every day to become increasingly relevant to each and every customer who shops our stores and we have the expertise and technology to do so. We'll now be happy to take your questions.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Steve Chick: Hi. Thanks. Good quarter.
A - David Dillon: Thank you, Steve.
Q - Steve Chick: And some exciting news. Just a question maybe for Mike or Rodney. With your capital spending level that you're increasing for next year, your CapEx of D&A ratio this year looks like it hovers around one. And that's usually pretty low. Is it a function of, kind of getting back to a more normalized rate of spending or do you think maybe you are, there is room to bring that down as you head into next year as well?
A - Rodney McMullen: As you know, this is Rodney, we always continue to focus on making sure we use our capital wisely. We do feel that we have some additional opportunities with remodels and our plan to be to get additional remodels done in '06 versus what we did in '05. So part of it will be that. With that said, we will continue to focus on being tighter with capital rather than looser with capital. The other piece, we are starting to see some improvement in our performance to budget on the capital that we have spent over the last couple of years, and as we see that continued improvement, that will also give us more comfort in spending a little bit additional capital. Mike, anything you want to add.
A - Michael Schlotman: The other thing is we're spending a lot of time and energy to make sure we get fiscal 2007 storing program off in the right food and built into our plan to some expectation that we'll be spending some dollars in the second half of '06 on '07 openings so we hit the ground running in '07.
Q - Steve Chick: Okay, I guess it’s been amazing this year that you have been able to achieve the sales you've gotten with a pretty low level of capital spending, and that doesn't sound like me to I guess what I am trying to look at is if you kind of under spent and it was a pretty good year and doesn't sound like you think of it as having to catch up as you head into ’06 at this point?
A - Rodney McMullen: Certainly not. It would certainly be really because, as Mike said for 2007 and certainly several good opportunities we see for '06.
Q - Steve Chick: Okay. And the second question related to cash flow, I guess, with the new dividend and the two-thirds, one third allocation, you're operating cash flow has actually been flat to down for two years. And if you spend a little more in capital spending, it sounds like that remaining piece after the dividend is a lot lower that you can allocate between share repurchases and debt pay down. It’s we, how at risk is it that you might end up buying back a little less stock as you look and, as you go through '06?
A - Michael Schlotman: I think if you look at our cash flow levels, we're comfortable that we're going to be able to maintain and do all three of those. Obviously anytime you decide to have a fixed use of cash like a dividend that is less dollars I have to apply to stock buy back, but when you look at two-thirds of what a reasonable amount of cash flow would be and if you actually looked at operating cash flow minus investing cash flow , it’s quite a strong number this year, and that's actually a lot better number than the prior year, and I think we have plenty of room to continue to do all three of those and as we like to call the financial triple play and execute on all three of those strategies. I mean it’s readily apparent if I pay this kind of dividend, that's less we have to buy in stock but we factored that into our plans going forward.
Q - Steve Chick: Great, now your cash was clearly supportive. As I recall I think you have a 500 million may be maturing in '06 and if I take the numbers as you reported it and in fact earned higher capital spending, it seems like we might be smart to lean more towards debt pay downs we forecasted in the next year but just kind of wanted to get a sense how you thought about that but good quarter in any event, and I appreciate it. Thanks.
A - Rodney McMullen: Steve, I continue using the two-thirds for stock buy back and dividend and one third for debt. If you look at 2005 we ended up reducing our net debt by a little bit over 800 million. If we realized that the cash flow was going to be that good, we would probably been a little bit more aggressive on buying back stock during the year but, if you look at the end of the day, we're very pleased with our free cash flow in 2005.
Q - Steve Chick: Okay, thanks.
A - David Dillon: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Q - Eric Wiseman: Good morning, guys. This is Eric Wiseman from Goldman. First, just wanted to ask you a little bit about the competitive environment with Wal-Mart. On the margin in terms of what you are observing in their stores and execution wise over the past 6 months or year, what do you seeing the most focused on what are they getting better at or may be where might they be falling behind, and then also on the margin, are they now delivering a better perishable offering?
A - David Dillon: Well, Eric, I don't plan to make this call about analyzing Wal-Mart's competitive strategy, but I will maybe just say to you that Wal-Mart is a very strong competitor. We admire what they do, hold them in very high regard, watch closely the steps they take and I see the competitive environment overall including the part that Wal-Mart plays to be a very strongly highly competitive as we've said before, and it continues to be that way, and we expect it to continue to be that way. I think that's a function really of the overall retailing environment we find ourselves in. We all have to find a way to fight for the sales and become relevant to the customer, and so that's what they're doing, that’s what we're doing and you can see the results of ours in our quarter release. Rodney, do you want to add anything.
A - Rodney McMullen: Yes, the other thing as we develop our plan and where we're trying to go, we certainly assume that Wal-Mart will continue to get better on perishables just like Safeway and Albertsons and Whole Foods and Auld and everybody else. So, our assumption is that every competitor will continue to get better and every day when you get in their stores you can see a Wal-Mart perishable department produce is better today than it was 2 or 3 years ago. We would hope that you go into one of our stores and you would say the same about us.
Q - Eric Wiseman: Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, can you guys talk a little bit about your business in California, first in terms of the pace of the ongoing recovery at Ralphs and how much room or where you see the opportunities there. And then secondly, when you think longer term about our position in Northern California, are you guys planning to stay there in a more limited way or due foresee opportunities now that Albertsons is exiting that would allow to you increase your presence there over the long-term?
A - David Dillon: First let me talk about Southern California. We were pleased with the progress really in 2005. But we're not yet satisfied with where we are. On the sales front if you take Ralphs and Food 4 Less together for the Southern California market are identical sales, I believe it was identical was up 3.3%. That would be the highest of that same metric through all four quarters last year, so that's improvement. And we expect to see further improvement in 2006 in their overall financial performance. We're bullish on the market. We're bullish on our associates. I have been out there a number of times and I am very impressed with what they're attempting to do. And as you probably could see in our numbers, OG&A improvement some of the OG&A improvement reported by Kroger was helped by what happened out at Ralphs in Southern California, so we're quite optimistic, but we're quick to recognize that we're not yet satisfied with what where we are, and really shouldn't be. Turning to Northern California, as you know we're exiting for the Ralphs and the Cala and Bell format but our Foods Co, we're pleased with and continue to accelerate let it evolve further. And so, our presence in the short-term foreseeable future at least will be based upon that strategy and the success of that format.
A - Rodney McMullen: I was going to say we have several Foods Co locations that we're working on developing in Northern California, and we feel very positive about that format in the market.
A - David Dillon: It’s really not just maintenance. It’s a growth opportunity.
Q - Eric Wiseman: Okay. Thank you very much.
A - David Dillon: Thanks, Eric.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Q - Meredith Adler: Hey, guys.
A - David Dillon: Hi.
Q - Meredith Adler: I want to start by just I have to admit I am a little confused about the guidance, so I just have some questions understanding the extra week and first you get extra sales, you obviously have extra operating expenses. The rent and D&A go up for the extra week?
A - Rodney McMullen: Mike, do you want to highlight that on the extra week.
A - Michael Schlotman: We pay rent every day we have the store opened. I mean basically every operating expense we have virtually every operating expense we have, we expense on a daily basis on the calendar year, so virtually every expense we have continues whether it’s a 52 week year or 53-week year. Our wage expense, our interest expense, utilities all of that is based on an annual year.
Q - Meredith Adler: So D&A as well would be have a 53rd week?
A - Michael Schlotman: That would not.
Q - Meredith Adler: Okay.
A - Michael Schlotman: One other thing on identical sales, that will be 53 weeks to 53 weeks on the 3.5% guidance rate that we provided.
Q - Meredith Adler: Right.
Q - Meredith Adler: And the guidance of 6% to 8%, is there any impact from the 53-week year in positive in this come in '06 and negative in '07 and your averaging them to 6 to 8, is that an average between the two or does the stock option expense completely wiped out any of the benefits on the extra week?
A - Michael Schlotman: Basically when you look at 2006 the stock option expense eliminates the benefit of the extra 53rd week in 2006. Then expectation for 2007 would be on top of that 2006 results.
Q - Meredith Adler: Right. Okay. That you wouldn’t have a stock option expense incremental in '07?
A - Michael Schlotman: Well, you would have it but not incrementally obviously.
Q - Meredith Adler: Right. And then my other question is just I think it is useful to clarify what you did in Northern California. There is nothing left once these closures are completed other than Foods Co, right so all the Ralphs, all the Calas, all the Bell's would be closed.
A - Michael Schlotman: When you look at Sacramento and San Francisco north, that would be correct.
Q - Meredith Adler: Okay. I guess I have to say I am going to go back to the guidance. We had somehow I think The Street had expected that the numbers would be stronger. You talked about pension contributions being lower. In terms of fuel costs, are you looking for ID's with fuel to be higher with ID's without fuel or you looking for them to be the same?
A - Michael Schlotman: We really don't estimate sales – identical dollars with fuel sales because we really look at that on a gallons basis rather than a dollar basis, because we obviously weren't -- our ability to project what retail fuel prices will be we really don't think that's our business.
A - Michael Schlotman: Your comment on pension, Meredith, the guidance we gave is our cash contribution will be that much less to the Company sponsored pension plan. That has no relationship to what we have to expense for those plans based on the wonderful world of FASB 87. The book expense and the cash expense for those do not equal. So our book expense won't necessarily be down by that amount. That's just the cash we have to fund the plan by.
Q - Meredith Adler: Can you comment at all about what pension expense will be higher?
A - Michael Schlotman: It will be incrementally higher in '06 versus '05 for the Company sponsored plans.
Q - Meredith Adler: Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much.
A - Michael Schlotman: It’s not like it’s a nickel or anything like that, but it is higher. It’s not lower like the cash is. It’s relatively modest increase.
A - David Dillon: Okay. Anything further, Meredith. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Key McDonald.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Good morning everyone, nice quarter.
A - David Dillon: Thank you.
A - Michael Schlotman: Yeah.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: If we could talk a little about how you determine the dividend size, I would be interested in that. Did you pick a specific yield? And what were you looking at in terms of free cash flow trade off's especially with stock re-purchase activity or amounts?
A - David Dillon: Rodney or Mike?
A - Rodney McMullen: Well, on the dividend yield it really was looking at – where was the S&P 500 overall? What type of cash capacity did we think was appropriate and the trade off of using free cash flow for the dividend versus buying back stock, and the board looked at all three of those as going part of that deliberation, and really got comfortable that the $0.065 per quarter would put a yield that similar to the S&P 500 at this point and not create any constraints from a cash standpoint that would cause the company to have to change the business plan of that we're on. So, it’s really all three of those factors together on a day. Mike, do you want to add anything else.
A - Michael Schlotman: No, I agree with you.
A - David Dillon: That's exactly correct.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Okay. And just a clear housekeeping on the restatements announced the other day, is there any cash component to that?
A - Rodney McMullen: No.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Dave, you mentioned you continue to like the strategy of developing multiple store formats. How about when you're looking at a single market and you have more than one format? Can you address what you're doing to customize stores to individual neighborhood demographics?
A - David Dillon: Well we have – there is a variety of ways to look at this. Our format certainly distinguished from one type of customer to another. But I actually look more often within a format and the easiest one to take would be a combo store, traditional combo store. And within a combo store there is a wide variety of ranges of kinds of stores that we'll try to run and are trying to run today. Some are more towards the value end of the equation even though they may not be a Food 4 Less they still focus on that area, and there are certain things we do in those stores to try to appeal to the customer bases in that area. On the other extreme we have many of those combo stores that serve areas that are higher income and interested in more prepared foods and more perishable foods and so forth. And so the emphasis in those would be in that particular arena. And so, we're really trying to do it pretty logically, I think, although the Dun & Bradstreet data helps us quite a bit in understanding what the customer base is now and the census data helps us to understand what the customer base potentially could be if they're not already shopping in our store. And that helps guide us as well. Now there are -- as many variations on the themes I just described as there are probably are that you can think of you have over lays for ethnicity as an example, local particular – local issues and interests, local skills if one of our divisions and to some of our divisions have different skills than others. And all of those play out, too. Now in a market where we have multiple formats, the same thing is still true except now you have some more extreme examples. You might have for instance in Phoenix you would have the marketplace stores plus a regular combos that price operate is an illustration of that. And the marketplace store addresses itself with a particular approach to merchandising, it doesn't really conflict with what we're trying to do with the combo stores in fact in some way to complement it. I think some customers will shop both stores depending on their objective part of their trip, what they're after. In other markets where we have a Food 4 Less for instance and a combo store, well the Food 4 Less is clearly addressing the value side. We may still have some combos that address the value side but maybe not to the same extreme that a Food 4 Less would. But in that same market we would also operate some high-end stores if we had customers in stores and in the areas where we have customers like that. So, I realize that is not very specific but that’s the overall picture.
A - Michael Schlotman: The other thing that we have found, there is things that we have learned that worsen up Food 4 Less store that you can take across your combo stores where it’s appropriate.
A - David Dillon: Yeah, that’s true.
A - Michael Schlotman: And the same is said for a Fresh Fare there is things that we've learned from that you can take – obviously that would be more at the upscale end. But one of the things that we've all found with a combo stores, it’s very, very flexible to change based on what the customer needs are.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Okay. Anything new going on in prepared foods you want to share with us?
A - David Dillon: Let’s see, the first half of that question is yes, and the second half is no. So, I guess not.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: I should have asked it differently.
A - David Dillon: Prepared foods will always be a changing area, and so we will always have at least as far as I can imagine, we always have new things going on. We'll have some things we tried and didn't like and stopped doing. We'll have some things we tried and do like and keep doing more of and rollout more of, and then we'll have things that were always in the process of developing, and there are plenty of examples in each one of those categories. I don't plan to describe those. But the best way for you to find out is go shop in Kroger.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Right. And last question, I guess for Mike, as you exit San Francisco and Sacramento, what kind of impact will that have in the first half? And is in the full year guidance?
A - Michael Schlotman: It is in the full year guidance. We didn't give any specific guidance on what that effect would be in the first half of the year, but you do have some shut down costs and selling through inventory and maybe some severance, so that is factored into the full year number.
Q - Charles Cerankosky: Alright. Thank you.
A - David Dillon: You're welcome. Thanks, Chuck.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Whitmer of FTN Midwest Research. Please proceed.
Q - Jason Whitmer: Thanks. Good morning and good quarter.
A - David Dillon: Thank you.
Q - Jason Whitmer: Dave, is there any update you can provide us on centralizing your procurement? I have seen some of that through some of the trade publics recently and moving into further divisional consolidation?
A - David Dillon: Sure. What we can tell you is and I think this has been true actually for some time, but you may have seen something on it recently. We have what we call coordinated merchandising concept where we have taken a number of the grocery categories and developed a merchandising plan in one location and then rolled those out throughout the whole company. Now they're tailored to a certain extent to the local markets in addition to that, but essentially it’s being developed in one place. Up until recently that had been, we pretty much stopped that line where we coordinated out west we didn't go all the way to the West Coast. Primarily because our systems were not able to capture the information the way we needed to do it in order for these plans to work and for us to track where we were. As the systems have evolved and we get closer to being able to do that, we wanted to make sure the organization knew where we're headed and where we're headed is to really further to that coordination do the same thing we're doing for probably 2/3rd of the company, now do it for the rest of the company down the road later this year and into next year. And that's essentially what has been announced most recently. In addition to that, we will be increasing the categories that are included in that plan. So we covered a lot of the grocery categories but not all. But we plan to now cover most of those categories and roll that out. Don, do you want to add anything to that?
A - Donnie McGeorge: The only other thing that you may see or hear is that we long used Fred Meyer and the team there on the procurement side for important seasonal products in the GM area. And we will be working toward further integration of planning, utilizing the talents of the Fred Meyer team. And I guess the overall message is this is just a continuation of the things that we've been doing for the past several years.
A - David Dillon: What you probably saw, Jason, was an attempt on our part to make sure that our associates and our vendors were informed and communicated with sufficiently on what we're trying to do. But it really is a continuation of what our plans had been before and I think most of the time people who are actively involved in these jobs in this work pretty much knew the process.
Q - Jason Whitmer: In terms of your divisional consolidation and actually what I am more interested in is potentially adding to your divisions with some acquisition opportunities on the horizon, particularly as it relates to your end market, as you are going to be passing your end market acquisitions. Can you talk further about your opportunities and the success you have had in that in the past?
A - David Dillon: The consolidation in the business keeps causing a number of storage to be available in markets, and sometimes those are whole divisions of a company, sometimes as whole company, sometimes as individual stores. And our position really on this hasn't changed much at all is that we really see the opportunities to be mostly in the markets we're in today where it gives us an opportunity to further the position we already have in that market. That's what served us well in the past. Now there are occasions when opportunities arise that are bigger than that, that are important to us, that have the potential to be really valuable to the shareholders and we don't turn down just because they don't fit the initial descriptions of our strategy. We take a look at what is out there. There is not a day that goes by, that we don't have something under consideration in some place. But well we usually turn down a lot more than what we pursue. And I just expect this next year to look a lot more like it has in the last couple of years. Some stores here and there and some opportunities here and there unless it will continue to consider. Rodney?
A - Rodney McMullen: One of the things today, a lot of the valuation the people have in mind and the valuations that really make sense for us as you noticed over the last couple of years we haven't bought as many as we can before and really is there is a gap between the valuation, what we found overtime that had seems to come back into line.
A - David Dillon: That's a really good point because the effort for us is all reflected on cash flow. Is this a good financial investment on the part of the company to further our business strategy? And if the numbers don't work, we're not interested and Rodney is right about those valuations, some people who wanted to sell assets want to tell them because they think the price is high and the price ends up not being that high.
Q - Jason Whitmer: Great thanks.
A - David Dillon: Welcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Husson of HSBC.
Q - Mark Husson: Yeah, just wanted to ask about the market share dynamics. You talked about volume weighted basis market shares, would that number be significantly different if you did it on a cash basis?
A - David Dillon: When you say cash basis, Mark, help with the explanation because, what we do if a market has a billion dollars of revenue, it counts 10 times more than a market with 100 million of revenue.
Q - Mark Husson: Okay. So, you're not trying to work out your share of volume in the market, you're weighting the markets by the size of markets?
A - David Dillon: By the size of our dollars within the market.
Q - Mark Husson: Okay. And then if you look then its -- and that's the way you've always done it, is it?
A - David Dillon: Correct.
A - Rodney McMullen: Yes.
A - David Dillon: And actually if you do it on an average basis, the number is a little bit better but we never think that's appropriate because it really does need to reflect what's going on in terms of the size of our company.
Q - Mark Husson: And if you look at your share of improvement against supercenters, you would be tempted to argue that the more supercenters there are in the market, the more Wal-Marts there are, the better you do. Is that because it creates a kind of nuclear win for that forces consolidation on everyone else?
A - David Dillon: Mark, I can always tell you to think about this differently than I might have. I’ve never considered the possibility that more Wal-Mart Supercenters might be good for us, interesting approach. I think really what it represents is that in those markets you do have a certain amount of fallout, and in that fallout we end up doing typically, we end up doing better than we would, we had the fallout not occurred and in overtime we're able to compete and hold our own client with the Wal-Mart Supercenters in the town.
Q - Mark Husson: If you look back it’s -- I know you don't talk about markets but occasionally you do. And one of the markets you have mentioned in the past is the Delta market, which is one of the first markets that was sort of supercenterized, And you’ve said in the past that your sales are as good as they've been ever then, the EBITDA margins probably better than its ever been. Is that still you kind of generally trend through?
A - David Dillon: I am not going to speak specifically about Delta. But I’ll tell you generally about our sales and I either said this or maybe hinted at it in our comments. Not only through all divisions all supermarket divisions have positive identicals. All the departments in our grocery store and in our supermarkets had positive identicals. It was very balanced. And the point of that picture to describe to you is that all of our markets did well, that we were pleased in our progress, really every place. And we didn't have one place that did really well and everybody else was sort of in bad shape. So our Delta division and other divisions did very well, and I think similarly well and balanced overall through the year.
A - Rodney McMullen: And the other thing, Mark, that you see, part of it is just the maturity and always when a competitor comes in the first year is more painful than when you get two or three years out. And it’s no different then if you go and look back years ago when Meyer came up, the bad Meyer came into Dayton, Ohio. The initial share change we actually declined for a couple of years, but then after that period of time we started growing the business again. And your market share started improving after you had maturity in the market and some of the things that you said in terms of competitive changes happening. But competitive changes always take longer than what we think they will or should. And that's been true for years.
Q - Mark Husson: Wal-Mart becomes a boring utility center (phonetic) eventually.
A - David Dillon: I wouldn't say or I wouldn’t define in that way. It’s just that what we offer is something different than what Wal-Mart offers and not every customer runs a shop in a supercenter.
Q - Mark Husson: And my final question just, you may have answered it, you tried to increase the percentage of maybe not consciously of general merchandise that you're telling in your stores and increasing the store sizes, is one of the ways you can accommodate that. When are you going to tell us about like Tesco versus the percentage of sales which are general merchandise and whether that is done better than food?
A - David Dillon: I don't know when we'll begin to tell you that but you do size up part of our strategy correctly. It is one of our objectives to increase the sale of general merchandise, and we do that in a variety of ways. Store size is one. The skilled teams we have here at general office who work in this area and also the folks at Fred Meyer who have helped us, too, those two teams have helped us come up with plans that have improved our seasonal and improved our overall general merchandise positioning. You may recall last year, a year ago, I was not as happy with our holiday sales as I would have liked to have been. This year I feel just the opposite. Our holiday sales, and it’s not just general merchandise, but a lot of it is. But our general merchandise and grocery plans that were developed here, general office plans that were worked on and developed further in the divisions, plans that were executed in the stores were much better this year than last year. And so, yes, we're pleased with that direction on general merchandise, expect it will be beneficial to us, but don't plan to at least in the near term give percentages of --
A - Rodney McMullen: Well, I will give you a little bit more insight.
A – Michael Schlotman: You're going to give some?
A - Rodney McMullen: Dave's comment and Don's comment both we view this whole area a huge opportunity for us, and it’s one of the reasons on the organizational changes that Don talked about we're putting in place and when you look at the identical in the Drug GM area, it would be pretty similar to where we are overall as a company the numbers that we released. So, it’s really not that much different. But in terms of opportunity we think the opportunity there is huge, and the changes that we put in place we really do think that will enable us to take better advantage of the opportunity.
A - David Dillon: That's a good point, Rodney and I think the one other element to think about with this is one of the biggest parts of what makes a marketplace store work is the strategy and general merchandise. It’s not just about that. But that is a big part of it. And Rodney is right about the organizational strategy that we have here and will impact that as well.
Q - Mark Husson: That's what's driving Tesco and as they are comfortable with sales right now and I know you view Tesco as a model. And just one final comment any thoughts about Tesco coming into the West Coast into one of your big markets in the south?
A - David Dillon: Well we thought about it obviously. Because they announced it recently. Tesco is a competitor that we admire, have watched for years from the far. We prefer it that way. But once they come to the United States we look – we will see them straight up and we'll see them and welcome them to the environment that we have which is a very competitive environment, one that we are beginning to thrive in and beginning to grow in and beginning to see the ways in which as a competitor that we can even improve on our own performance. So in many ways your earlier point about Wal-Mart does actually make us better and I am sure Tesco will make us better, too, is that's probably the only comment I would add to that.
A - Rodney McMullen: And we've always assumed Tesco is going to come to the U.S. at some point. We just didn't know when.
A - David Dillon: That’s true. So Mark, thank you and we have time for one more question.
Operator: And your next question will come from Scott Mushkin of Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.
Q – Keith Bachman: This is Keith Bachman actually calling for Scott. Just a couple of quick ones today on the call here. In terms of the marketplace store, I was wondering -- I mean it sounds like it’s a strategy for you guys and you just spoke about it in this question. Do you get, I mean it doesn't sound like you've done a whole lot of them. Do you have any – where do you see marketplace going in the next couple of years? Do you see it expanding sort of at a more rapid pace or where would you think going?
A – Michael Schlotman: I would say – as you talk about over the next couple of years I would say its more what you've seen in the last couple that it’s more measured. Because we're continuing to learn what the customer really wants and needs in that format and how to connect. But so far we're pleased with the results and at some point in time you will see as more aggressive. But over the next couple of years I think it will be more of a measured pace to make sure we do it right.
Q – Keith Bachman: Thanks a lot. Just one more or two more quick ones. In terms of you guys give us a lot of color and appreciate all the color on the market share stuff. My only question is it does sound like you’re doing well in the markets where supercenters are operating. – but one thing I was thinking about was seeing Albertsons with some sales numbers down this morning. I mean do you feel -- how significant do you think the presence of not just them specifically but other operators? Are you taking share from other operators as well? How do you sort of view the marketplace in terms of the other operators?
A - David Dillon: I think every market is different, and depends on who the operators are there. Some of the share we pick up. The way we measure share is important to think about all the alternate formats. So we would be drawing we believe from all of those places. We would be drawing from segments that aren't traditionally looked at as supermarkets. We will be drawing from the supercenter area, from some of the competitors and one of the reasons we pointed out that our sales were balanced and strong throughout the whole company was to illustrate that we weren't drawing sales really, we don't believe from just anyone competitor and that's the reason our sales were as strong as they are. We think it is more related to our strategy, and we're pretty excited about it.
Q – Keith Bachman: Okay. And I guess related to that obviously -- I think pretty much answer with that comment. But obviously with more CapEx next year I mean you obviously must be safe some difference in sort of the marketplace and your competitive advantage is sort of ended, is that correct or could you maybe elaborate on that just a little bit?
A - David Dillon: I think the success we've had this past year in our increased -- in our market share that we've reported indicates that we think we're on the right path. And that certainly helps us think about how we spend capital. But there are lots of other elements that go into the capital plan as well. And getting better and understanding how to compete better in today's environment is one of the ways we'll spend our capital money. Anything else? Okay --
Q – Keith Bachman: That's all. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
David Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, appreciate it. Well before we wrap up, let me just close with this. We encourage our associates to listen in on this call, so before concluding the call, I want to thank Kroger’s thousands of associates across all of our banners and operations for your tremendous efforts and dedication to our business in 2005. You are the source of our success. I am gratified by both the big things and the little things you do every day to serve our customers. You continually raise the bar and how we measure our success in meeting customer needs. The progress we've made in 2005 builds on our well developed platform for future growth in 2006 and beyond. You should each see the initiation of a dividend as a major victory. We have not had a dividend since 1988. Many of you are shareholders and will benefit from this decision. We've each had a hand in making it possible. Because of you, Rodney, Don and I are excited about our future together. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. And you may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.

===== 2005 Q3  (2005-12-08 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kroger Company Third Quarter 2005 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Ann Marie and I will be your coordinator for today.  At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.  We will be conducting a question and answer session toward the end of today's conference.  If at any time during the call you require assistance, please press star followed by zero and a coordinator will be happy to assist you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Carin Fike.  You may proceed, please.
Carin Fike: Good morning and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements.  We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially.  A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.kroger.com. Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Dillon.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, Carin.  Good morning, everyone.  We're pleased you could join us to review Kroger's third quarter financial results.  With me today are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Vice Chairman, Don McGeorge, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I'd like to begin this morning by briefly reviewing our third quarter performance and some key areas of our business.  Rodney will share additional details about our results, and then we'll take your questions. Total sales for the third quarter increased 9.1% to $14 billion.  This growth was once again broad-based across the organization, driven by strong sales at the Company's food stores and fuel centers, some improvement in southern California, and a great performance at our convenience stores. This growth continues a very good trend.  Identical supermarket sales increased 6.6% with fuel and 3.7% without fuel.  Once again, by either measure, this represents Kroger's highest identical supermarket sales since the merger with Fred Meyer in 1999.  It also is the ninth consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel.  We're very pleased by this performance.  As we've discussed before, identical sales growth is a key component of Kroger's strategy.  Kroger's business strategy is squarely aimed at consistently meeting the needs of our customers through great service, selection, and value.  To do that, we've taken a page from Kroger's past to build our business for the future.  Some of you may know that back in the 1970s Kroger became the first U.S.  grocer to formalize consumer research.  Since late last year, our Company has been surveying thousands of customers around the country each quarter to ask about their shopping experience in our stores. The great thing about this feedback is that it comes directly from our customers and it clearly identifies areas where we can improve.  We want to know what matters most to them when they choose where to shop.  We also ask customers the same question about their shopping experiences at our competitors so that we can benchmark ourselves and measure our improvement.  Each quarter we share the feedback with our supermarket divisions as one way to help our associates better understand what our customers expect when they visit our stores.  We know that you win one customer at a time and these surveys are a very useful tool.  Kroger's corporate brands continue to be an important competitive advantage.  In the third quarter we added 201 items to the corporate brand line-up.  The market share of Kroger private label grocery items, in terms of dollars, reached nearly 24%, and our share in terms of units was slightly over 31%.  Now turning to southern California, sales and operating profits at Ralphs and Food 4 Less improved during the third quarter as compared to last year. Identical supermarket sales, without fuel at both divisions, on a combined basis increased 2.9% over the prior period.  The pace of our recovery is proceeding slower than we would like.  We see additional opportunities for growth and our teams at Ralphs and Food 4 Less are clearly focused on seizing those.  We continue to be bullish on southern California.  As we're now in the final quarter of our fiscal year, I'd like to remind investors about our earnings guidance for fiscal 2005.  In March, we forecasted that our 2005 earnings would exceed $1.21 per diluted share.  In June, on the strength of our first quarter financial performance, we raised our earnings estimate to exceed $1.24 per diluted share. Now, based on our year-to-date performance through the third quarter, we are confident we will exceed earnings of $1.24 per diluted share as a result of improved results in southern California and the balance of the Company, lower interest expense, and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our stock buybacks.  Now I'll ask Rodney to provide some additional perspective on Kroger's third quarter results.  Rodney?
Rodney McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.  As Dave said, our sales growth during the quarter was very broad-based.  We had growth across all of the country and across all major categories.  All but one of our divisions experienced another quarter of an increased identical supermarket sales.  The strongest categories included produce, grocery, and drug general merchandise across the Company.  Also at Fred Meyer, in addition to these categories, the home fashion and apparel categories were strong.  We estimate product cost inflation during the quarter was 0.4%, that's 0.4%, excluding fuel and 3.4% including fuel.  Kroger reported net earnings of $185.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter.  Net earnings in a year ago period was 142.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Kroger's results for the quarter reflected a variety of items that together had little effect on fully diluted shares earnings per share.  These items include $0.02 of income resulting from the settlement of a previous class action credit card suit and the reversal of an unrelated tax contingency.  These benefits were offset by a combined $0.03 of expense resulting from the impact of Hurricane Katrina and Rita and an increase in certain legal reserves, some of which are nondeductible for tax purposes.  And a write down to fair market value of assets held for sale.  The biggest item was the increase in certain legal reserves.  Our fuel business had a strong quarter in sales, gallons, and margins.  While fuel margins in the quarter were strong, on a year-to-date basis, they were more normalized.  FIFO gross margin was 24.48% of sales, a decline of 62 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the effect of retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin declined 6 basis points from the prior year.  Improvements in strength, advertising, and warehousing allowed us to fund additional investments in lower prices for our customers on a targeted basis.  OG&A declined 69 basis points to 18.23% of sales.  Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A declined 3 basis points as Kroger was able to leverage higher sales to offset higher energy prices and investments in better service.  We estimate that the higher energy prices negatively affected gross margin by 8 basis points and OG&A by 9 basis points for a total of 17 basis points.  Our financial performance in the third quarter reflects the consistent approach we have taken to managing our business.  We continue to balance investments in gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. Capital investments totaled 336.9 million in the third quarter compared to 429.1 million a year ago.  For 2005, we now expect capital investment to come in to the closer to the low-end of our range of 1.4 to 1.6 billion, excluding acquisitions.  Now I'd like to give you a short update on our share repurchase activities.  During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 590,000 shares of stock at an average price of $19.97 for a total investment of $11.8 million.  At the end of the third quarter, there was approximately 158 million remaining under the $500 million stock buyback announced in September, 2004.  Since January, 2000, Kroger has invested $2.9 billion to repurchase 153.1 million shares at an average price of $19.14 per share.  Kroger continues to buyback stock.  Net total debt was $7.2 billion, a reduction of 660 million from a year ago.  Net interest expense totaled 114.2 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from last year.  We have reduced net total debt by $1.6 billion since January, 2000. Over the past four quarters, Kroger's strong cash flow continued to enable us to achieve our financial triple play by reducing net total debt by 660 million, repurchasing 272 million in stock, and making $1.3 billion in capital investments.  Our long-term strategy remains focused on using one-third of cash flow for debt reduction and two-thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend.  As you can see, since 2000 Kroger is in line with that target.  We have the financial resources to continue building our business for the future, which is an important competitive advantage in today's operating environment.  Our investment grade rating is important to us and we're focused on improving our coverages.  Our net total debt to EBITDA ratio in the third quarter was 2.22.  Our best historical performance since the merger with Fred Meyer came in the second quarter of 2002 when our ratio was 2.16.  Our third quarter tax rate was 38.2% for the current year compared to 35% for the prior year. The third quarter, 2004 rate was favorably affected by the settlement of open items with various taxing authorities and the retroactive passage of the work opportunity tax credit legislation.  The third quarter 2005 rate was also favorably affected by the settlement of open items offset by the impact of certain legal expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes.  We expect that our tax rate for fiscal 2005 will be 37.5%.  This is consistent with our prior estimate.  Now a quick update on labor negotiations.  Since our last investor call in September, Kroger has reached new agreements with the UFCW in Atlanta, Roanoke, Columbus, Dallas, and Dayton.  Teamster locals in southern California also ratified new contracts.  With these agreements, we have now completed every major UFCW contract identified for 2005. Kroger generally was able to work with the Unions to craft a balanced agreement that met our objectives for cost reductions or containments while fulfilling our commitment to provide our associates with solid wages and benefits.  We'll be back at the bargaining table in 2006 with a number of contracts covering smaller groups of associates but nothing of the magnitude we faced this year.  Labor negotiations will continue to be a challenge in the face of competitive pressures and rising pension and healthcare costs.  One final note.  We are currently in the process of completing Kroger's business plan for 2006.  As in the past, we will expect to share details of Kroger's business plan when we release fourth quarter results in March, but our strategic focus will remain the same. We will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments and gross margin and improved customer service with operating cost reductions to provide a better shopping experience for our customers.  We expect operating margins in southern California to improve slightly to continued recovery in that market, although the incremental improvement in 2006 will be less than in 2005.  We expect operating margins in the balance of the Company to hold steady.  One thing to keep in mind is that fiscal 2006 will be 53 weeks.  Also we will begin expensing stock options in 2006, which we expect will affect fiscal 2006 earnings by $0.04 to $0.06 per diluted share.  Now we'll turn it back to Dave for some concluding remarks.
Dave Dillon: Thanks, Rodney.  Thanks to the hard work and outstanding contributions of the entire organization, Kroger has made tremendous progress in several key areas this year.  Our associates are offering improved shopping experiences to our customers in a variety of ways.  And Kroger has been able to fund these improvements by taking costs out of our business and improving productivity.  Holiday sales are off to a strong start.  We are focused on becoming more competitive in every aspect of our business so that we can take advantage of growth opportunities and generate value for our shareholders.  During this holiday season, it's important to thank our associates and customers for their generous response throughout the year to help those in need. 2005 has been a difficult year for so many, including those affected by the hurricanes in the Gulf coast.  I'm tremendously proud of the way our customers and our associates at our stores, our manufacturing plants, offices, and distribution centers rallied to help.  Together we raised more than $7 million for the American Red Cross hurricane relief efforts.  Kroger has long understood the importance of giving back to the communities where our customers and associates live and work.  Now others appear to be taking note, too.  Last month, Business Week magazine recognized Kroger was one of the most generous companies in America for our work with schools, food banks, youth groups, and other charitable organizations.  We're proud of that honor and will continue to look for new ways to partner with these organizations in 2006.  We now will be happy to take your questions.
